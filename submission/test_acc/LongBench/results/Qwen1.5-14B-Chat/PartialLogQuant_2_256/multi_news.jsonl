Despite his initial refusal to accept responsibility, he confessed to experiencing \"spiritual pain\" and questioned his role as a Christian. The letter, which was reportedly composed with the help of a priest, reveals a shift in his perspective, as he realized the weapon's misuse by terrorists and criminals.\n\nKalashnikov's letter highlights the moral dilemma he faced, as he designed the rifle to protect his country but became aware of its global proliferation and devastating consequences. The AK-47, now known worldwide, has been used in numerous conflicts and by various insurgent groups, including those employing child soldiers. Despite receiving numerous state honors, Kalashnikov expressed regret for the rifle's unintended uses and lamented its association with violence.\n\nNotably, Kalashnikov converted to Christianity later in life and was baptized.

Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA to antibiotics and impairs the effectiveness of the immune system in combating the bacteria. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes more adept at repelling reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it harder to kill.

{"pred": "Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM), a mysterious and potentially life-threatening condition resembling polio, has gained attention in the United States with a significant increase in cases this year. As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from the previous year's count. The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a viral illness, such as enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), though the exact cause remains uncertain.\n\nIn 2014, there was a surge in AFM cases, with 120 confirmed in the US, leading to concerns about a potential repeat of that outbreak. While EV-D68 was initially suspected, no definitive link has been established. This year, EV-D68 has not been a significant factor in the current outbreak, but doctors are considering other enteroviruses and non-polio enteroviruses.\n\nThe lack of a specific treatment for AFM means that recovery is often partial, with most children showing only minor improvement over time. Symptoms include paralysis, particularly in the limbs, and in some cases, respiratory issues. The condition is challenging to diagnose, and the CDC is urging healthcare providers to report suspected cases, as the number of reports suggests a possible nationwide increase.\n\nIn 2014, the CDC began tracking AFM after an outbreak, and while the cause remains unclear, some researchers are experimenting with treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Prozac. Parents and healthcare professionals are expressing concern about the rising cases, with some clusters reported in states like California, Massachusetts, and Kansas.\n\nThe rarity of AFM, with only a small percentage of cases fully recovering, highlights the urgency for more research into its causes and potential treatments. Parents, like Robin Roberts and Angie Andersen, whose children were affected, are calling for increased awareness and more information about the condition.\n\nAs the CDC investigates, they advise maintaining good hygiene to prevent the spread of potential triggers, such as enteroviruses. The condition's resurgence underscores the importance of vaccinations and vigilance against viral illnesses, particularly during the late summer and early fall when enteroviruses are more prevalent.\n\nIn summary, Acute Flaccid Myelitis, a mysterious and rapidly increasing condition, poses a challenge to medical professionals, with no clear cure and a need for further research to understand its causes and improve treatment options.

What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing.

Their study found that the bloodstains do not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion scenario, such as the angle and consistency of blood flow, particularly on the forearm, hand, and spear wound. The researchers concluded that the stains are inconsistent with a standing or hanging person, suggesting they were likely imprinted on the cloth by a model in different positions, possibly indicating a 14th-century artistic representation rather than a historical artifact.\n\nThe shroud's fame dates back centuries, with radiocarbon dating placing it between 1260 and 1390 CE.

These children are separated from their families due to poverty, lack of resources, or disability, often in deplorable conditions. Research shows that institutions cause significant harm to children's development, increasing the risk of abuse, neglect, and lifelong consequences.\n\nLumos argues that the solution lies in investing in inclusive education, supporting vulnerable families, and promoting alternative care options like fostering and adoption. The organization has seen success in countries like Moldova, where there has been a 70% reduction in institutionalized children since 2007, and the Czech Republic, where admissions have dropped by 75% in some areas. The EU, US, and other international donors are increasingly committing to ending institutionalization, and Lumos aims to eradicate it globally by 2050.\n\nRowling's #Letstalklumos campaign aims to raise awareness about the issue and encourage action.

The memo alleges that the FBI sought a secret court order to monitor Carter Page, a former Trump campaign aide, without adequately disclosing the political motivations behind the surveillance. The FBI and DOJ had concerns about the memo's release, fearing it might compromise sensitive information. President Donald Trump eventually approved the memo's declassification and public release, acknowledging the importance of balancing national security with transparency.\n\nThe memo reveals that the application for a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to surveil Page was based on the Steele dossier, a controversial report compiled by Christopher Steele for the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign. The memo criticizes the FBI for not disclosing the political funding sources and the dossier's political origins to the court.

Named after the Mandarin words for \"rainbow\" and \"big crest,\" the dinosaur had vibrant feathers, particularly on its head, neck, and chest, which displayed colors similar to hummingbirds. The feathers, analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, revealed melanosomes, the pigment-producing structures, suggesting a rainbow-like appearance. Caihong had a theropod body, with a Velociraptor-like skull and crested head, but its feathers indicate a possible connection to early birds, with asymmetric feathers that might have aided in aerodynamic movement.\n\nThe dinosaur's feathers were not only colorful but also diverse, ranging from linear and pennaceous to down-like, indicating a mix of functions, possibly for display and insulation. Its relatively short, robust dentary and the presence of asymmetrical tail feathers suggest it was a predator with a potential role in flight or gliding, although its exact capabilities remain debated.\n\nThe dinosaur's fossil, with its well-preserved feathers, provides valuable insights into the evolution of coloration and display in prehistoric creatures. The discovery pushes the boundaries of what was previously known about dinosaur plumage, revealing a more colorful and dynamic world during the Jurassic era. The presence of iridescent feathers in Caihong suggests that the ability to produce such vibrant colors may have evolved multiple times in the lineage leading to birds.\n\nWhile Caihong's fossil provides a glimpse into its life, more research is needed to understand the precise functions of its feathers and the roles they played in its social behavior and lifestyle.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

Retail giant Costco reacted by prominently displaying the tax impact and directing customers to tax-free locations. Seattle's soda tax exempted beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, causing Starbucks to refuse the tax. The tax's effectiveness in promoting public health was questioned, with opponents suggesting a more comprehensive approach targeting all sugary drinks.\n\nSimultaneously, Cook County, Illinois repealed its soda tax after facing a public backlash and declining sales. The tax, initially imposed by Seattle and later in Philadelphia, faced criticism for being regressive and causing a shift in consumer behavior, with businesses outside the taxed areas experiencing increased sales.\n\nIn Washington state, a bill to introduce a similar soda tax was reintroduced, sparking concerns among local businesses, especially those like Costco, which saw significant price increases. The tax's opponents argue that it unfairly targets low-income individuals and lacks consistency in applying to all sugary beverages.\n\nSeattle's tax backlash highlights the challenges of implementing such policies, as they often fail to achieve their intended health goals and can lead to unintended consequences, such as reduced revenue and shifts in consumer spending patterns.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

{"pred": "A recent study published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics has raised concerns about the potential risks of frequent acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy. Researchers found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen, a commonly recommended pain reliever, had a higher likelihood of their children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related conditions. The study, conducted on 64,000 Danish children, observed a correlation between acetaminophen use and a 29% increased risk of ADHD, particularly when taken chronically or in large amounts. While the study does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship, it suggests that pregnant women may want to reconsider long-term or excessive use of the drug.\n\nExperts caution that the increased risk could be due to factors like viral infections, genetic predispositions, or the drug's potential hormonal effects on fetal brain development. Notably, the study did not compare acetaminophen to other pain relievers like ibuprofen, and further research is needed to clarify the risks. Some experts advise pregnant women to avoid taking acetaminophen unless absolutely necessary and to consider alternative pain management methods like cold compresses or natural remedies.\n\nThe FDA acknowledges acetaminophen's potential liver damage at high doses but emphasizes that it is generally considered safe when used as directed. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the manufacturer of Tylenol, advises pregnant women to consult their doctors before taking any medication, including acetaminophen, and highlights the need for more research to fully understand its impact on fetal development.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate among medical professionals, with some suggesting that the observed association does not necessarily imply causality. ADHD is a complex disorder with both genetic and environmental factors, and the study's authors emphasize the need for a cautious approach to pain relief during pregnancy.\n\nIn conclusion, while acetaminophen remains a common recommendation for managing pain during pregnancy, the emerging evidence calls for pregnant women to weigh the risks carefully and consider alternative treatments, especially if they are taking the drug frequently or for extended periods.

Initially, Brown gained notoriety for his role in the discovery of Eris, which led to Pluto losing its planetary status in 2006 when the International Astronomical Union redefined a planet. Brown and his colleague Konstantin Batygin have now presented compelling evidence for a massive, distant planet they call \"Planet Nine,\" believed to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth and located beyond Pluto's orbit.\n\nTheir research, based on the gravitational influence on nearby dwarf planets and asteroids, suggests the existence of a planet that could be as large as 2-4 times Earth's diameter, causing astronomers to revise their models of the solar system. While Brown admits to some regret for the Pluto controversy, he believes the discovery of Planet Nine could help clarify our understanding of the solar system's formation.

This shift, evident in a study examining over 258,000 patients between 1998 and 2011, highlights the need for reevaluating screening guidelines, as younger patients tend to present with more advanced disease and require different treatment approaches. Younger patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer were found to have a higher likelihood of surgery and radiation therapy, and while they faced more aggressive disease, they also had slightly better survival rates compared to older patients.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of being vigilant for colorectal cancer symptoms in younger adults, as these cancers often go unnoticed due to their subtler presentations. While colorectal cancer was traditionally associated with aging, the findings prompt a call to action for healthcare providers to consider the possibility of the disease in patients below the age of 50, as suggested by the study's authors.\n\nThe increasing number of cases in younger adults raises questions about the appropriateness of current screening recommendations, which currently advise starting at age 50. Some experts argue that family history and certain risk factors might warrant earlier screenings, particularly for those under 50.

More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "Archaeologists have made a groundbreaking discovery in the Flinders Ranges of southern Australia, uncovering a human settlement at the Warratyi rock shelter, estimated to be 49,000 years old. The site, found by chance when a colleague needed a toilet break, holds significance for its age and the artifacts it reveals about early human settlement in the region. The shelter contains sophisticated stone tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, suggesting a complex relationship between humans and large animals like the giant wombat. The presence of these findings pushes back the timeline of human settlement in Australia's arid regions by around 10,000 years, challenging the conventional belief that the first Australians arrived around 50,000 years ago.\n\nThe excavation, conducted in collaboration with the Adnyamathanha people, uncovered a rich cache of artefacts, including 4,300 objects and 200 bone fragments. Optical dating techniques, including single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and single-grain thermoluminescence (TT-OSL), were employed to date the site, providing a more precise chronology. The discovery also includes the oldest-known use of ochre in the region, as well as evidence of early technological advancements like bone and stone tools.\n\nThe site's connection to megafauna, particularly the presence of Diprotodon bones, raises questions about the role of humans in the extinction of these massive creatures, with some experts suggesting that humans might have coexisted and interacted with megafauna, potentially influencing their decline.\n\nThe discovery, published in the prestigious journal Nature, contributes to a reevaluation of the narrative surrounding the adaptability and innovation of early Australians, challenging Eurocentric views on their material culture and technological prowess. The Flinders Ranges site, with its well-preserved stratigraphy, has rewritten several historical milestones, underscoring the rapid expansion of human habitation in the country's arid interior.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

Hooper argues that as the universe expands due to dark energy, civilizations may need to capture energy from distant stars to avoid isolation. To achieve this, they could construct Dyson spheres or other mega-structures, such as solar-powered satellites, to capture and redirect starlight.\n\nHooper suggests that advanced civilizations would prioritize securing energy sources before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe. The process would involve constructing massive, potentially Dyson-sphere-like structures to capture stars' energy, which would be a key indicator of their presence. These structures, like those described in science fiction, would consist of either a continuous shell or millions of satellites, hovering around stars to extract and transmit energy.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres and other energy-harvesting mega-structures has been explored in literature, such as Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\" and Larry Niven's \"Ringworld.\" However, it remains speculative, with humanity currently estimated to be at a relatively early stage (Type I) compared to potential Type II or III civilizations.

{"pred": "A series of groundbreaking discoveries in the field of paleoanthropology challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors. Recent studies, published in Science, suggest that dramatic shifts in East African climate around 320,000 years ago may have driven advancements in toolmaking and the emergence of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their relatives. Researchers found Middle Stone Age tools, the oldest of their kind, indicating a transition from simpler handheld tools to more specialized, long-distance traded obsidian-based implements. These changes suggest increased mobility, resource acquisition, and social networking among hominids.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya provides evidence of these shifts, with a gradual downsizing of tools and the introduction of obsidian tools from faraway sources. The climate in the region, characterized by frequent environmental fluctuations, may have forced early humans to adapt by expanding their foraging territories and engaging in long-distance trade. While it is uncertain if Homo sapiens or a related species created these tools, the presence of obsidian and pigment use points to the possibility of complex social interactions.\n\nThe research aligns with genetic evidence placing the origin of Homo sapiens in Africa around 350,000 to 260,000 years ago. Archaeological evidence from Olorgesailie shows a progression from simple chopping tools to more specialized, purpose-specific Middle Stone Age tools, hinting at the development of modern human cognition and problem-solving abilities.\n\nClimate-induced stress and environmental changes, particularly around 300,000 years ago, are proposed to have accelerated these behavioral changes. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools and pigment use, along with the exchange of raw materials over long distances, implies the existence of early trade networks. This supports the idea that climate variability played a significant role in shaping the development of Homo sapiens and their adaptation to changing environments.\n\nHowever, the exact timing and nature of the transition from the Early to Middle Stone Age remain uncertain due to gaps in the archaeological record. The studies emphasize the need to reconsider the concept of a \"human revolution\" and recognize that complex behaviors and technological advancements emerged gradually across different hominid populations, predating the rise of Homo sapiens. Further research is required to clarify the interplay between climate, technological innovation, and the evolution of modern human traits in the African continent.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The updated process also includes push notifications for mobile app users, allowing them to be informed of boarding start times, a feature particularly useful for managing delays or early boarding.

Previously, Kieran had relied on a hearing aid due to his deafness, which allowed him to hear to some extent. The surgery, while primarily cosmetic, significantly enhanced his self-image and social acceptance, as he had previously struggled at school due to his appearance.\n\nKieran's parents, David and Louise Sorkin, supported his decision to undergo the procedure, which was inspired by a TV program about similar surgeries. The operation, led by plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting rib cartilage and crafting them into ear frameworks, which were then grafted onto Kieran's head. The procedure, though major, resulted in a positive outcome, with Kieran's mother describing the improvement in his confidence and ability to blend in with his peers.\n\nThe surgery highlights the potential of ear reconstructions, with Great Ormond Street Hospital performing about 40 such procedures annually. In the future, advancements in tissue engineering may allow for less invasive methods, such as growing new ears from a patient's own stem cells. Researchers at the University College London's Institute of Child Health are exploring this possibility, aiming to create more natural and less intrusive solutions for children with microtia.\n\nKieran's journey demonstrates the impact of such surgeries on a child's emotional well-being, as it can significantly improve their self-esteem and academic performance.

Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

Federal marshals visited Gibson facilities in Tennessee, seizing a shipment of ebony from Madagascar, citing the Lacey Act, an amendment to protect endangered species, including plants like ebony and rosewood. The company, however, maintains that all its purchases from Madagascar were legal and has provided documentation to support this claim. Director of forest programs for the Environmental Investigation Agency, Andrea Johnson, asserts that Gibson was aware of the risks associated with sourcing from Madagascar and potentially violating the ban on exports, although Gibson denies knowingly doing so.\n\nThe Lacey Act, amended in 2008, requires end-users of endangered wood to verify the legality of their supply chain. Chris Martin, CEO of C.F. Martin & Co., supports the act, stating that illegal logging should be stopped, even if it affects the industry. However, concerns have been raised about the law's retroactivity, as some guitar makers fear being held accountable for past purchases of potentially illegal wood. The Gibson case has led to unease among the guitar community, with fears of potential legal repercussions for sourcing wood from certain countries or even for vintage instruments.\n\nThe raid on Gibson highlights the ongoing tension between the enforcement of environmental regulations and the music industry, with some, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, expressing frustration over the potential for unforeseen consequences.

{"pred": "Recent discoveries shed new light on the water history of Mars, suggesting that the Red Planet once had a significantly wetter past than previously believed. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, covered nearly half of Mars' northern hemisphere, with a depth reaching up to a mile in some areas, according to NASA scientists. This ocean, which persisted for millions of years, was warm and conducive to the possibility of early life. The water, primarily composed of standard hydrogen and deuterium, was found to be highly enriched in deuterium, indicating extensive water loss over time.\n\nThe researchers, using data from the Keck II telescope, NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, mapped the Martian atmosphere and observed a high concentration of deuterium, suggesting that Mars lost an amount of water equivalent to a global ocean 137 meters deep. This water loss supports the theory that Mars was habitable for a longer period than initially thought, potentially allowing for the evolution of life.\n\nAn ocean covering 20% of the planet's surface, with a depth of up to 137 meters, would have provided a conducive environment for life. However, the planet's water gradually disappeared due to atmospheric thinning, leading to the formation of a thick ice cap and the eventual loss of most of its water to space. The discovery of methane in the Martian atmosphere, although not necessarily implying life, adds to the intrigue about the potential for past or present habitability.\n\nWhile the exact amount of water may have been greater than initially calculated, the accumulating evidence points to Mars being a more habitable place in its ancient past, raising the possibility of past or even extant microbial life. Future missions, such as the Exomars rover, will continue the search for signs of life on Mars, with the understanding that a watery and potentially habitable environment once existed on the planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "In a recent development, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has annulled a trademark claim by Nestlé for the shape of the Kit Kat four-fingered wafer, a decision that could impact the protected status of the iconic chocolate bar in the European Union. Nestlé had spent over a decade fighting to protect the shape, but the court ruled that the shape alone was not distinctive enough to warrant exclusive rights. This ruling affects not only Kit Kat but also competitors like Cadbury's Kvikk Lunsj, a Norwegian snack with a similar design, and opens the door to potential generic imitations.\n\nThe case began in 2002 when Nestlé applied for a trademark for the Kit Kat shape, which was initially approved in 2004. However, Mondelez, owner of Cadbury, challenged the decision. In 2016, a lower court found that Nestlé had not provided sufficient evidence of the shape's distinctiveness across all EU countries. The ECJ's recent ruling strengthens the requirement for a product to be distinctive in every member state, not just a significant part, to maintain trademark protection.\n\nThe outcome of this case has implications for other brands, as it sets a precedent for evaluating shape trademarks. While Nestlé may appeal further, the current ruling suggests that the Kit Kat shape may no longer enjoy the same level of legal protection it once did. Meanwhile, other brands like Toblerone and their shapes continue to face scrutiny, with trademark disputes playing out on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn the broader context, the Kit Kat shape case has been seen as a symbol of the ongoing legal battles between global chocolate giants, highlighting the complexities of trademark laws within the EU. The case has also been mentioned in discussions about Brexit, with some arguing that EU courts might affect British brands, like the Kit Kat, despite the potential for national-level trademark protections. Similar disputes, such as the one between Nestlé and Cadbury over the purple color of Dairy Milk bars, demonstrate the ongoing legal challenges faced by these companies in protecting their intellectual property.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic image of the T. rex's roar, suggesting that the dinosaur likely didn't sound like the fierce, high-pitched creature portrayed in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" Scientists argue that the T. rex, along with other dinosaurs, may have produced sounds more akin to today's birds, such as cooing or a low, throaty mumble. These closed-mouth vocalizations, facilitated by an esophageal pouch, are believed to have evolved independently in birds and dinosaurs, with the latter possibly communicating during mating displays or territorial calls.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzes the vocalizations of birds and crocodiles, revealing that about a quarter of bird species exhibit closed-mouth sounds, particularly in those with large bodies like doves and ostriches. The researchers speculate that dinosaurs with large body types, like the T. rex, might have had similar vocal capabilities.\n\nIn the realm of Jurassic Park, the iconic roar was created using a combination of animal sounds, including a baby elephant's cry, tiger's growl, and an alligator's gurgle, resulting in a cinematic effect rather than a scientifically accurate representation. Velociraptors, on the other hand, had sounds influenced by goose vocalizations, with the hissing sound preceding an ambush in the film coming from a goose.\n\nThe study also highlights the mystery surrounding dinosaur sounds, as their vocal cords, crucial for mammalian-style vocalizations, were not present. Instead, researchers suggest that dinosaurs may have communicated through air sacs and possibly bird-like syrinxes, although no definitive dinosaur vocalizations have been preserved due to the lack of fossil evidence.\n\nThe recent findings, combined with the fact that birds' closed-mouth vocalizations have evolved independently in multiple lineages, imply that the ability to produce these sounds could have been present in some dinosaur species, particularly those with large bodies. This opens up the possibility of dinosaurs making sounds like the ostrich-like coo or a less intimidating version of the ostrich's hoot.\n\nAs for the future of dinosaur sound research, the field remains largely speculative, with only a fraction of dinosaur genera discovered. However, the study contributes to our understanding of dinosaur vocalizations, suggesting that these ancient creatures may have communicated in ways that defy popular imagination, with some possibly using bird-like vocalizations in their interactions.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

Tesla confirmed that Autopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control set to its minimum setting, and the driver received warnings before the crash. The severity of the accident was exacerbated due to the damaged crash barrier, which had not been replaced after a prior incident.\n\nTesla's CEO acknowledged that the company's Autopilot system has been shown to significantly reduce crash rates, with internal data suggesting that drivers using Autopilot-equipped Teslas are at a lower risk of fatalities compared to non-Autopilot vehicles. However, the company emphasized that Autopilot is not foolproof and cannot prevent all accidents.\n\nThe investigation into the crash is ongoing, with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) examining the vehicle's data and the condition of the highway barrier. Walter Huang's brother claimed that Walter had complained to the dealership about the car's Autopilot system swerving towards the same barrier before the accident, but the dealership was unable to replicate the issue.\n\nThis incident has brought attention back to the safety of autonomous driving technology, following a separate incident involving an Uber self-driving car that resulted in a pedestrian fatality.

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country held its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its lead, following earlier rounds where it took the lead over the more conservative Nour party. The elections, held amidst ongoing trials of former President Hosni Mubarak, saw the prosecutor accusing Mubarak of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression. Mubarak's trial continued, with the prosecutor demanding a harsh penalty, while Mubarak's health prevented him from attending the court sessions.\n\nThe military-controlled government faces opposition from protesters, who are calling for an end to military rule ahead of the planned presidential elections by June. Economic challenges loom, with Egypt's foreign currency reserves declining and the stock market experiencing significant losses. The new parliament's composition will determine the balance of power, with the Brotherhood aiming to form a coalition government to maintain stability.\n\nThe Brotherhood's potential majority could lead to a more influential role in governance, reducing the influence of rival political groups. The final round of voting saw the Brotherhood attempting to solidify its position, with some analysts suggesting they might secure a majority. However, the outcome remains uncertain due to the complex electoral system and the military's role in the transitional government.\n\nIn Mubarak's trial, the prosecution painted a picture of him as a tyrant, focusing on his alleged efforts to install his son Gamal in power. The court adjourned to resume the trial, with the prosecution arguing for a severe punishment. The military's control over key decisions, such as the formation of a new government, is another point of contention.\n\nOverall, Egypt's political landscape is undergoing significant changes, with the elections and Mubarak's trial reflecting the struggle for power and the desire for accountability, while economic challenges loom large in the backdrop.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "In an unusual incident, a Toyota Corolla driven by Nabila Altahan became suspended from a telephone guy wire in Mendon, Vermont, on Wednesday evening around 8 p.m. The accident occurred when Altahan, following GPS directions, overreacted to a sudden instruction to turn around after passing her intended destination. The car veered off the road and climbed the wire support of a nearby pole, with both Altahan and her passenger unhurt. A witness at a nearby mini-golf course observed the driver exit the vehicle as it dangled from the pole. Local authorities, including the State Police and Rutland City Fire Department, responded to the scene, safely resolving the situation without any further injuries. This incident highlights the potential risks of relying too heavily on GPS technology, especially when interpreting unexpected commands.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP. Police say 30-year-old Nabila Altahan of Dorchester, Mass., was headed west on US Route 4 when she passed her intended destination and reacted quickly to the instructions, leaving the road at a significant enough speed to propel the vehicle up the wires.

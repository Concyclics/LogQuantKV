The letter reveals his struggle with the idea that he might be accountable for the deaths of those who used his weapon, even if it was intended for defensive purposes.\n\nKalashnikov, who was baptized late in life, sought absolution for his invention, which became a symbol of both military defense and terrorism. The Russian Orthodox Church, while supporting the use of weapons for national defense, maintained that Kalashnikov's intentions were initially patriotic.

Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke increases MRSA's resistance to antibiotics and impairs the effectiveness of the immune system in combating the bacteria. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes more adherent to human cells and develops a higher tolerance to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it harder to kill. A similar effect was observed with e-cigarette smoke, but the resistance was found to be more pronounced in MRSA exposed to traditional cigarette smoke.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke acts as an alarm for MRSA, activating its defense mechanisms and enhancing its ability to survive and potentially spread. The increased resistance can persist for up to 24 hours, allowing MRSA to multiply and pose a greater threat to both smokers and non-smokers. The research highlights the dual impact of smoking, not only harming the smoker's health but also aiding in the persistence and virulence of harmful bacteria.\n\nThe study's authors, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, emphasize the need for further understanding of the interplay between smoking and bacterial resistance, as well as the importance of public health messages discouraging smoking to reduce the burden of both smoking-related diseases and the spread of antibiotic-resistant infections.

The policy mentions that users can opt-out of voice recognition, but Samsung will still collect usage data. The SmartTVs gather information on viewing habits, including video content, to provide personalized recommendations, which can be managed through settings.\n\nSimilarly, Microsoft's Xbox One presentation revealed an always-listening feature, allowing the console to respond to voice commands even when off. This move sparked privacy concerns, with critics noting the resemblance to the invasive surveillance depicted in dystopian literature. The new Kinect version can recognize heartbeats and individual voices, raising questions about data sensitivity and the possibility of remote hacking. Microsoft clarified that the system listens for specific cues like \"Xbox on\" and has privacy protections in place, but the persistent listening mode has raised eyebrows.\n\nBoth companies emphasize that data is collected to enhance user experiences, but the persistent surveillance aspect has led to privacy debates.

{"pred": "Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM), a polio-like illness, has gained attention in the United States with a significant increase in cases this year. As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from the previous year's count. The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a respiratory illness or fever. Symptoms include paralysis, particularly in the limbs, and in some cases, respiratory issues.\n\nAFM cases have spiked in 2014 and 2016, with 120 cases confirmed in 2014, compared to 50 in 2015 and an increasing number through July 2016. While the disease was initially associated with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in 2014, the cause remains uncertain, with no definitive link established this year. The CDC is investigating a possible connection to enterovirus, but no specific treatment has been proven to significantly improve outcomes, with recovery rates varying from partial to full in children.\n\nThe condition is concerning because of its rapid onset and the lack of understanding about its causes. Some doctors have reported using intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Prozac as potential treatments, but the long-term effects remain unpredictable. The condition is particularly baffling because it can affect adults as well as children, and the 2014 outbreak coincided with EV-D68, a respiratory virus, but the absence of a widespread EV-D68 outbreak this year raises questions about the role of other viruses.\n\nAs of August, cases have been reported in at least 17 states, with some clusters and a possible increase in EV-D68 infections. The CDC is urging vigilance and monitoring, but more research is needed to understand the disease's causes and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. Parents and healthcare professionals are advised to maintain good hygiene to minimize the risk of transmission.\n\nSome affected children, like 3-year-old Carter Roberts and 6-year-old McKenzie Anderson, have experienced severe paralysis and are undergoing rehabilitation. The rarity of the condition, with only a few recovering fully, highlights the urgency of understanding the illness and its potential links to enteroviruses.\n\nIn 2014, the CDC began tracking AFM, and while the spike in cases this year could be due to increased reporting, the rise in EV-D68 cases", "answers": ["At first, it seemed like 4-year-old Laura Carson was suffering from a simple headache.

Not much is known about the polio-like disease that plagues mostly children, including what causes it. What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing. About 200 kids have been diagnosed since 2014, and this year's figures are especially troubling.

From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully.

Researchers, including Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, have analyzed the cloth using Bloodstain Pattern Analysis. Their study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggests that the stains do not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion scenario, pointing to inconsistencies such as bloodstains on the shroud that cannot be replicated with a realistic body position. The researchers found that the bloodstains on the cloth are inconsistent with a crucified or hanging body, indicating a standing model was likely used to create the image. The study challenges the authenticity of the shroud, although it does not definitively prove it to be a fake. The shroud's fame dates back centuries, with radiocarbon dating placing it between 1260 and 1390 CE, and the Vatican considers it an icon rather than a religious relic.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Ross initially disputed Forbes' assessment, insisting that his wealth was higher than previously reported. This led to an inquiry into Ross' past dealings, revealing a pattern of potential dishonesty stretching back to at least 2004. His reputation was marred by a series of alleged lies, exaggerations, and omissions in his financial disclosures, including omitting assets and underreporting his wealth.\n\nRoss' background includes a successful career in private equity, particularly in the steel industry, where he orchestrated deals that benefited from his connections and strategic moves.

The rebels, seeking an independent state or autonomy, have taken control of the northern part of Mali, including Timbuktu, posing a threat to the country's stability and raising fears of a wider conflict.\n\nWest African leaders, led by President Alassane Ouattara, have responded swiftly by forming a diplomatic committee and imposing sanctions on the junta, but the situation remains tense. The Malian military's inability to counter the rebellion and the potential for external support from other regions, such as Niger, heighten the urgency of resolving the crisis.\n\nThe international community, including UNESCO, has warned of the danger to the UNESCO World Heritage site of Timbuktu, with its unique architecture and historical significance, if the fighting continues. The United Nations Security Council is set to discuss the crisis, emphasizing the need for a peaceful resolution.\n\nFuel shortages and economic sanctions imposed by regional neighbors, including a border closure and冻结 of Mali's central bank account, have led to severe challenges for the country, with fuel supplies dwindling and electricity generation at risk. The junta's failure to effectively combat the rebellion has accelerated the rebels' territorial gains.\n\nNegotiations between the junta and the MNLA are ongoing, but the rebels have stated their preference for independence or autonomy, not full integration into Mali.

The organization's work focuses on countries like Moldova, where there has been a significant reduction in institutionalized children due to their efforts, and the Czech Republic, where the number of children in institutions is decreasing.\n\nThe root cause of institutionalization is often poverty, lack of resources, and inadequate support systems. Research shows that institutions cause measurable harm to children's development, increasing the risk of abuse, malnutrition, and lifelong consequences. Lumos promotes the importance of family-based care, inclusive education, and support for vulnerable families, arguing that investing in these areas is more cost-effective and beneficial for children's well-being.\n\nInternational donors, including the EU, US, and the Global Alliance for Children, are making progress in addressing the issue, but more action is needed.

The ensemble cast, featuring Ashton Kutcher, Jennifer Garner, and various other Hollywood names, fails to create engaging chemistry, and the film is described as a disappointment in comparison to the hype surrounding it.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Valentine's Day\" is a disaster, criticized for its lack of humor, reliance on tired tropes, and a star-studded cast that struggles to bring any depth to their roles.

The company's performance, marked by falling oil prices and a major loss, led to a shareholder rebellion, with a majority voting against the executive pay decisions at the annual general meeting. Advisory firms like Glass Lewis and the Institute of Directors criticized the pay hike, arguing that it did not reflect the company's performance.\n\nGlass Lewis, a prominent shareholder advisory group, has consistently recommended against Dudley's pay increase, citing the need for shareholders to see \"fuller justification\" for the bonuses. The company's board, however, defended the pay package, highlighting Dudley's achievements in managing the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster and improving safety records. Despite the non-binding nature of the shareholder vote, the outcome sent a strong message, with some suggesting it could lead to stricter regulations on executive pay in the future.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell's CEO, Ben van Beurden, also saw a reduction in his pay, while Dudley's pay was less than some of his peers in the energy sector.

The movie, starring Saoirse Ronan as the murdered 14-year-old protagonist, Susie Salmon, attempts to capture the book's sentimentality and the supernatural world she observes from the afterlife. However, the film struggles to balance the contrasting aspects of the story, focusing too heavily on the gruesome details of the murder and the killer's twisted activities, which undermines the more tender aspects of Susie's family's grief and their search for justice.\n\nJackson's directing prowess is evident in the visually stunning depiction of the in-between world, but the film's shift towards horror elements, particularly the portrayal of the murderer, George Harvey, played by Stanley Tucci, creates an imbalance. The film's choice to emphasize these darker elements, at times bordering on gratuitous, detracts from the overall narrative. Despite the strong performances by Ronan, Wahlberg, and Weisz, the film's inconsistent tone prevents it from achieving the same impact as the book.\n\nWhile the movie has its moments of beauty and resonance, particularly in its exploration of Susie's journey and the idea of a comforting afterlife, it fails to strike a cohesive balance between the fantastical elements and the grounded reality of the characters' lives.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

Target's breach, which occurred during the holiday season, saw the theft of credit and debit card data from 40 million customers, with an estimated 70 million additional individuals having had personal information stolen. Both breaches have raised concerns about cybersecurity and prompted investigations by state attorneys general.\n\nThe Neiman Marcus breach initially went undisclosed until December, with the company stating that they took action after discovering suspicious activity involving stolen credit cards. The company's delay in notification led to criticism, contrasting with Target's prompt disclosure following a similar incident. Target's breach was attributed to a sophisticated malware attack, with the hackers using memory scraping techniques to access encrypted credit card data while it was in the system's memory.\n\nA 17-page report by computer firm iSight, examining the Target breach, revealed that the attack was part of a broader international hacking campaign targeting multiple retailers. The malware used in the attack was sophisticated and allowed hackers to steal data covertly, bypassing common security measures. The report suggests that the type of attack could become more prevalent due to its profitability and low risk for the attackers.\n\nBoth retailers are under investigation, with Neiman Marcus apologizing and acknowledging the breach without specifying the scale.

In a study examining over 258,000 patients, about 15% were diagnosed before the age of 50, with younger patients more likely to have advanced-stage cancer and require aggressive treatment. Although younger patients tend to have more advanced disease, they also have slightly better survival rates due to earlier detection and treatment. The study highlights the need for earlier screening, possibly as low as age 40, particularly for those with a family history of the disease or certain risk factors.\n\nThe research underscores the importance of recognizing colorectal cancer symptoms in younger patients, as they often present with less noticeable signs. Colorectal cancer rates are projected to rise, with rectal cancers affecting nearly one in four and colon cancers one in 10 patients under 50 by 2030. Some experts argue that guidelines may need to be revised, while others caution against unnecessary testing for young, low-risk individuals.\n\nDr. Samantha Hendren's team at the University of Michigan calls for a reevaluation of risk assessment and screening recommendations for younger adults, as early detection could improve outcomes. However, the study's limitations include lack of family history data and concerns about the potential for selection bias in treatment decisions.\n\nBowel symptoms, such as blood in stool, should not be overlooked, and doctors should be vigilant in diagnosing and treating colorectal cancer in younger patients. While the exact reasons for the rising trend are unclear, factors like smoking, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle may contribute to the shift in demographics.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

{"pred": "Archaeologists have made a groundbreaking discovery in southern Australia, uncovering a human settlement at the Warratyi rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, dating back to around 49,000 years ago. The site, found by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local elder Clifford Coulthard, holds significant implications for understanding human settlement in the region. It challenges the conventional timeline, suggesting that humans may have arrived in Australia earlier than previously believed, possibly as early as 55,000 to 60,000 years ago. The shelter contains sophisticated tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, indicating a complex relationship between early humans and Australia's giant animals.\n\nThe excavation uncovered 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, revealing advanced technologies like fire-making, sophisticated stone tools, and the use of ochre. Optical dating techniques, including single-grain optically stimulated luminescence and quartz grain analysis, were employed to date the site, providing a more precise timeline. The presence of megafauna bones suggests hunting, while the absence of large-scale burials suggests a shift in settlement patterns as the climate became more arid.\n\nThe discovery pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the arid zone and challenges the notion that humans arrived in Australia later due to harsh climatic conditions. The site, particularly the Warratyi rock shelter, contributes to a reevaluation of the continent's colonization patterns and the role of humans in the extinction of megafauna, as it demonstrates coexistence and potential hunting practices.\n\nThe find, which includes the oldest-known use of ochre and evidence of local technological advancements, underscores the adaptability and innovation of early Australians. The site's significance extends beyond its age, as it also connects with local Indigenous knowledge, as shared by Clifford Coulthard, and strengthens the narrative of the continent's rich cultural history.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "This news summary discusses the concept of advanced civilizations expanding and harnessing energy in the universe, as outlined by astrophysicist ideas and recent research. The article begins by explaining the three stages of technological advancement, proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, where civilizations progress from capturing a planet's resources (Type I), to a star's energy (Type II), to a galaxy's resources (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that as civilizations advance, they would inevitably seek to capture energy from distant stars to counteract the expanding universe's isolation. Dark energy-driven expansion threatens to make stars beyond our Local Group inaccessible, necessitating the capture of energy sources.\n\nHooper proposes that advanced civilizations would employ massive structures like Dyson spheres, consisting of solar-powered satellites, to collect and redirect starlight. These structures, inspired by science fiction concepts like Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\" and Freeman Dyson's proposal, would surround stars and capture their energy. The search for such civilizations could involve observing unusual light signatures, such as galaxies with missing stars or those showing signs of energy manipulation.\n\nWhile humans are currently at a relatively early stage of technological development, with Earth estimated to be around Kardashev Scale Type 0.7, the possibility of alien civilizations far more advanced exists. These civilizations would need to capture stars to secure energy before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe. The hunt for such advanced life forms could involve monitoring for unusual light signatures, such as Dyson spheres or manipulated starlight, as indicators of star-harvesting activity.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the theoretical progression of civilizations towards energy-harvesting strategies, driven by the need to secure resources in the face of dark energy's expansion.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

She initially battled a fever and was diagnosed with a severe UTI, which led to the discovery of stage 3 kidney reflux and moderate ASD with pulmonary stenosis. Oakleigh's left kidney has 22% functionality, and she is scheduled for surgery to correct the reflux and potentially improve her kidney function. The surgery aims to prevent future infections, as Oakleigh has been battling antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas infections, a common but dangerous bacteria.\n\nPseudomonas infections, including the strain Oakleigh contracted, are caused by P. aeruginosa and can affect individuals, particularly those who are weak or immunocompromised. They are challenging to treat due to their resistance to multiple antibiotics. Oakleigh's case highlights the importance of monitoring and treating infections effectively, as overuse of antibiotics can lead to resistant strains.\n\nIn another story, an Oklahoma infant, Oakleigh, contracted a \"super strain\" of E. coli, which is particularly concerning due to its potential to spread to vital organs and the fact that her previous health issues have limited available antibiotics. The family is praying for a positive outcome, and Oakleigh's upcoming kidney surgery, despite the risks, is seen as a potential lifeline.\n\nBoth Oakleigh's cases emphasize the importance of timely medical intervention, antibiotic resistance, and the need for continued research and vigilance in preventing and treating infections, especially in vulnerable infants and patients with pre-existing conditions. The families are relying on community support, as Oakleigh's grandfather appeals to the public for prayers and financial assistance through a GoFundMe campaign to cover medical expenses related to her surgeries and ongoing care.", "answers": ["An Oklahoma girl diagnosed with \"super\" E. coli is facing a life-or-death battle—and worse, she's only 11 months old. \"With this strain of E. coli, it can get in her brain, it can get in her spinal cord, basically cause her to go into cardiac arrest,\" her grandfather, Chris Curtis, tells KFOR. \"And we heard that it was a very, very scary situation.\" Her family says it's not clear how Oakleigh Nance got the infection, which appears resistant to antibiotics, but the CDC is investigating. It all started when Oakleigh was born premature at only 3 pounds and \"started off on 4 liters of oxygen,\" according to a GoFundMe page to help pay her medical bills. \"In the NICU, they used to call her Miss Sassy because of her ability to express her displeasure with her circumstances,\" the page says.

Since then, she's been diagnosed with moderate ASD and pulmonary stenosis of the heart, stage 3 kidney reflux, and \"a dangerous, antibiotic resistant strain of Pseudomonas,\" says the GoFundMe page. Now doctors are planning a 4 1/2-hour procedure on her kidney, which is functioning at 22%, to possibly prevent other infections. \"I know that God is in control of all else, and when I think about what’s going on in her life, I think about my faith in God,\" says Curtis. \"That’s what sustains me and gets me through it.\" (Read about a brain-eating bacteria that has returned to Louisiana.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1463}

{"pred": "A series of recent discoveries in the field of paleoanthropology and archaeology challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of early human cultures. Researchers have uncovered evidence suggesting that dramatic shifts in toolmaking and social organization occurred much earlier than previously thought, possibly around 320,000 years ago in East Africa. This shift, marked by the emergence of Middle Stone Age tools and the use of obsidian from distant sources, may have been driven by climate changes that forced early humans to expand their foraging territories and develop trade networks.\n\nThe excavations in Olorgesailie, Kenya, reveal a progression from simpler, locally sourced stone tools to more specialized, Middle Stone Age implements, indicating increased adaptability and innovation. The discovery of obsidian tools, often associated with Homo sapiens or their relatives, suggests long-distance communication and trade, possibly facilitated by the need to secure resources in response to unpredictable food sources due to shifting landscapes.\n\nThe research also connects these changes to the emergence of Homo sapiens, with some arguing that the development of sophisticated tools and trading networks were key to their success. However, the exact timeline and the identity of the toolmakers remain uncertain, as no definitive fossils have been found at Olorgesailie. Climate fluctuations, particularly droughts and wet cycles, were proposed to have played a significant role in shaping these behaviors.\n\nThe Olorgesailie findings align with genetic evidence placing the origin of Homo sapiens in Africa around 350,000 to 260,000 years ago. The study of tool variations across Africa during the Stone Age highlights the potential for complex thinking and social networking even among pre-Homo sapiens populations.\n\nThe Olorgesailie discoveries, along with the earlier Middle Stone Age tools, suggest a gradual transition from simpler to more specialized tools, possibly signaling the emergence of modern human traits. However, the precise timing and species responsible for these advancements remain open questions, with climate change and cultural exchange playing crucial roles in the development of early human societies.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Initially, Hooper disliked Cruz due to his violent behavior, but over time, she discovered a caring side to him. Despite facing numerous challenges, including Cruz's unstable home life, Hooper took him in and eventually adopted him when he was 12 years old after his biological mother asked her to keep him temporarily. She provided a stable environment, support, and guidance, helping him overcome his academic struggles, change his behavior, and even adopt her last name, Hooper, when he was legally adopted at 30. This act of love and dedication transformed Cruz's life, turning him from a troublesome student to a successful adult with a strong bond to his adoptive family.\n\nThe second passage tells the story of a teacher's unwavering commitment to a student named Cruz, whose frequent outbursts and challenging circumstances initially made him a \"holy terror\" at school. Cruz, who faced abuse at home, found solace in his teacher's patience and eventually moved in with her and her family after his mother couldn't cope with his situation. His relationship with his teacher's husband grew, leading to a life-changing decision to formally adopt Cruz, symbolizing his acceptance and the deep bond that formed between them.\n\nBoth stories highlight the power of love, understanding, and the ability of teachers to make a lasting impact on their students' lives.

He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather.

The 2006 Military Commissions Act (MCA) revoked habeas corpus rights for certain individuals labeled \"enemy combatants,\" allowing the executive branch to detain suspects outside the traditional court system. Detainees at Guantanamo Bay, particularly those without substantial evidence, have faced indefinite detention and lack of access to fair trials. The Supreme Court's ongoing examination of habeas corpus cases at Guantanamo represents a potential check on executive overreach.\n\nThe second passage reports a significant legal milestone when a New York court granted a writ of habeas corpus to two chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, at Stony Brook University, making them the first animals in U.S. history to receive such a legal remedy. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP) filed the lawsuit, arguing that the chimps' cognitive abilities and emotional complexity qualify them for the right to liberty. The case challenges the traditional view of animals as property and could pave the way for further legal recognition of animal rights, potentially influencing future legal decisions on the treatment of animals in captivity, especially in research settings.\n\nBoth news stories emphasize the erosion of legal protections for individuals and the growing interest in recognizing non-human entities, like animals, as having rights and deserving legal standing.

{"pred": "Recent studies have shed new light on the water history of Mars, revealing a massive ancient ocean that once covered a significant portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. A team of scientists, using data from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and other observatories, discovered that a large body of water, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once existed on Mars, comparable to the Atlantic Ocean's volume. This ancient ocean, which was up to a mile deep, persisted for millions of years, providing a potentially habitable environment for early Mars.\n\nThe ocean's existence is inferred from the high concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, in the Martian atmosphere. As water evaporated over time, the planet lost a significant amount of water, leaving behind a higher proportion of deuterium. This indicates a substantial water loss, with the potential for a global ocean that could have reached up to 137 meters in depth.\n\nThe findings challenge previous beliefs about the intermittent nature of water on Mars, suggesting a more consistent presence of liquid water, supporting the possibility of a wetter and warmer past. This environment raises the likelihood of habitability and the potential for early life on the planet. Notably, the Curiosity rover has already detected signs of standing water for 1.5 billion years, and the recent detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere adds to the intrigue.\n\nWhile the exact extent of the ancient ocean may have been even greater than initially thought, with some estimates suggesting it covered about half the planet's northern hemisphere, the research provides crucial insights into Mars' evolutionary history. As the search for life on Mars continues, the accumulating evidence points to a more conducive environment for life to have emerged in the past, although the presence of life remains speculative.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Nestlé had been attempting to trademark the shape of its Kit Kat bar in Europe for over a decade, but the ECJ ruled that the shape alone is not distinctive enough to warrant trademark protection. This decision affects not only Kit Kat but also other similar snacks like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which can now potentially use the shape without fear of infringing on Nestlé's claims. The case highlighted the need for a product to be distinctive in every EU market, not just a significant part, for a trademark to be upheld. The Kit Kat shape may still be protected in some countries, but the ruling sets a precedent for future trademark applications.\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing legal dispute between Nestlé and Mondelez over the Kit Kat shape has implications for businesses operating within the EU, as it emphasizes the importance of proving distinctiveness across all member states. The case has also been compared to other trademark battles, such as Cadbury's attempt to trademark the purple color of its Dairy Milk bars, which faced similar challenges. The outcome of these cases suggests that the burden of proof for trademark protection is becoming stricter, requiring clear evidence of distinctiveness in all relevant markets.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable.

{"pred": "New research on dinosaur vocalizations challenges the iconic T. rex roar from popular culture, revealing that the sound of the mighty dinosaur may have been quite different from what we're accustomed to seeing in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" Scientists argue that the T. rex, despite its fearsome reputation, likely made sounds more akin to today's birds, with closed-mouth vocalizations that could have resembled the coo of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich. These sounds, produced through an esophageal pouch, were low-frequency and possibly used in defense or mating displays. The study, published in the journal Evolution, suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved at least 16 times in birds and could have been present in some non-avian dinosaurs due to their potential for large body size and the presence of an esophageal pouch.\n\nThe creation of dinosaur sounds in movies, such as the T. rex's roar, relied heavily on creative sound design. For instance, the iconic T. rex roar in \"Jurassic Park\" was a composite of various animal sounds, including a baby elephant, tiger, and an alligator, to achieve a cinematic effect. Velociraptors, on the other hand, had sounds influenced by goose and tortoise vocalizations, while the raptors' hissing and hissing attack noises were sourced from a goose.\n\nThe study also highlights the possibility that dinosaurs, like birds, may have had a syrinx, a bird-like vocal organ, and that their vocalizations were likely quiet and throaty, unlike the loud, open-mouthed calls associated with mammals. The authors suggest that without vocal cords, dinosaurs may have communicated through air sacs, creating a unique form of vocal expression.\n\nWhile the exact dinosaur sounds remain largely speculative, the research points to a world where dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies, might have had bird-like vocal abilities. The study underscores the complexity of dinosaur communication and the ongoing efforts to understand their vocalizations based on comparative anatomy and evolutionary patterns.\n\nAs for the future of dinosaur research, the field is far from exhaustive, with paleontologists estimating that only a fraction of dinosaur genera have been discovered. The study of dinosaur sounds, like their physical characteristics, is an area ripe for exploration, offering a glimpse into the rich tapestry of prehistoric life.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

Bayesian statistics, a mathematical approach initially developed by Thomas Bayes, is being employed to refine the search for the aircraft and help solve the mystery. Bayesian statisticians update probability estimates based on factors like flight path, wind patterns, and previous search areas, considering both accidental and deliberate causes of the disappearance. Bayesian methods have been successful in previous searches, such as locating Air France Flight 447 in 2011, where the team at Metron Scientific Solutions, including Lawrence D. Stone, used Bayesian calculations to analyze data and adjust search areas. The search for Flight 370 involves not only geographical coordinates but also the probability of the plane being intact or damaged, with new information suggesting a deliberate diversion increasing the likelihood of the plane being further from the original departure point.\n\nStatisticians face challenges in the search due to limited historical data and the need to quantify subjective judgment. The search area is vast, and the cause of the disappearance, believed to be more likely a deliberate act, influences the probability distribution. Bayesian methods are adaptable, allowing for updates as new information emerges, but critics argue that they may not be suitable when the situation drastically changes, as in the case of Flight 370, where the focus is on the probability of the plane being intact or damaged.\n\nThe search for Flight 370 has involved international collaboration, with the French government's involvement in the case of Air France 447, which helped refine search strategies.

Trey Gowdy, has released a final report that reveals discrepancies between the public statements made by the Obama administration and internal communications during the attack. The report claims that the administration initially tried to downplay the role of terrorism and instead focused on the supposed connection to an anti-Islam video, which was later determined to be a false narrative. The report highlights a concern expressed by State Department officials during the attack that Marines' uniforms might hinder diplomacy, leading to discussions about the possibility of them wearing civilian clothing. However, despite the military not deploying to Benghazi, the report accuses the administration of providing a false account of the attack, particularly regarding the cause and motivation.\n\nThe report also disputes the claim that the attack was a spontaneous protest over a video, stating that it was a well-planned terrorist operation. The controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the situation, including the contradictory public statements, has led to accusations of a cover-up and a lack of accountability. Representative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, expresses disappointment in the partisan nature of the investigation and the withholding of information from the public. He asserts that the facts remain consistent, stating that the report does not change the understanding of the attack, which involved no stand-down order, no attempt to politicize the situation, and no evidence of gun trading.\n\nThe report's release adds fuel to the political debate, with the summary accusing Hillary Clinton and her administration of providing a false narrative to the public, potentially to protect the image of diplomacy. Cummings argues that the report's new details do not alter the core facts, but rather emphasize the need for transparency and accuracy in future investigations.", "answers": ["The Republican-led House Benghazi committee released its final report Tuesday after two years of investigations.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked.

(Just to keep things in perspective, we'll point out that Look is the sort of magazine that also runs headlines like, \"Royal Bodyguard Warns: 'Kate Middleton's Baby Is In Danger!'\") In other news, Huffington Post notes that it's Cruise's 51st birthday."], "all_classes": null, "length": 790}
{"pred": "Billionaire couple Barry and Honey Sherman, founders of Apotex Inc., were found dead in their Toronto mansion under suspicious circumstances. The police initially classified the deaths as \"ligature neck compression,\" suggesting suicide, but the family dismissed the theory, stating it contradicted their parents' personalities. The couple, who were due to embark on their annual trip to Florida, were last seen making holiday plans. Police are investigating the deaths as a homicide, with early theories pointing to murder-suicide, though this remains unconfirmed. Friends and colleagues remember Barry as a workaholic and Honey as a philanthropist who enjoyed socializing. The couple's recent activities, including attending events and planning a dinner party, did not indicate any distress. Barry's net worth was estimated at $4.77 billion, and the couple had no apparent financial issues.

Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later.

{"pred": "In the wake of Egypt's first parliamentary elections since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak, Egyptians voted in the third round, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to lead, possibly securing a majority. Mubarak's trial continued, with prosecutors accusing him of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression. The military-controlled government faces opposition from protesters demanding an end to military rule and a swift transition to civilian leadership. Economic challenges, including a decline in foreign currency reserves and a struggling stock market, loom as the country prepares for the new parliament's inaugural session on January 23.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood aims to maintain its position as the leading political force, with some estimating it could secure a majority in the new parliament. However, the Brotherhood's intention is to form a coalition or unity government to balance power and address concerns from liberals and Western allies. The ultraconservative Salafi parties, like the Nour party, are also gaining ground.\n\nIn Mubarak's trial, prosecutors demanded a harsh penalty, focusing on his alleged role in the deaths of protesters during the 2011 uprising. The trial's outcome could impact the power dynamics in the country, with the military generals facing calls to cede authority to a civilian government. The situation remains tense, with clashes and protests continuing, particularly ahead of the one-year anniversary of Mubarak's ouster.\n\nThe economic situation is deteriorating, with a slowdown in growth and a significant drop in foreign reserves. The new parliament's composition and its relationship with the military rulers will be crucial in shaping the country's future, with the possibility of a coalition government involving the Brotherhood and other parties to ensure stability. The trial of Mubarak and his sons highlights the ongoing struggle for accountability and the legacy of the former regime.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

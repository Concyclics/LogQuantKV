{"pred": "Recent research has revealed a concerning connection between cigarette smoke and the virulence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke increases MRSA's resistance to antibiotics and impairs the effectiveness of the immune system in combating the bacteria. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes more adherent to human cells and develops a higher tolerance to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it harder to kill. A similar effect was observed with e-cigarette smoke, but the resistance was found to be more pronounced in MRSA exposed to traditional cigarette smoke.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke acts as an alarm for MRSA, activating its defense mechanisms and enhancing its ability to survive and potentially spread. The increased resistance can persist for up to 24 hours, allowing MRSA to multiply and pose a greater threat to both smokers and non-smokers. The study also highlights the importance of cigarette smoke in altering the bacteria's cell walls, making it more resistant to immune defenses.\n\nThe research not only affects smokers, who are already known to be more susceptible to infections, but also suggests that the bacteria's enhanced resistance could complicate treatment and contribute to the spread of antibiotic-resistant infections.

As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from the previous year's count. The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a respiratory illness or fever. Symptoms include paralysis, particularly in the limbs, and in some cases, respiratory issues.\n\nAFM cases have spiked in 2014 and 2016, with 120 cases confirmed in 2014, compared to 50 in 2015 and an increasing number through July 2016. While the disease was initially associated with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in 2014, the cause remains uncertain, with no definitive link established. This year, EV-D68 has not been a significant factor in the current outbreak, but some doctors suspect a correlation.\n\nThe condition is particularly concerning due to the lack of effective treatments, with most patients showing only partial recovery. Symptoms usually manifest within days to weeks, and recovery rates are variable, with some children recovering partially while others remain paralyzed. The CDC is monitoring the situation closely, urging healthcare providers to report suspected cases and investigating the role of enteroviruses, including EV-D68, in triggering AFM.\n\nIn addition to EV-D68, other enteroviruses and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus have also been associated with AFM. The CDC is advising good hygiene practices to prevent the spread, but no specific treatment has been proven to significantly improve outcomes.\n\nParents and healthcare professionals are alarmed by the recurrence of the condition, with some cases resembling the 2014 outbreak. Cases have been reported in multiple states, with no clear pattern in terms of geographic clustering. The condition is still relatively rare, but the rise in cases has raised concerns among experts, who call for more research to understand its causes and potential prevention strategies.\n\nAffected families, like the Roberts and Andersen households, have faced significant challenges, with children experiencing sudden paralysis and long-term disabilities.

Ross initially disputed Forbes' assessment, insisting that his wealth was higher than previously reported. This led to an inquiry into Ross' past dealings, revealing a pattern of potential dishonesty stretching back to at least 2004. His reputation was marred by a series of alleged lies, exaggerations, and omissions in his financial disclosures, including omitting assets and underreporting his wealth.\n\nRoss' background includes a successful career in private equity, particularly in the steel industry, where he orchestrated deals that benefited from his connections and strategic moves. His firm, WL Ross & Co., faced controversies, including lawsuits and misrepresentations to investors. Ross' confirmation to President Trump's cabinet was met with scrutiny, as he failed to disclose several lawsuits and misled about the extent of his assets. His post-Cabinet appointment saw him attempting to justify a large transfer of assets to avoid disclosing them, which fueled questions about conflicts of interest and ethics.\n\nThroughout his career, Ross' wealth narrative was often inflated, with Forbes listing him as a billionaire based on assumed funds belonging to his investors.

Rowling, known for her work with the charity Lumos, writes about the plight of millions of children worldwide who are unjustifiably separated from their families and confined in institutions. Inspired by a photograph of a caged child, Rowling founded Lumos to advocate for ending the institutionalization of children, which she believes is a global issue that can be eradicated by 2050. The organization's work focuses on countries like Moldova, where there has been a significant reduction in institutionalized children due to their efforts, and the Czech Republic, where the number of children in institutions is decreasing.\n\nThe root cause of institutionalization is often poverty, lack of resources, and inadequate support systems. Research shows that institutions cause measurable harm to children's development, increasing the risk of abuse, malnutrition, and lifelong consequences. Lumos promotes the importance of family-based care, inclusive education, and support for vulnerable families, arguing that investing in these areas is more cost-effective and beneficial for children's long-term well-being.\n\nThe #LetstalkLumos campaign aims to raise awareness about the issue and encourage international donors to prioritize ending institutionalization. With growing support from the European Union, the United States, and other organizations, there is hope that the global effort to eradicate institutionalization can be successful, leading to a future where children live with their families and communities rather than being confined in institutions.\n\nRowling's personal connection to the cause is evident in her commitment to Lumos, and she envisions a world where the concept of institutionalizing children is a relic of the past.

Found in northeastern China's Hebei Province, the dinosaur had rainbow-colored feathers, similar to those of a hummingbird, covering its head, neck, and chest. The feathers, revealed through microscopic examination, suggest a vibrant palette, hinting at a more colorful world during that era than previously thought.\n\nCaihong had a theropod body, with a Velociraptor-like skull and crested appearance, but its feathers indicate a closer link to birds. It possessed both simple and asymmetrical feathers, with the latter possibly aiding in aerodynamic movement. The dinosaur's feathers were not only for display but also possibly served as insulation and possibly for flight, although its small size and probable inability to fly are debated.\n\nThe dinosaur's plumage was diverse, with long, linear feathers on the head, neck, and body, and short, sinuous feathers on the tail.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

He initially questioned the validity of the polls, asking \"Says who?\" and later clarified that Trump was \"colourblind\" but acknowledged the \"African American problem\" in the country, referring to racial tensions following a police-related incident.\n\nAmidst the campaign shake-up, Trump's team added new officials to regain favor, including Breitbart News' CEO Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager.

However, the film struggles to balance the contrasting aspects of the story, focusing too heavily on the gruesome details of the murder and the killer's twisted activities, which undermines the more tender aspects of Susie's family's grief and their search for justice.\n\nJackson's directing prowess is evident in the visually stunning depiction of the in-between world, but the film's shift towards horror elements, particularly the portrayal of the murderer, George Harvey, played by Stanley Tucci, creates an imbalance. The film's choice to emphasize these darker elements, at times bordering on gratuitous, detracts from the overall narrative, despite the strong performance by Ronan.\n\nThe film's adaptation, while featuring a captivating premise, fails to strike the right balance between the fantastical elements and the emotional journey of the characters.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

The forecast, which predicted widespread home failures, water shortages, and weeks of unhabitability, accurately depicted the severity of Hurricane Katrina. Ricks' decision to use strong language, reflecting the gravity of the situation, was a departure from typical government forecasts but proved effective in capturing the public's attention.\n\nIn the days leading up to the storm, Ricks, working at the Slidell, Louisiana office, prepared a forecast that was both dire and historically significant. His forecast, which included phrases like \"most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks\" and \"water shortages will make human suffering incredible,\" was a stark reminder of the potential disaster. Despite the fear of being overly cautious, Ricks felt compelled to issue such a severe warning based on the expertise of his team and their assessment of the situation.\n\nRicks' forecast, which has since become a part of the Smithsonian Museum of American History, highlights the importance of clear and impactful communication during extreme weather events. The National Weather Service has since recognized the need for more expressive forecasts to grab public attention, as seen in meteorologist Gary Szatkowski's \"personal plea\" during Hurricane Sandy.\n\nThe story underscores the emotional weight that comes with making life-altering predictions and the personal responsibility meteorologists like Ricks carry in their roles.

In a study examining over 258,000 patients, about 15% were diagnosed before the age of 50, with younger patients more likely to have advanced-stage cancer and require aggressive treatment. Although younger patients tend to have more advanced disease, they also have slightly better survival rates due to earlier detection and treatment. The study highlights the need for earlier screening, possibly as low as age 40, particularly for those with a family history of the disease or certain risk factors.\n\nThe research underscores the importance of recognizing colorectal cancer symptoms in younger patients, as they often present with less noticeable signs. Colorectal cancer rates are projected to rise, with rectal cancers affecting nearly one in four and colon cancers one in 10 patients under 50 by 2030. However, experts debate whether to alter screening guidelines, with some suggesting that family history and early-onset symptoms should prompt earlier screenings.\n\nWhile the study provides valuable insights, it also points out limitations, such as the lack of family history data and the need for further research on the optimal screening age. Gastrointestinal specialists emphasize the importance of recognizing and addressing warning signs like bleeding, anemia, and changes in bowel habits, especially for those at higher risk.\n\nIn conclusion, colorectal cancer is increasingly affecting younger demographics, necessitating a reevaluation of screening recommendations and a greater focus on identifying and treating the disease in younger patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The site, found by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local elder Clifford Coulthard, holds significant implications for understanding human settlement in the region. It challenges the conventional timeline, suggesting that humans may have arrived in Australia earlier than previously believed, possibly as early as 55,000 to 60,000 years ago. The shelter contains sophisticated tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, indicating a complex relationship between early humans and Australia's giant animals.\n\nThe excavation uncovered 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, revealing advanced technologies like fire-making, sophisticated stone tools, and the use of ochre. The presence of bone and megafauna remains, like Diprotodon bones, suggests hunting and coexistence. The discovery pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the arid zone and questions the accepted timeframe for the first Australians.\n\nOptical dating techniques, including single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and single-grain TT-OSL, were employed to date the site. The site's stratigraphy and Bayesian age modeling provide a comprehensive chronology, with the oldest known evidence of human settlement in the region. The find also challenges the notion of a delayed colonization of the arid interior, as the Flinders Ranges shelter indicates a rapid expansion of human presence.\n\nThe study, published in Nature, contributes to a reevaluation of Australia's prehistory and the role of Indigenous Australians in the development of key technologies and their interactions with megafauna, potentially shedding light on the debate over the extinction of these large animals.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "This news summary discusses the concept of advanced civilizations expanding and harnessing energy in the universe, as outlined by astrophysicist ideas and recent research. The article begins by explaining the three stages of technological advancement, proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, where civilizations progress from capturing a planet's resources (Type I), to a star's energy (Type II), to a galaxy's resources (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that as civilizations advance, they would inevitably seek to capture energy from distant stars to counteract the expanding universe's isolation. Dark energy-driven expansion threatens to make stars beyond our Local Group inaccessible, necessitating the capture of energy sources.\n\nHooper proposes that advanced civilizations would employ massive structures like Dyson spheres, consisting of solar-powered satellites, to collect and redirect starlight. These structures, inspired by science fiction concepts like Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\" and Freeman Dyson's energy-harvesting models, would surround stars and capture their energy. The presence of Dyson spheres or other mega-structures, such as statites (hovering solar collectors), would indicate the presence of a highly advanced civilization, as seen in science fiction like Larry Niven's \"Ringworld.\"\n\nThe urgency to capture energy from stars stems from the expanding universe's accelerated expansion due to dark energy, which could render stars beyond our Local Group unreachable within the lifetime of the universe. Therefore, civilizations might actively seek to control as many stars as possible before they become inaccessible.\n\nWhile humans are currently in the early stages of technological advancement, the possibility of alien civilizations far more advanced than us, potentially millions of years older, is suggested. These civilizations would have already reached the stage of capturing and utilizing stars for their energy needs. Detecting such advanced civilizations would involve observing unusual light signatures, such as stars being accelerated by energy extraction, or anomalies in the spectra of galaxies with harvested stars.\n\nIn summary, the quest for universal dominance through energy capture has become a key factor in the development of advanced civilizations, with implications for their survival and the search for extraterrestrial life. As humanity continues to explore these concepts, the hunt for signs of such advanced technology could reveal the existence of other intelligent beings in the cosmos.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Oakleigh's left kidney has 22% functionality, and she is scheduled for surgery to correct the reflux and potentially improve her kidney function. The surgery aims to prevent future infections, as Oakleigh has been battling antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas infections, a common but dangerous bacteria.\n\nPseudomonas infections, including the strain Oakleigh contracted, are caused by P. aeruginosa and can affect individuals, particularly those who are weak or immunocompromised. They are challenging to treat due to their resistance to multiple antibiotics. The bacteria can spread through various means, including hospital environments, and pose a significant risk, especially for those with weakened immune systems.\n\nThe second news item discusses pseudomonas infections in general, highlighting their potential severity and ability to cause infections in different parts of the body, including pneumonia and bloodstream infections.

He clashed with the writers over the direction of the show, pushing for a more pointed and purposeful approach, focusing on political satire and deconstructing news stories.\n\nStewart's appointment was met with skepticism from some, but he brought in fresh blood, including head writer Ben Karlin, who shared Stewart's disdain for superficial comedy and a desire for a more aggressive political stance. Key contributors like Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, and D.J.

{"pred": "A series of recent discoveries in the field of paleoanthropology and archaeology challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of early human cultures. Researchers have uncovered evidence suggesting that dramatic shifts in toolmaking and social organization occurred much earlier than previously thought, possibly around 320,000 years ago in East Africa. This shift, marked by the emergence of Middle Stone Age tools and the use of obsidian from distant sources, may have been driven by climate changes that forced early humans to expand their foraging territories and develop trade networks.\n\nThe excavations in Olorgesailie, Kenya, reveal a progression from simpler, locally sourced stone tools to more specialized, Middle Stone Age implements, indicating increased adaptability and innovation. The discovery of obsidian tools, often associated with Homo sapiens or their relatives, suggests long-distance communication and trade, possibly facilitated by the need to secure resources in response to unpredictable food sources due to shifting landscapes.\n\nThe Olorgesailie findings, with their Middle Stone Age tools and the presence of obsidian from afar, imply the existence of trading networks and the potential for complex social structures. While it is uncertain whether Homo sapiens or a related species created these tools, the development of specialized tools and pigment use point to a growing sophistication in behavior.\n\nThese discoveries align with genetic evidence placing the origin of Homo sapiens in Africa and the gradual development of modern human traits. However, climate fluctuations, possibly tied to Homo sapiens' evolution, may have played a significant role in driving these advancements. Researchers speculate that resource scarcity and the need to adapt to changing environments led to the development of more complex tool-making techniques and the establishment of inter-group connections.\n\nThe Olorgesailie findings, along with other sites across Africa, challenge the traditional view of a single \"human revolution\" around 40,000 years ago. Instead, a gradual process of cultural and technological advancement appears to have unfolded over hundreds of thousands of years, with climate change and environmental pressures shaping the development of early humans. As a result, the concept of a \"human revolution\" may need to be redefined, with complex behaviors and innovations emerging much earlier in human history.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR.

Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Despite facing numerous challenges, including Cruz's unstable home life, Hooper took him in and eventually adopted him when he was 12 years old after his biological mother asked her to keep him temporarily. She provided a stable environment, support, and guidance, helping him overcome his academic struggles, change his behavior, and even adopt her last name, Hooper, when he was legally adopted at 30. This act of love and dedication transformed Cruz's life, turning him from a troublesome student to a successful adult with a strong bond to his adoptive family.\n\nThe second passage tells the story of a student-teacher relationship that evolved into a lifelong bond.

The 2006 Military Commissions Act (MCA) revoked habeas corpus rights for certain individuals labeled \"enemy combatants,\" allowing the executive branch to detain suspects outside the traditional court system. Detainees at Guantanamo Bay, particularly those without substantial evidence, have faced indefinite detention and lack of access to fair trials. The Supreme Court's ongoing examination of habeas corpus cases at Guantanamo represents a potential check on executive overreach.\n\nThe second passage reports a significant legal milestone when a New York court granted a writ of habeas corpus to two chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, at Stony Brook University, making them the first animals in U.S. history to receive a habeas corpus order. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP) had initially filed lawsuits arguing that the chimpanzees, held for research purposes, are cognitive beings deserving of liberty. The judge's decision opens the door to a broader legal debate about the rights of animals, with NhRP planning to pursue similar cases involving other animals like elephants, great apes, and cetaceans, arguing that they possess autonomy and should be entitled to bodily liberty.\n\nThese developments emphasize the ongoing struggle to balance executive power, individual rights, and the expanding recognition of legal personhood for non-human entities.

The Lacey Act, amended in 2008, holds that the law applies to both endangered animals and plants, including the木材 seized by the government. Gibson maintains that it has purchased legally sourced wood, pointing to documents supporting its compliance with US and Malagasy laws, while the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson knowingly imported wood linked to illegal timber harvests.\n\nThe EIA's director, Andrea Johnson, asserts that the Lacey Act requires end-users like Gibson to verify the legality of their supply chain, a responsibility Gibson has been accused of neglecting. Gibson denies the allegations, stating that it was considering alternative sources like Madagascar before discontinuing imports in 2009. Chris Martin, CEO of C.F. Martin & Co., supports the Lacey Act, acknowledging the need to stop illegal logging but expressing concerns about the law's retroactivity and potential impact on vintage guitar collectors.\n\nAttorneys representing guitar makers have raised issues about the law's application to past purchases and the difficulty in proving compliance.

{"pred": "Recent studies have shed new light on the water history of Mars, revealing a massive ancient ocean that once covered a significant portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. A team of scientists, using data from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and other observatories, discovered that a large body of water, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once existed on Mars, comparable to the Atlantic Ocean's volume. This ancient ocean, which was up to a mile deep, persisted for millions of years, providing a potentially habitable environment for early Mars.\n\nThe ocean's existence is inferred from the high concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, in the Martian atmosphere. As water evaporated over time, the planet lost a significant amount of water, leaving behind a higher proportion of deuterium. This indicates a substantial water loss, with the potential for a global ocean that could have reached up to 137 meters in depth.\n\nThe ancient ocean extended over about half of the planet's northern hemisphere, suggesting Mars was once a warm and wet environment, similar to Earth's early days. This discovery challenges previous beliefs that Mars was primarily a dry and arid planet, with the possibility of liquid water, rivers, and even long-lasting lakes and seas.\n\nThe presence of methane on Mars, detected by NASA's Curiosity rover, adds to the intrigue, although its origin remains uncertain. While it could be a sign of extant microbial life, it could also be produced by geological processes.\n\nThese findings have implications for the search for life on Mars, as the habitability of the planet in its past is becoming increasingly supported.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The movie, directed by John Requa and Glenn Ficarra, is criticized for its lack of authenticity and depth, despite its glossy presentation and star power. Smith plays Nicky Spurgeon, a seasoned swindler, while Robbie portrays Jess, his protégé, in a story that aims to reveal the secrets of the criminal underworld but instead relies on Smith's charisma to keep the audience engaged.\n\nThe film's plot involves a series of implausible scenes, such as a football stadium con that becomes absurdly exaggerated, and a warehouse operation that seems unrealistic. The script's reliance on coincidences and a convoluted narrative structure leaves viewers unimpressed, with the movie being described as a con itself, attempting to deceive without offering substance.\n\nWhile there are some enjoyable moments, particularly the chemistry between Smith and Robbie, the film's core fails to impress. Despite the initial promise of exploring the criminal underworld, \"Focus\" ultimately disappoints, relying on Smith's charm to entertain rather than engage. The directorial choices and casting decisions, with Smith's performance not quite living up to his potential, contribute to the movie's shortcomings.\n\nMeanwhile, the casting process for the film is mentioned, highlighting the intrigue surrounding the selection of stars like Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck before settling on Smith and rising star Margot Robbie. The film's low-key approach and focus on Will Smith's suave persona, reminiscent of classic Hollywood pairings like Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, create a nostalgic charm that saves the movie from total failure.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Focus\" is a slick but flawed film that tries to captivate with its star power and flashy visuals but ultimately falls flat due to its lack of substance and credibility.

Nestlé had been attempting to trademark the shape of its Kit Kat bar in Europe for over a decade, but the ECJ ruled that the shape alone is not distinctive enough to warrant trademark protection. This decision affects not only Kit Kat but also other similar snacks like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which can now potentially use the shape without fear of infringing on Nestlé's claims. The case highlighted the need for a product to be distinctive in every EU market, not just a significant part, for a trademark to be upheld. The Kit Kat shape may still be protected in some countries, but the ruling sets a precedent for future trademark applications.\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing legal dispute between Nestlé and Mondelez over the Kit Kat shape echoes a broader issue in the chocolate industry, with trademark battles affecting other products like Toblerone's shape and Cadbury's purple wrapper color. These cases have implications for businesses operating within the EU, with potential consequences for branding strategies and intellectual property rights.\n\nThe outcome of the Kit Kat shape case has left the possibility open for Nestlé to reapply with stronger evidence, but for now, the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) will likely reconsider the shape's trademark status based on the court's ruling.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

{"pred": "New research on dinosaur vocalizations challenges the iconic T. rex roar from popular culture, revealing that the sound of the mighty dinosaur may have been quite different from what we're accustomed to seeing in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" Scientists argue that the T. rex, despite its fearsome reputation, likely made sounds more akin to today's birds, with closed-mouth vocalizations that could have resembled the coo of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich. These sounds, produced through an esophageal pouch, were low-frequency and possibly used in defense or mating displays. The study, published in the journal Evolution, suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved at least 16 times in birds and could have been present in some non-avian dinosaurs due to their potential for large body size and the presence of an esophageal pouch.\n\nThe creation of dinosaur sounds in movies, such as the T. rex's roar, relied heavily on creative sound design. For instance, the iconic T. rex roar in \"Jurassic Park\" was a composite of various animal sounds, including a baby elephant's cry, tiger's growl, and an alligator's gargle, creating a cinematic effect rather than a scientifically accurate representation. Velociraptors in the film, on the other hand, featured a goose-like hiss and a tortoise-like mating call, demonstrating the creative liberties taken in crafting dinosaur sounds for cinema.\n\nThe study also highlights the possibility that dinosaurs, like birds, may have had a syrinx, a bird-like vocal organ, and that their calls might have been low-pitched and throaty, similar to the coo of a dove or the mumble of an ostrich. The authors suggest that without vocal cords like mammals, dinosaurs' sounds were likely produced through air sacs and throat vibrations, with some dinosaurs potentially capable of closed-mouth vocalizations.\n\nWhile the fossil record lacks direct evidence of dinosaur vocalizations, the study provides insights into the possibility of dinosaurs communicating in ways that were different from what we've seen in movies. As the field of dinosaur biology continues to evolve, researchers are uncovering surprising aspects of these ancient creatures, including their potential for complex vocalizations that played a role in communication, courtship, or territorial displays. The combination of scientific analysis and creative sound design paints a more nuanced picture of dinosaur vocalizations, inviting further exploration and imagination in the world of prehistoric soundscapes.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

Trey Gowdy, has released a final report that reveals discrepancies between the public statements made by the Obama administration and internal communications during the attack. The report claims that the administration initially tried to downplay the role of terrorism and instead focused on the supposed connection to an anti-Islam video, which was later determined to be a false narrative. The report highlights a concern expressed by State Department officials during the attack that Marines' uniforms might hinder diplomacy, leading to discussions about the possibility of them wearing civilian clothing. However, despite the military not deploying to Benghazi, the report accuses the administration of providing a false account of the attack, particularly regarding the cause and motivation.\n\nThe report also disputes the claim that the attack was a spontaneous protest over a video, stating that it was a well-planned terrorist operation. The controversy surrounding the administration's handling of the situation, including the contradictory public statements, has been a key focus of the investigation. The report suggests that the administration knew from the beginning that the attack in Benghazi was not a protest but a terrorist act, but intentionally misled the public about the video's role in sparking the violence.\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, criticized the committee's chairman, Trey Gowdy, for what he perceives as attempts to limit transparency and accountability, accusing him of attempting to prevent a full examination of the facts. Cummings argues that the report does not fundamentally change the public's understanding of the attack, but adds detail without altering the core facts.\n\nThe report includes new details about the administration's internal deliberations, revealing a disconnect between the public narrative and the private communications. It concludes that Hillary Clinton and her team did not adequately address the growing extremism in Libya and misled the public by blaming the violence on the video, even after receiving intelligence suggesting a terrorist attack.\n\nIn summary, the Benghazi Select Committee's final report exposes a pattern of misleading statements and a lack of preparedness, with the administration initially attempting to deflect blame onto a video, while privately acknowledging the terrorist nature of the attack.

Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

Rates are particularly high in the Middle East and North Africa, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait showing the highest obesity rates for women, while Bahrain, Kuwait, and the US lead for men. The obesity rate is also alarming in children, with a 47% increase observed during the study period.\n\nDespite the US having the highest absolute number of obese individuals, obesity is not unique to this country. In fact, obesity rates are equally concerning in other nations, with no country witnessing a decline in obesity rates over the past three decades. The situation is particularly concerning as obesity coexists with hunger in many parts of the world. Factors contributing to obesity include increased caloric intake, changes in diet, reduced physical activity, and shifts in gut bacteria. The Lancet study highlights that obesity rates are rising globally, affecting both developed and developing countries, with women and children being affected as well.\n\nThe report suggests that obesity is a result of the affordability and accessibility of unhealthy, high-calorie foods, which are often cheaper than healthier options. The situation is further complicated by the simultaneous rise in income and obesity, indicating a link between the two. Efforts to combat obesity are lacking, with no clear success stories to date. The World Health Organization has acknowledged the need to address the growing problem of childhood obesity, with a commission set to release findings in 2015.\n\nIn conclusion, obesity is a pressing issue worldwide, affecting a significant portion of the global population, regardless of income levels, and calls for urgent global action to address this escalating health crisis.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns. The 188-country study found that there are 2.1 billion overweight or obese people in the world, making up around 30% of the world's population, up from 20% in 1980, USA Today reports.

Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

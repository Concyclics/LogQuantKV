{"pred": "Recent research has revealed a concerning connection between cigarette smoke and the persistence and virulence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke increases MRSA's resistance to antibiotics and impairs the effectiveness of the immune system in combating the bacteria. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes more adherent to human cells and develops a higher tolerance to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it harder to kill.\n\nIn a study published in Infection and Immunity, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander and her team observed that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extracts exhibited enhanced resistance, with some strains becoming four times more difficult to eliminate by macrophages, the body's first line of defense against infections. The bacteria's cell walls were altered, allowing it to withstand the immune system's defenses. Similar findings were reported for e-cigarette smoke, although the resistance increase was more pronounced in MRSA exposed to traditional cigarette smoke.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke not only poses health risks to smokers but also acts as a catalyst for the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The heightened resistance can persist for hours after exposure, potentially facilitating the spread of MRSA in hospital settings and among smokers. The research highlights the need for further understanding of the interplay between environmental factors and bacterial behavior, emphasizing the importance of quitting smoking to reduce the risk of infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nThese studies contribute to the growing body of evidence linking cigarette smoke to detrimental effects on both human health and the persistence of infectious agents, reinforcing the need for public health interventions to discourage smoking and promote healthier environments to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant infections.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a viral illness, such as enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), though the exact cause remains uncertain.\n\nIn 2014, there was a surge in AFM cases, with 120 confirmed in the US, leading to concerns about a potential repeat of the 2014 outbreak. While EV-D68 was initially suspected, no definitive link has been established. This year, EV-D68 has not been conclusively tied to the increase in cases, but some doctors suspect a connection.\n\nThe condition presents with symptoms like fever, respiratory issues, and rapidly progressing paralysis, often affecting limbs and requiring hospitalization. Treatment options are limited, with physical therapy and experimental treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and possibly Prozac being discussed. Recovery rates for children vary, with partial recovery in most cases but only a minority fully recovering.\n\nParents and healthcare professionals are alarmed by the rising number of cases, with at least four states reporting multiple cases, including California, Massachusetts, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia. The CDC is urging vigilance and monitoring for enterovirus outbreaks, as seen in 2014, but no widespread EV-D68 has been confirmed this year.\n\nThe rarity of AFM, with only a few dozen cases annually, makes it challenging to determine the cause. Parents, like Robin Roberts whose son Carter was diagnosed, are frustrated by the lack of knowledge about the condition. The condition's sudden onset and its potential link to enteroviruses highlight the need for more research and understanding to prevent or treat this mysterious illness.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the CDC is emphasizing the importance of hygiene to prevent the spread of any potential triggers, while researchers like Dr. Max Wiznitzer are studying animal models to identify potential causes and treatments.

Their study found that the bloodstains do not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion scenario, such as the angle and consistency of blood flow, particularly on the forearm, hand, and spear wound. The researchers concluded that the stains are inconsistent with a standing or hanging person, suggesting they were imprinted on the cloth using a different method, possibly a standing model or an artistic representation from the 14th century.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin, housed in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, has long been a subject of debate due to its age, radiocarbon dating placing it between 1260 and 1390 CE, and the image of a crucified man. While the shroud's authenticity remains uncertain, the forensic analysis casts doubt on its historical significance, supporting the theory that it may be a medieval creation rather than a genuine relic.\n\nThe study's findings challenge the traditional interpretation of the shroud, which has been a focal point for religious and scientific curiosity for centuries. The researchers' meticulous examination of blood flow patterns, using both real and synthetic blood, did not align with the expected patterns for a crucifixion, further fueling the debate about its authenticity.\n\nWhile the investigation does not definitively prove the shroud's inauthenticity, it adds weight to the argument that the image on the cloth is more likely a product of artistic interpretation or a 'didactic' representation from the 14th century.

The trail's fragile ecosystem, particularly in desert regions, is at risk from the growing number of hikers, prompting discussions about environmental impact, rescue operations, and the need for responsible hiking practices.\n\nThe release of \"Wild\" has inspired many, with the book selling well and the film attracting a larger audience. The Latin phrase \"solvitur ambulando\" (translated as \"it is solved by walking\") reflects the belief that a challenging hike can provide life-changing experiences. However, the sudden surge in popularity has raised concerns about inexperienced hikers embarking on the trail without adequate preparation, potentially endangering themselves and the environment.\n\nThe Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) has implemented a permit system with a daily cap of 50 permits to manage the increasing numbers and minimize trail impact.

Named after the Mandarin words for \"rainbow\" and \"big crest,\" the dinosaur had vibrant feathers, particularly on its head, neck, and chest, which displayed colors similar to hummingbirds. The feathers, analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, revealed melanosomes, the pigment-producing structures, suggesting a rainbow-like appearance. Caihong had a mix of dinosaur and bird-like features, with a crested head, Velociraptor-like skull, and bird-like feathers, including asymmetrical feathers on the tail, which may have been involved in aerodynamic flight. The dinosaur's plumage also included both simple and complex structures, hinting at the evolution of display and possibly even flight-related functions.\n\nThe dinosaur's fossil, with its well-preserved feathers, provides insights into the colorful world of prehistoric creatures. While it had a predominantly black body, the head and tail featured iridescent hues, making it the earliest known dinosaur with asymmetric feathers, a trait later associated with flight. Caihong's dinosaurian characteristics contrasted with its bird-like feathers, suggesting a complex and diverse feather usage in its lineage.\n\nThe discovery challenges our understanding of dinosaur plumage and the role of coloration in communication and display. The presence of feathers on the dinosaur's head and chest, as well as its relatively short but iridescent tail, raises questions about the dinosaur's possible social behaviors and the origins of avian traits. With the fossil's extraordinary preservation, researchers speculate that the dinosaur may have used its colorful feathers for attracting mates or enhancing visibility in the forest canopy.\n\nOverall, the find pushes the boundaries of what was previously known about dinosaur appearances and behavior, offering a glimpse into a more colorful and potentially more avian-like world during the Jurassic period. Further study of Caihong and other similarly preserved fossils could shed light on the evolution of feather diversity and the development of ornamental displays in the early stages of avian evolution.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

However, the tax faced significant opposition due to its regressive nature, with critics arguing that it led to price hikes, loss of revenue, and migration of customers to neighboring areas. Retail giants like Costco adjusted their pricing strategies, with some stores outside the city avoiding the tax. The tax exempted beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, causing Starbucks to refuse the tax. Seattle's tax sparked debates about its effectiveness and fairness, with opponents pointing to the tax's potential to harm local businesses and unite diverse groups against it.\n\nSimultaneously, a similar tax in Cook County, Illinois, was repealed within months due to public backlash and financial challenges. The tax, initially imposed by Seattle and later in Chicago, faced criticism for its complexity, lack of consistency, and unintended consequences, such as reduced sales and potential shifts in consumer behavior.\n\nIn Spokane, Washington, a soda tax was introduced, mirroring Seattle's attempt, but faced skepticism from consumers and retailers. The tax led to price hikes and prompted shoppers to seek alternatives outside the city, undermining the tax's original goals.\n\nOverall, these soda taxes highlight the challenges in implementing such policies, as they struggle to balance public health objectives with economic impacts and public opinion.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Unlike Target, which suffered a larger-scale breach affecting 40 million customers, Neiman Marcus did not provide an estimate of the number of stolen credit card numbers or affected customers. The breach at Neiman Marcus is believed to be unrelated to Target's breach, which saw 40 million card numbers and possibly more personal information stolen.\n\nTarget's breach, investigated by computer firm iSight, was caused by malware placed in point-of-sale systems, allowing hackers to access credit card data during the transaction process. The malware was sophisticated and employed tactics unseen in eCrime, making it difficult to detect. The report suggests that the Target breach was part of a broader international hacking campaign targeting multiple retailers.\n\nBoth breaches, including Target's, are currently under joint investigation by state attorneys general. Neiman Marcus has offered one year of free credit monitoring to affected customers.

This shift, evident in a study examining over 258,000 patients between 1998 and 2011, highlights the need for reevaluating screening guidelines. Younger patients tend to present with more advanced cancers, requiring more aggressive treatments like surgery (72% vs. 63% for those under 50) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%). Despite this, younger patients with localized cancer have slightly better survival rates, suggesting that early detection remains crucial.\n\nThe study calls for improved risk assessment and earlier screening for younger adults, as the current recommendation of age 50 might miss a significant portion of cases. While colorectal cancer was traditionally associated with aging, the increasing number of cases in younger patients prompts a wake-up call for healthcare providers to consider symptoms in this demographic. Some experts suggest that family history and high-risk factors may warrant earlier screenings, even without definitive guidelines.\n\nThe rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger adults challenges the notion that the disease is solely an issue for the elderly.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The site, found by chance when a colleague needed a toilet break, holds significant implications for understanding the early settlement of Australia. The shelter contains sophisticated tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, suggesting a level of technological advancement and coexistence with large animals like the extinct giant wombat and a giant bird. The presence of human activity, including fire-making and the use of sophisticated tools, pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the region by around 10,000 years, challenging the conventional belief that the first Australians arrived around 50,000 years ago.\n\nExcavations at the site uncovered 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, providing insights into the development of stone tools, bone technology, and the use of ochre. The discovery of artefacts and bone fragments from the extinct Diprotodon supports the theory of human-megafauna interaction, potentially indicating hunting or scavenging. The presence of megafauna bones suggests that humans were not only present but actively engaged with the environment.\n\nRadiocarbon dating of charcoal and eggshell fragments, as well as optical dating techniques, have been employed to establish a chronology for the site. The findings, published in Nature, contribute to a reevaluation of the timeline for human settlement in the arid regions of Australia and challenge the notion of a delayed colonization. The discovery also underscores the innovation and adaptability of early Australians, as evidenced by the development of local technologies.\n\nThe site's significance extends beyond its age, as it questions the role of humans in the extinction of megafauna, with some experts arguing that interactions between humans and these large animals might have played a role. The presence of megafauna remains and artefacts in the same context adds weight to the debate on the cause of megafauna extinction.\n\nThe discovery has been hailed as a major archaeological breakthrough, rewriting the narrative about the complexity and sophistication of early human societies in Australia.

To achieve this, they would potentially construct massive Dyson spheres or swarms of solar-powered satellites, like Stapledon's \"star makers,\" to capture and harness star energy.\n\nAs civilizations progress to Type III, they would need to capture stars to prevent them from becoming inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of the universe driven by dark energy.

Initially, Oakleigh, born at 3 pounds, fought her way to recovery and appeared healthy until she developed a sudden fever, leading to a diagnosis of severe kidney reflux and a subsequent Pseudomonas infection. This infection, caused by the antibiotic-resistant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is particularly concerning due to its potential to cause serious complications, including kidney and heart issues.\n\nPseudomonas infections are difficult to treat because of their resistance to multiple antibiotics. Oakleigh's case highlights the risk for these infections in vulnerable individuals, especially those with weakened immune systems or medical conditions. After battling kidney issues and infections, Oakleigh is scheduled for surgery to correct her kidney reflux in hopes of preventing future infections. She also faces a moderate ASD and pulmonary stenosis, which require further evaluation.\n\nThe second passage provides general information about Pseudomonas infections, explaining that they can affect anyone but pose a significant threat to immunocompromised individuals. Symptoms range from minor skin infections to life-threatening pneumonia, and the bacteria's resistance to antibiotics complicates treatment.\n\nIn the third news item, Oakleigh's family recounts her journey, starting with her premature birth and subsequent NICU stay. After a brief period of apparent recovery, Oakleigh contracted a critical E. coli infection resistant to antibiotics due to her previous exposure. The family is now grappling with the severity of the infection, which can potentially spread to the brain and spinal cord. Despite the challenges, Oakleigh's family remains hopeful and is seeking financial assistance through a GoFundMe campaign to cover medical expenses for her upcoming kidney surgery and ongoing care.\n\nOverall, the news revolves around the health struggles of Oakleigh Nance, a young infant battling kidney issues, infections, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The family's fight to save her life underscores the importance of antibiotics and the risks associated with superbugs, while also highlighting the emotional support they receive from the community.", "answers": ["An Oklahoma girl diagnosed with \"super\" E. coli is facing a life-or-death battle—and worse, she's only 11 months old. \"With this strain of E. coli, it can get in her brain, it can get in her spinal cord, basically cause her to go into cardiac arrest,\" her grandfather, Chris Curtis, tells KFOR. \"And we heard that it was a very, very scary situation.\" Her family says it's not clear how Oakleigh Nance got the infection, which appears resistant to antibiotics, but the CDC is investigating.

{"pred": "A series of groundbreaking discoveries in the field of paleoanthropology challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors. Researchers, using evidence from Olorgesailie, Kenya, have found that dramatic shifts in East African climate around 320,000 years ago may have driven advancements in toolmaking and the emergence of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. Middle Stone Age tools, dated as old as 320,000 years, suggest a transition from simpler, locally sourced tools to more specialized, obsidian-based implements, indicating increased mobility and trade. These changes coincided with climate fluctuations that forced early humans to adapt by expanding their foraging territories and possibly engaging in long-distance interactions.\n\nThe discovery of obsidian tools, often associated with Homo sapiens, implies the existence of trading networks and social connections among hominid populations. The Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age tools, with their specialized designs and imported raw materials, suggest advanced planning and collaboration. The study also connects these developments to the rise of Homo sapiens, potentially indicating that climate-driven behavioral changes played a crucial role in shaping the cognitive abilities and social structures of early humans.\n\nWhile the exact timeline and species responsible for these innovations remain uncertain, the research provides insights into the complex interplay between environmental shifts, technological advancements, and social organization. The findings challenge previous assumptions about a single \"human revolution\" and emphasize the gradual evolution of modern behaviors in Africa, predating the arrival of Homo sapiens in the region. As climate change forced early humans to adapt and innovate, it appears that the roots of modern human traits, such as long-distance communication and resource management, were established much earlier than previously thought.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

This unprecedented decision recognizes the animals as legal persons, potentially paving the way for discussions about the rights of non-human primates and other cognitively complex animals. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP), which filed the lawsuit, argues that the chimps' confinement violates their liberty and calls for their release to a sanctuary.\n\nThe ruling comes amidst a broader debate over habeas corpus, a legal principle that ensures individuals are not held indefinitely without due process. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 temporarily revoked habeas corpus rights for certain individuals labeled \"enemy combatants,\" including legal residents and non-citizens at Guantanamo Bay. The Supreme Court is set to review the detainees' cases, potentially reasserting the importance of habeas corpus as a safeguard against arbitrary detention.\n\nThe case involving Hercules and Leo represents a milestone in the animal rights movement, as it challenges the traditional boundaries between humans and animals in legal proceedings.

The act was enacted to combat illegal wildlife trafficking, including plants like the ebony and rosewood used in Gibson's instruments. Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims the company has been compliant with legal procedures, stating that they sourced wood legally and stopped imports from Madagascar after a coup there. However, the Environmental Investigation Agency's Andrea Johnson alleges that Gibson knowingly imported wood linked to illegal harvests, citing emails suggesting the company took steps to maintain a supply chain potentially tied to such activities.\n\nThe situation has raised concerns among other guitar manufacturers, with some, like Chris Martin of C.F. Martin Guitar, supporting the Lacey Act as a means to curb illegal logging, while others criticize its retroactivity and potential impact on vintage instrument collectors. The case against Gibson remains unresolved, with the company arguing that they have not been formally charged and that their business has suffered due to the raids. The government's enforcement of the Lacey Act, which includes the trade of vintage instruments, has led to increased scrutiny and caution in the industry, with some dealers like George Gruhn adapting their business practices accordingly.

{"pred": "Recent discoveries shed new light on the water history of Mars, suggesting that the planet once had a massive and extensive watery past. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around five times the size of the Atlantic Ocean, covered nearly half of Mars' northern hemisphere 4 billion years ago, according to NASA scientists. This ancient ocean, up to a mile deep, was formed by an enormous amount of water, enough to create a global ocean reaching 137 meters in depth. The water contained a significant amount of heavy water, indicating substantial water loss over time.\n\nThe ocean's existence supports the theory that Mars was a warm and wet planet during its early days, with flowing rivers, lakes, and possibly even seas. This contrasts with previous beliefs that water on Mars was less prevalent. The water loss, primarily due to the thinning Martian atmosphere, led to the depletion of the planet's water reserves, leaving only the polar ice caps as remnants.\n\nThe study, involving observations from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and other facilities, relied on mapping the distribution of deuterium, a heavier form of hydrogen, in the Martian atmosphere. The high concentration of deuterium suggests that Mars lost a vast amount of water, equivalent to more than six times the current polar ice caps. This finding strengthens the case for the possibility of habitability and the potential for early Martian life.\n\nThe discovery of methane in the Martian atmosphere, although not necessarily implying life, adds to the intrigue about the planet's past conditions. As research continues, the search for signs of life on Mars, including the upcoming Exomars mission, will focus on the possibility of past or present habitability, given the planet's曾经有过 extensive water resources.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Nestlé had been attempting to trademark the shape since 2002, arguing that it was distinctive enough to be protected. However, the court ruled that a previous decision to annul the trademark was correct, effectively ending Nestlé's attempt to exclusively control the shape. This decision affects not only Kit Kat but also competitors like Cadbury's Kvikk Lunsj, a Norwegian snack with a similar design, and opens up the possibility of generic four-fingered wafer snacks in the market.\n\nThe case highlights the complexity of trademark laws, with the ECJ requiring proof of distinctiveness across all EU member states, not just a significant part. The Kit Kat shape has been a subject of legal battles for over a decade, with Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, opposing Nestlé's claims. The ruling could lead to a re-evaluation of the Kit Kat shape's trademark status, potentially removing it from protected status in the EU.\n\nAdditionally, the case has broader implications for other brands, such as Toblerone, whose shape is also trademarked, and the ongoing disputes over colors like Cadbury's purple wrapper and gold Easter bunnies. These legal battles reflect the challenges faced by multinational companies in protecting their intellectual property in a single market with varying national regulations.

The study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzes the vocalizations of living birds and their dinosaur ancestors, proposing that a bird-like esophageal pouch system enabled dinosaurs to produce low-frequency, throaty sounds.\n\nThe researchers found that closed-mouth vocalizations, characteristic of ostriches and doves, evolved independently in 16 different lineages, including birds and crocodiles, indicating that this trait could have been present in some dinosaur species. The study also reveals that the iconic T. rex sound effects in \"Jurassic Park\" were created using a combination of animal noises, such as a baby elephant's cry, tiger's growl, and an alligator's gurgle, mixed to create a cinematic effect.\n\nIn the Jurassic franchise, the velociraptors' hissing and the T. rex's roar were not entirely accurate. Velociraptors' sounds were influenced by a goose's hiss, while the T. rex's roar was a composite of baby elephant, tiger, and alligator sounds. The study highlights the lack of fossil evidence for dinosaur vocal cords, leaving much speculation about their actual vocalizations.\n\nThe research suggests that dinosaurs may have communicated with low-pitched, bird-like sounds, potentially similar to coos or hoots, which could have been used in mating displays or territorial calls. The study underscores the mystery surrounding dinosaur sounds, as only a fraction of dinosaur genera have been discovered, leaving room for much speculation and future discoveries.\n\nThe Jurassic Park sound designer, Gary Rydstrom, shared the creative process behind the movie's dinosaur sounds, using animal recordings like tortoises, geese, and even a Jack Russell terrier for various dinosaur noises. The iconic T. rex roar was derived from a baby elephant, while the raptors' communication involved a mix of mating tortoises and goose vocalizations.\n\nIn conclusion, while dinosaurs may have had a more complex vocal repertoire than previously imagined, with some resembling bird-like coos or hoots, the definitive sounds remain a mystery due to the lack of fossil evidence.

Bayesian methods, which update probabilities with new information, initially suggested an equal likelihood across a wide area, but the shifting focus on a deliberate diversion has increased the probability of the plane being farther from Kuala Lumpur. Bayesian calculations help weigh various scenarios, considering factors like the probability of the plane being intact, the likelihood of a deliberate act, and the probability of finding wreckage based on past experiences.\n\nStatisticians, like those who helped locate the Air France Flight 447 wreckage, use Bayesian techniques to analyze data, update probabilities, and account for overlapping information. They consider factors like beacon functionality, damage probability, and expert judgment to create a probability distribution for the search area. However, the complex nature of the Malaysia Airlines case has led some experts to question the suitability of Bayesian methods when new evidence significantly alters the initial assumptions.\n\nWhile Bayesian methods have been successful in past searches, like Air France Flight 447, others argue that they may not be ideal for the current search due to the dramatic change in circumstances. Some statisticians suggest that the search should remain open to all possibilities and update probabilities as new information emerges, even if it means acknowledging uncertainty and the potential for the plane to be in remote or hard-to-reach areas.\n\nThe search for Flight 370 has also faced challenges in coordinating information and maintaining accurate records of previous search areas.

The report highlights a concern among State Department officials during the attack that Marines' uniforms might hinder diplomacy, leading to discussions about the possibility of them wearing civilian clothing. The committee found that the Obama administration initially blamed the attack on an anti-Islam video, which was later contradicted by evidence suggesting it was a well-planned terrorist act, possibly linked to al-Qaeda affiliates. \n\nThe report exposes discrepancies between the public statements and private communications of top administration officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who initially portrayed the attack as a response to a protest over an anti-Muslim video, despite knowing that it was a terrorist act. The report also accuses the committee of attempting to shift blame to the video, even as witnesses and intelligence assessments pointed to a terrorist attack. \n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, criticized the committee's chairman, Trey Gowdy, for what he perceives as a lack of transparency and attempts to avoid accountability. Cummings argues that the report does not significantly alter the public's understanding of the attack, stating that the facts remain consistent: there was no stand-down order, no attempt to politicize the situation, and no evidence of gun trading.

Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report.

A source tells UK magazine Look the actor sent Holmes an \"emotional letter\" looking to, at the very least, be friends again, Australia's News Network reports. \"It's like he's finally recognized that Katie will always be the love of his life,\" the source says. Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one.

{"pred": "Billionaire couple Barry and Honey Sherman, founders of the Canadian pharmaceutical company Apotex, were found dead in their Toronto mansion under suspicious circumstances. The police initially classified the deaths as \"suspicious\" but not a homicide, though later the homicide squad took over the investigation. The cause of death was determined to be ligature neck compression, suggesting strangulation. The couple's children denied the initial media reports suggesting a murder-suicide, stating their parents' lives were consistent with their love for each other and their community. Friends described Barry as a workaholic and Honey as a philanthropist who enjoyed socializing. The couple had recently celebrated their annual trip to Florida, with Honey's email indicating plans for their vacation. Their deaths have left friends and colleagues in shock, with Toronto Mayor John Tory and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressing condolences.

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country held its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to lead, followed by the more conservative Nour party. The elections, held amidst ongoing trials of former President Hosni Mubarak, who was accused of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression, have raised concerns about the balance of power between the military, the Brotherhood, and other opposition groups. The military-controlled government faces criticism for the lack of clarity on the role of the new parliament and the transition to civilian rule. Economic challenges, including a decline in foreign currency reserves and a struggling stock market, loom as the country adjusts to post-Mubarak governance.\n\nThe trial of Mubarak and his sons continued, with the prosecution accusing them of corruption and ordering the use of force against protesters. The court heard calls for a \"harshest penalty\" against Mubarak. Analysts predict that the Brotherhood's strong performance in the elections could lead to either a coalition government or an Islamist-dominated parliament, potentially limiting the influence of other political groups.\n\nThe military's control over the transition remains a point of contention, with the new parliament expected to convene on January 23, just days before the one-year anniversary of Mubarak's ousting. The outcome of the elections and the Mubarak trial will shape the political landscape, with the possibility of a power struggle between the military, Brotherhood, and other opposition factions.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

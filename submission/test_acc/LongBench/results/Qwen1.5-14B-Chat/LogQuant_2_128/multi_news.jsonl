Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the virulence of MRSA, making it more difficult to kill. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes resistant to reactive oxygen species produced by the immune system, as well as antimicrobial peptides that help destroy bacteria. The bacteria adapt by altering their cell walls, allowing them to survive and even adhere better to human cells, enhancing their ability to invade.\n\nIn a study published in Infection and Immunity, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander and her team found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing and exhibited increased resistance to antimicrobial peptides. The effects persisted even after the initial exposure, potentially allowing the bacteria to multiply and cause more severe infections in smokers. Similar findings were observed with e-cigarette smoke, although the resistance enhancement was less pronounced compared to traditional cigarette smoke.\n\nThese findings highlight the double-edged impact of smoking on human health, as it not only poses risks to smokers themselves but also aids in the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from the previous year's count. The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a viral illness, such as enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), which was implicated in the 2014 outbreak but not in the current surge.\n\nAFM cases have been reported in 17 states, with some physicians observing a pattern similar to the 2014 outbreak. While the cause remains uncertain, the CDC is investigating whether enteroviruses, particularly EV-D68, might be a contributing factor. Treatment options are limited, with no definitive cure, and recovery rates vary, with only a minority of children fully recovering. The condition is particularly concerning due to its rapid onset and the potential for long-term paralysis.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak saw 120 cases, and while the 2016 numbers are higher, experts caution that more data is needed to determine if this is a sustained increase or just heightened reporting. Some doctors have reported using intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Prozac as potential treatments, but more research is needed.\n\nParents and healthcare professionals are alarmed by the rising cases, with some fearing a repeat of the 2014 outbreak. The CDC is urging vigilance and increased reporting to monitor the situation. The condition is particularly devastating, affecting children like 3-year-old Carter Roberts and 6-year-old McKenzie Anderson, who lost control of their limbs after contracting the mysterious illness.\n\nAs the cause remains elusive, the CDC is emphasizing the importance of hand hygiene and vaccination to prevent potential spread of enteroviruses.

Spacey initially apologized and came out as gay in response to Rapp's allegations, but his statement did not address the severity of the claims. The House of Cards actor was subsequently fired from the show and his role in the film \"All the Money in the World\" has been recast due to the ongoing scandal.

Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

These loans, often with short-term durations, can cover various expenses like electricity bills, car repairs, and education costs but come with interest rates and fees. It emphasizes the importance of planning and saving, especially with predatory lenders offering higher amounts with increased interest.\n\nThe second part of the summary focuses on payday loans, including both paperless and installment options. Quick cash loans, even for those with poor credit history, are available, but borrowers should be aware of the potential high-interest rates. Installment loans provide a longer repayment period, making them more manageable but still carrying interest charges.\n\nThe third segment discusses the appeal of small, short-term loans with limits typically between £80 and £1,500, ideal for temporary needs. These loans are accessible online and are designed for applicants who meet basic eligibility criteria, such as being a UK resident, employed, and having a recent bank account.\n\nLastly, the passage on no credit check loans highlights the convenience of applying online, with minimal requirements, making them an option for those needing immediate funds.

Named after the Mandarin words for \"rainbow\" and \"big crest,\" the dinosaur had vibrant feathers, particularly on its head, neck, and chest, which displayed colors similar to hummingbirds. The feathers, analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, revealed melanosomes, indicating the dinosaur's plumage was likely black with iridescence. Caihong had a mix of dinosaur and bird-like characteristics, such as crested head, sharp teeth, and possibly bird-like feathers for flight, though its ability to fly is debated. It had a small, possibly flightless body, with a short tail and a long, iridescent frond-shaped tail for display, resembling the feathers of Archaeopteryx.\n\nThe dinosaur's unique features include a crested head, a long snout, and a combination of bird-like and more primitive traits. It had a relatively short, robust dentary and a distinct arrangement of feathers, with asymmetrical tail feathers suggesting a possible connection to the evolution of flight. The discovery challenges our understanding of dinosaur coloration and showcases a more colorful Jurassic world than previously thought.\n\nCaihong's feathers were not evenly distributed, with some regions having long, linear feathers, while others had short, sinuous ones.

The tax exempted beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, causing Starbucks to refuse the tax. Seattle's neighboring Cook County repealed its soda tax within months due to public backlash and declining sales. Similar to Seattle, the tax in Chicago led to a decrease in sales and prompted retailers to adjust prices accordingly.\n\nCostco, a major retailer, felt the impact of the tax, with prices doubling for some products. The tax prompted debates about its fairness, with opponents pointing out that it disproportionately affected low-income households and united diverse groups against it.

During an interview, Cohen repeatedly asked, \"Says who?\" in response to claims about Trump's low poll numbers, suggesting that the campaign was not acknowledging the issue.\n\nThe interview took place amidst a significant shake-up within Trump's campaign team, with the addition of Steve Bannon as campaign chief executive and Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager. Cohen defended the changes, stating that they were strategic moves, not a shake-up, and praised Conway for her understanding of data. Despite the changes, Cohen's response to the polls fueled a humorous meme on social media, with users jokingly repeating \"Says who?\" in response to his denial of the campaign's struggles.\n\nThe interview highlighted the tension within the campaign, as Cohen's dismissive attitude towards poll numbers suggested a lack of transparency about the candidate's standing.

Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

{"pred": "A recent analysis of colorectal cancer data from the University of Michigan has revealed a concerning trend: one in every seven colorectal cancer cases now affects individuals under the age of 50, challenging the traditional belief that the disease predominantly affects older adults. This shift, evident in a study of over 258,000 patients, highlights the need for reevaluating screening guidelines, as younger patients tend to present with more advanced disease and require different treatment approaches. Younger patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer are more likely to undergo aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy, and have slightly better survival rates despite having more advanced disease at diagnosis.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of being vigilant for colorectal cancer symptoms in younger adults, as they are at a higher risk than previously believed. While colorectal cancer was traditionally associated with older age, the findings prompt a call for earlier screening, potentially starting at age 40 or younger for those with family history or increased risk factors. However, experts caution that more research is needed to determine if earlier screening would be beneficial, as the benefits may be limited due to lower cancer prevalence in younger populations.\n\nThe study also highlights the need to address the issue of symptom awareness, as younger patients may present with less noticeable symptoms, leading to delayed diagnosis. Gastrointestinal specialists emphasize the importance of recognizing warning signs like anemia, unusual bowel movements, and dark blood in stool, which should prompt timely evaluation.\n\nIn conclusion, the growing number of colorectal cancer cases in younger adults challenges existing screening recommendations and calls for a reassessment of guidelines to ensure early detection and appropriate care for this younger demographic.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The site, found during a routine toilet stop by an archaeologist and an aboriginal elder, holds significant implications for understanding the early settlement of Australia. The presence of sophisticated tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna suggest advanced human activity, challenging the conventional timeline of human settlement in the region.\n\nThe excavation, involving hand excavation and careful stratigraphic analysis, uncovered approximately 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments. The presence of fireplaces, ochre, and bone tools indicates a complex lifestyle. Optical dating techniques, including single-grain optically stimulated luminescence and single-grain TT-OSL dating, were employed to establish the age of the artefacts, revealing a minimum age of 49,000 years. This pushes back the arrival of humans in the region and suggests earlier colonization than previously believed.\n\nThe site also provides insights into human-megafauna interactions, with evidence of bone and megafauna remains indicating hunting and possibly coexistence. The discovery of ochre use and bone tools challenges the notion of a uniform migration pattern, showing local technological advancements. The find supports the theory that humans could have reached the arid interior earlier than previously thought, potentially around 50,000 to 60,000 years ago.\n\nThe site's significance extends beyond its age, as it questions the role of humans in the extinction of megafauna, with Diprotodon bone fragments suggesting close encounters.

{"pred": "This summary highlights the concept of galactic-scale energy acquisition and the search for advanced civilizations in the universe, as outlined in recent scientific papers and popular science discussions. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev's three-step model of technological advancement, known as the Kardashev Scale, suggests civilizations progress from gathering planetary resources (Type I), to harnessing star energy (Type II), to controlling entire galaxies (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, argues that as civilizations advance, they would inevitably seek to capture energy from distant stars due to the expanding universe's isolation caused by dark energy. This would involve constructing massive structures like Dyson spheres or swarms of solar-powered satellites, such as Stapledon's \"star light-traps\" or Dyson's proposed energy-harvesting satellites.\n\nHooper proposes that advanced civilizations would prioritize securing energy from distant stars before they become inaccessible due to the cosmic horizon. Detecting these civilizations could involve observing unusual light signatures, such as stars being accelerated by energy extraction or galaxies with missing prime stars, which would indicate the presence of star-harvesting technology. While humanity is currently at a relatively early stage, with Earth estimated to be around a 0.7 on Kardashev's scale, the possibility of ancient extraterrestrial civilizations with Type II or III status is discussed, operating on a grand scale with structures like Dyson spheres or statites.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures, like the ones imagined by science fiction authors, remains speculative but serves as a key indicator of a civilization's technological prowess.

But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Federal marshals visited Gibson facilities in Tennessee, seizing wood in a move related to the enforcement of the Lacey Act, an endangered species law amended in 2008 to include plants like ebony and rosewood. The government claims that Gibson took steps to maintain a supply chain potentially linked to illegal timber harvests, as evidenced by emails cited in a court motion. Gibson denies these allegations, stating that all purchases from Madagascar were legal and that they stopped importing wood from the country after 2009. The company asserts that it has been unfairly targeted without formal charges.\n\nThe case highlights the intersection of music and environmental regulation, as Gibson, a prominent instrument maker, faces potential legal action over its wood sourcing practices. The Lacey Act requires end-users of endangered wood to verify the legality of their supply chain, leading to concerns among guitar makers and collectors about the retroactive nature of the law. Some, like Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., support the act to combat illegal logging, while others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, express worry about the potential for past transactions to be scrutinized.\n\nThe raid on Gibson has also affected the broader industry, with concerns about the impact on vintage guitar trade and the need for clear guidelines on compliance. The Environmental Investigation Agency's Andrea Johnson defends the Lacey Act, arguing that it aims to reduce illegal logging and promote responsible sourcing, even if it causes temporary inconvenience for businesses like Gibson and others in the guitar world.

{"pred": "Recent studies have shed new light on the water history of Mars, revealing a massive ancient ocean that once covered a significant portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. A team of NASA scientists, collaborating with the European Southern Observatory, analyzed data from powerful infrared telescopes to map the distribution of water and its isotopes on Mars. These maps indicate the presence of a large ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, which was at least 137 meters deep and covered about half of Mars' northern hemisphere. This body of water, similar in scale to the Atlantic Ocean on Earth, suggests a warmer and wetter Mars in its early days, with flowing rivers, lakes, and possibly even seas.\n\nThe ocean's existence supports the theory that Mars was habitable, potentially allowing for the evolution of life. The water loss on Mars, primarily due to the thinning atmosphere, led to the formation of a global ocean that eventually receded, leaving behind the polar ice caps as the planet's remaining water source. The presence of deuterium, a heavier form of hydrogen, in the Martian atmosphere suggests significant water loss over time, with estimates suggesting Mars once had enough water to cover the entire planet to a depth of up to 137 meters.\n\nThe discovery challenges previous beliefs about the sporadic nature of water on Mars, indicating a more continuous presence. This finding bolsters the possibility of habitability on the planet, although the exact extent of life remains speculative. The upcoming Exomars rover mission and ongoing research, such as methane detection, continue to explore the potential for past or present microbial life on Mars.\n\nIn conclusion, recent advances in our understanding of Mars' ancient water history paint a picture of a once-much wetter and more habitable planet, raising the likelihood of past or even extant life, despite the current inhospitable conditions.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The court ruled that Nestlé failed to prove the shape alone was distinctive enough to be registered as an EU trademark, requiring evidence of recognition across all EU member states, not just a significant part. This decision affects the iconic shape of Kit Kat, which had been protected in Europe since 2012, but now the trademark may be annulled. The saga began in 2002 when Nestlé applied for a shape trademark, leading to a lengthy legal battle with rival Mondelez, which includes Cadbury and other brands like Toblerone.\n\nThe ECJ's ruling states that a product must demonstrate distinctiveness in every EU country for a trademark to be upheld. The case highlights the importance of proving recognition across the entire bloc, not just certain regions, and sets a precedent for future trademark disputes.

The study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzes the vocalizations of living birds and their dinosaur ancestors, proposing that a bird-like esophageal pouch enabled dinosaurs to produce low-frequency, throaty sounds, similar to the coo of a dove or the mumble of an ostrich.\n\nThe research also reveals that the famous T. rex roar in \"Jurassic Park\" was a creation of Hollywood, combining various animal sounds – a mixture of elephant, tiger, and alligator noises – to create an artificial effect. The study suggests that dinosaurs may have communicated with closed-mouth sounds, which are common in birds with large esophageal pouches, like doves and ostriches.\n\nThe study further explores the possibility that some dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies, might have had vocalizations closer to bird-like calls, hinting at the presence of a bird-like syrinx, the vocal organ in birds, in dinosaurs. While the exact sounds remain a mystery due to lack of fossil evidence, the study provides insights into the potential diversity of dinosaur vocalizations.\n\nIn the realm of Jurassic World, the film's sound design incorporated real-life animal sounds, such as a tortoise's mating call for velociraptors and a goose's hiss for the T. rex's menacing approach. The iconic T. rex roar was created using baby elephants' cries, a raspy horse breath, and a slowed-down baby elephant sound, demonstrating the artistry in blending natural and synthetic elements.\n\nThe study also highlights the rarity of dinosaur vocalizations, with only a fraction of dinosaur species having been discovered, leaving much of their vocal capabilities unknown. However, the analysis of bird-like vocalizations in dinosaurs suggests that these ancient creatures might have had a more complex communication system than previously imagined.\n\nIn conclusion, while the roaring T. rex remains a popular cultural stereotype, recent research paints a more nuanced picture of dinosaur vocalizations, pointing to the possibility of quiet, bird-like sounds in some cases, and emphasizing the ongoing mystery surrounding the true nature of dinosaur communication.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

During the attack, State Department officials were concerned about the potential impact of uniformed Marines on diplomatic relations, suggesting they wear civilian clothing. The report also exposes discrepancies between the public statements and private communications of top officials, with Secretary Clinton initially describing the attack as a result of a protest rather than a terrorist act.

The investigation concludes that there was no stand-down order, no evidence of gun trading, and no attempt to politicize the situation. However, it does criticize the State Department for not adequately addressing the growing extremism in Libya and for misrepresenting the Benghazi attack as a protest-related event.\n\nRanking Democrat Rep.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, highlights a lack of decline in obesity rates in any country over the past three decades.\n\nIn the US, approximately 85 million people are obese, with another 300 million being overweight. Obesity rates are alarmingly high in some countries, reaching over 50% in men in Tonga and Kuwait, and women in Tonga, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Samoa, and Tonga. The situation is particularly concerning as obesity coexists with hunger in many nations.\n\nWhile obesity is more prevalent in developed countries like the US, it is also increasing in developing nations. In the US, obesity rates have slowed in recent years, but globally, obesity rates are accelerating, especially among children. The Lancet report suggests that factors contributing to obesity include increased caloric intake, changes in diet, reduced physical activity, and altered gut bacteria.\n\nThe obesity epidemic is a major public health concern, linked to numerous chronic diseases. While the problem is most severe in the Middle East and North Africa, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait topping the list, obesity affects both genders and age groups worldwide. The situation has prompted the World Health Organization to launch a commission to address childhood obesity, with a report due in 2015.\n\nThe obesity crisis underscores the need for a multifaceted approach, addressing the affordability and accessibility of unhealthy food, promoting healthier lifestyles, and tackling the root causes of obesity on a global scale.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns. The 188-country study found that there are 2.1 billion overweight or obese people in the world, making up around 30% of the world's population, up from 20% in 1980, USA Today reports. Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country held its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to lead, followed by the more conservative Nour party. The elections, held amidst ongoing trials of former President Hosni Mubarak, who was accused of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression, have raised concerns about the balance of power between the military council, the Brotherhood, and other opposition groups. The military council's control is being challenged, with protests planned to mark the one-year anniversary of Mubarak's ousting.\n\nThe election slowdown has affected the Egyptian economy, with foreign currency reserves declining and the stock market experiencing significant losses.

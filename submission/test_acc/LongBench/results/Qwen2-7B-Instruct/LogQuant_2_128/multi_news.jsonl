The judge, William P. Brady, ordered McCullough's release from prison pending the outcome of a new trial. Brady cited evidence that McCullough was in Rockford, Illinois, 40 miles away from the scene of the crime, when Maria was abducted.

This bacterium, responsible for causing serious infections such as pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, and sepsis, is already known to be more challenging to combat due to its resistance to antibiotics. However, recent studies have revealed that cigarette smoke exacerbates the situation by making MRSA more resistant to the body's natural defenses, including reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, and by altering the cell wall structure, making the bacteria more resilient to immune responses.

The findings suggest that cigarette smoke not only damages the smoker's health but also enhances the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and potentially more dangerous.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

Despite NBC promoting Schwarzenegger's hosting role, the ratings were down from Trump's tenure, with the show's audience being notably smaller compared to the previous season, which had an average of 7.6 million viewers.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The policy is designed to give employees the option to return to work part-time or full-time, and even take additional leave later in the year if needed. Netflix's Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz, stated that the policy is intended to help employees focus on their personal growth and performance at work, rather than being preoccupied with home life.

{"pred": "Colorectal cancer, often considered a disease primarily affecting older men, is increasingly being diagnosed in younger individuals, according to recent studies. A team led by Dr. Samantha Hendre conducted an analysis using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data, revealing that 15% of colorectal patients are under 50 years old. These younger patients are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer, yet they receive more aggressive treatments, including surgery and radiation, compared to older patients. Despite having more severe conditions, younger patients tend to have slightly better outcomes, living longer without cancer recurrence. This finding suggests that the traditional screening recommendation at age 50 might need reconsideration, especially considering the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger individuals. Dr. Hendre's team's analysis indicates that the medical community should reassess its approach to colorectal cancer screening and treatment for younger patients, potentially leading to earlier detection and better outcomes. However, the exact impact of these changes on screening recommendations remains uncertain, and further research is needed to understand the implications fully. The study highlights the importance of recognizing symptoms like bleeding, changes in bowel movements, and pain, and the need for more personalized screening based on individual risk factors. The rising trend in younger colorectal cancer cases necessitates a reevaluation of current guidelines and practices, with the potential for a shift in screening age to improve outcomes and address the growing health concerns.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

{"pred": "In recent astronomical research, a new perspective on galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to harness stellar energy has emerged. The paper, authored by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermilab and a professor at the University of Chicago, suggests that the only way for civilizations to prevent themselves from becoming isolated in the vastness of the universe is to harvest energy from distant stars. Hooper's theory builds upon the work of astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, who proposed the three levels of galactic expansion in 1962. Hooper's paper, however, introduces a twist to Kardashev's original concept. Hooper argues that the expansion of the universe, driven by dark energy, could lead to the displacement of civilizations' energy sources. To counteract this, civilizations might attempt to harness the energy of distant stars, potentially leading to a race against time to capture stellar energy before it's too late. This could involve Dyson spheres, giant structures that would surround a star, harnessing its energy. Hooper's paper suggests that civilizations might create Dyson spheres to prevent the expansion of the universe from pushing them out of their galactic neighborhood. The paper also discusses the potential for civilizations to recognize the signs of Dyson spheres in the galaxy, which could indicate the presence of advanced civilizations. The paper suggests that Dyson spheres could be used to monitor and possibly control the energy output of a star, allowing civilizations to capture energy from a distance. The paper also suggests that civilizations might be able to recognize Dyson spheres by the unique light signature they emit, which could be detected by astronomers.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "In the world of American politics, several key events and statements have emerged, shaping the landscape of the ongoing campaigns and policy discussions. The latest developments include:\n\n1. **Mitt Romney's Win at CPAC**: In a significant victory, Mitt Romney secured a 38% to 31% lead over Rick Santorum in the recent CPAC presidential straw poll. This outcome, however, has raised questions regarding the tactics used by both campaigns. Rick Santorum, while acknowledging the support from conservative groups like the CPAC attendees, criticized the potential influence of external funding on voter turnout. He also mentioned that his campaign did not engage in such practices, implying that other campaigns might have done so.\n\n2. **Mitt Romney's \"Severe Conservatism\"**: In an attempt to clarify his stance, Mitt Romney described himself as a \"severe conservative\", a term that has sparked debate. His explanation was aimed at distinguishing himself from his opponents, particularly in terms of his commitment to conservative principles.\n\n3. **Jack Lew's Defense of the Administration's Position on Birth Control**: White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew, in response to the ongoing controversy around the administration's stance on contraception, defended the President's position. He stated that President Obama's approach has remained consistent, despite the recent accommodation offered to address concerns from religious groups. Lew emphasized that the President's position aligns with the broader consensus on the importance of access to contraception, highlighting the administration's commitment to public health initiatives.\n\n4. **Jack Lew's Accommodation Explanation**: Lew further clarified that the President's approach is based on providing a solution that allows for insurance companies to cover contraception without directly funding it, aiming to avoid any appearance of government coercion or interference in personal choices. This explanation underscores the administration's strategy to balance public health needs with respect for individual rights and beliefs.\n\n5. **Jack Lew's Defense of the Administration's Stance**: In defending the President's position, Lew emphasized that the accommodation provided is designed to ensure that insurance companies bear the cost of contraceptives, thereby reducing the financial burden on individuals. This approach, according to Lew, is aimed at promoting access to healthcare without compromising religious liberties or political positions.\n\nIn summary, the week's news highlights the ongoing debates within the Republican Party, Mitt Romney's strategic positioning, and the White House's defense of its stance on birth control coverage, emphasizing consistency and accommodation in addressing sensitive issues.\n\n**Note**: The summary does not include specific details on the straw poll results or the exact nature of the accommodation referred to", "answers": ["Fresh off his loss to Mitt Romney at CPAC, Rick Santorum hit the talk shows this morning, and he's downplaying the victory, reports Politico: \"You have to talk to the Romney campaign and how many tickets they bought—we've heard all sorts of things,\" Santorum told CNN. \"Ron Paul has won those (straw polls) because he trucks in a lot of people, pays for their ticket, and they come in and vote.

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was significantly influenced by environmental changes and the need for innovation, information sharing, and trading. Three new studies, published in the journal Science, indicate that the Middle Stone Age tools and trading networks emerged around 300,000 years ago, earlier than previously thought. This discovery challenges the notion that modern behaviors and innovations occurred solely with Homo sapiens, suggesting that the evolution of modern human ancestors was a continuous process. The researchers found that the Middle Stone Age tools, including spears and blades, were made from exotic materials like obsidian, indicating the existence of long-distance trade networks. The study also uncovered the earliest evidence of pigment use, suggesting that ancient humans engaged in symbolic and trading activities, which could have been crucial for their survival during unpredictable environmental conditions. This finding supports the idea that Homo sapiens and their ancestors adapted to changing landscapes by developing more sophisticated tools, expanding their social networks, and trading resources, leading to the emergence of complex technologies and trading networks. The discovery of these ancient tools and pigments indicates that Homo sapiens and their ancestors had already developed advanced cognitive abilities and trading practices before the emergence of Homo sapiens. This suggests that the evolution of Homo sapiens was influenced by environmental changes, leading to the development of trading and information-sharing practices, which are foundational to the emergence of modern human societies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Katriuk, who lived in Canada since the 1950s, was targeted by the Russian government for his alleged participation in the atrocity, which included a massacre in Khatyn, a village in Belarus. The Canadian government, however, declined to extrad him, citing a lack of evidence linking him to the atrocities. \n\nIn the days following Katriuk's death, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs in Canada called on Ottawa to ensure accountability for any war crimes committed by Katriuk. This came amid growing tensions between Canada and Russia, with the latter seeking to use Katriuk's case to distract from Canada's stance against Russia's annexation of Crimea and interference in Ukraine. \n\nKatriuk's death prompted renewed calls for Canada to hold him accountable for his actions, especially considering the Russian government's request for his trial. The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs emphasized the importance of ensuring justice for war crimes committed during World War II, urging Canada to take appropriate measures to address Katriuk's case. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress, a prominent Canadian organization representing Ukrainian interests, also weighed in, stating that Canada's decision not to strip Katriuk of his Canadian citizenship in 2007 was based on insufficient evidence.

This comes after years of debate and discussion on the issue. The new law, which was approved by the Jamaican parliament, allows the possession of up to 56 grams of marijuana to be treated as a petty offense, rather than a criminal one. It also permits the cultivation of up to five plants per person and establishes a licensing system for the production and sale of medical-grade marijuana. The law also legalizes the use of marijuana for religious purposes, particularly for the Rastafarian community, and permits tourists who have been prescribed marijuana for medical reasons to purchase permits to buy marijuana in Jamaica. The Jamaican government, however, maintains that the new law does not intend to create a free-for-all in the growing, dealing, or exporting of marijuana, and the security forces will continue to enforce Jamaican law, including its commitments under international treaties. The law is expected to lead to a more regulated and controlled cannabis industry, potentially benefitingting the economy and providing a legal framework for the medical and industrial use of marijuana. However, the law does not intend to undermine the existing laws regarding the trafficking of marijuana into the United States, and it is expected that Jamaica, along with other nations, will uphold their commitments to combat and dismantle criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking. The Jamaican government hopes that the new legislation will lead to a more controlled and regulated cannabis industry, which could contribute to economic growth and development, especially in the health and wellness sectors.

Federal marshals conducted raids on Gibson's facilities in Tennessee, seizing wood shipments suspected of being illegally harvested. This action stemmed from Gibson's alleged involvement in a supply chain linked to illegal timber extraction, which violated the Lacey Act—a law that prohibits the trade in illegally obtained wildlife, plants, and their derivatives.\n\nGibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, expressed frustration over the lack of clarity regarding the company's compliance with the law, stating that the government had caused significant damage to the business without providing a fair opportunity to defend themselves. Gibson's actions in Madagascar were scrutinized by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), which concluded that Gibson had engaged in activities that risked the depletion of natural resources.\n\nThe Lacey Act, enforced by the U.S. government, aims to protect endangered species by requiring companies to ensure the legality of their supply chains, including the origin of the wood used in their products. Gibson's actions in Madagascar sparked controversy, leading to a ban on the export of certain woods, including those used in guitars. This has led to a shift in the industry, with companies like Martin's Chris Martin advocating for the Lacey Act, despite acknowledging its administrative complexities.\n\nAttorney Ronald Bienstock noted that the Lacey Act's retroactive nature poses challenges for older instruments and parts, urging caution among guitar makers.

{"pred": "In recent findings published by NASA, scientists discovered that Mars once had a global ocean covering a significant portion of its surface, similar to Earth's oceans. This discovery was made by analyzing the chemical composition of water molecules in the Martian atmosphere, revealing that Mars lost a substantial amount of water over time due to its thin atmosphere. The water vapor analyzed showed that Mars had a higher proportion of deuterium (heavy hydrogen) compared to Earth, indicating that Mars once had a large volume of water, equivalent to a depth of 137 meters, covering the northern lowlands of the planet. This ancient Martian ocean persisted for a considerable length of time, providing ample opportunity for the development of an environment conducive to life, as suggested by the paper by Geronimo et al. in Science. The discovery of this ancient Martian ocean strengthens the possibility of the Red Planet harboring conditions favorable for the emergence of life, as it suggests Mars had a warmer and wetter environment in the distant past. This new understanding of Mars' ancient ocean expands our knowledge of the planet's potential for supporting life and raises intriguing questions about the possibility of extraterrestrial life existing on Mars. The findings contribute to ongoing efforts to determine whether Mars was ever inhabited by microbial life, and they offer hope for future missions to uncover more about the planet's past environments.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

The team, led by Chad Eliason and Tobias Riede, analyzed the vocalizations of 200 bird species and found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are often associated with birds making low, rumbling sounds, are likely to have evolved multiple times in birds and crocodiles. The researchers suggest that dinosaurs, being part of the same group as birds and crocodiles, may have had the ability to make sounds akin to birds' closed-mouth vocalizations, which could have included low-frequency sounds, such as the cooing of a dove or the grunting of an ostrich. The study, which looked at the evolution of vocalizations in birds, suggests that dinosaurs, including some non-avian dinosaurs, may have had the capacity to make sounds similar to birds, but with a twist - they might have made low, rumbling vocalizations that could have been heard by rivals or potential mates. The researchers believe that dinosaurs, like birds, might have had the ability to make deep, resonant vocalizations, potentially allowing them to communicate with low-frequency sounds that could have been heard by other dinosaurs.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

In a groundbreaking study published in the journal Current Biology, the team used a computer model to reconstruct the visual input from brain activity patterns detected by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The process involved analyzing the brain's response to moving images, such as colors, shapes, and movements, and translating them back into visual stimuli. This could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the human mind, including the ability to decode dreams, thoughts, and even the abstract concepts that make up the human imagination.

The committee's final report, released on September 11th, contradicts previous statements regarding the video that sparked protests in the region. It was revealed that the State Department was concerned about the speed and effectiveness of the response, particularly in light of the video controversy. The report also highlights the State Department's concern about the potential impact of the video on diplomatic relations in the region. The report further emphasizes the State Department's focus on the video's role in the attack, rather than addressing the actual events and potential threats posed by the attack itself.

Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

This represents a significant health concern, with the United States leading the world in obesity prevalence, followed closely by other developed countries. The issue is not confined to wealthy nations, however, as obesity rates are also high in many developing countries, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of the Pacific and Caribbean. The report indicates that obesity rates have risen dramatically over the past few decades, with the number of overweight or obese individuals increasing from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013. The report suggests that obesity is a worldwide issue, with no country experiencing a decline in obesity rates over the last three decades. The report also highlights the economic and social factors contributing to obesity, such as the availability of unhealthy food options and sedentary lifestyles. The report concludes that obesity is a pressing health issue that requires urgent attention and intervention to address its root causes and prevent further spread.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

The cause of death was determined to be strangulation. Toronto police initially classified the deaths as suspicious, but the couple's family disputes the theory that the deaths were a result of a murder-suicide. The family states that the couple's actions were consistent with their love for each other and their commitment to their community, and that the theory was not supported by their friends, colleagues, and the community. The couple's children refute the theory that the deaths were a result of a murder-suicide. The Apotex founder was the 15th richest person in Canada, with a net worth of $4.77 billion. The couple's philanthropic activities included support for higher education, health care, and Jewish organizations. The couple's friends and colleagues expressed shock and disbelief at the theory of a murder-suicide, with many describing Barry as a workaholic and Honey as a dedicated philanthropist.

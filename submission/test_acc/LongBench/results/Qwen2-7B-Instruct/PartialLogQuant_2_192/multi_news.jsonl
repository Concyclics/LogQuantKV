The study, led by Dr. Laura E.

This effect is particularly concerning as MRSA is a common cause of hospital-acquired infections and is known to be more prevalent in smokers populations.\n\nThe researchers found that when MRSA is exposed to cigarette smoke, it becomes more resistant to the immune system's defenses, including reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides. This increased resistance leads to a higher chance of survival for the bacteria, making it more difficult to treat. The study also suggests that the effects of cigarette smoke on MRSA are more pronounced than those of e-cigarette vapor, which was explored in a previous study by the same team.\n\nThe data indicates that the presence of cigarette smoke can lead to a longer-lasting and more severe infection, as the smoke-stressed MRSA bacteria are more likely to cause pneumonia and other lung infections. The study further suggests that the duration of the smoke exposure to MRSA bacteria can influence the bacteria's ability to cause harm, with longer exposure leading to a more significant increase in the bacteria's resistance to immune defenses.\n\nIn conclusion, the research highlights the need for further investigation into the potential health risks associated with smoking, particularly in relation to the increased vulnerability to bacterial infections.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The policy states that Samsung collects data on user interactions with the TV, including voice commands, to improve the user experience. However, Samsung will still gather data about usage patterns even when the smart TV is turned off, which has raised concerns about privacy. \n\nMicrosoft's Xbox One console also faced criticism for its always-on listening feature, which allows the console to be turned on instantly with a voice command.

These images, taken in a Washington state basement, depict Nirvana's early days, including a shot of the band performing Led Zeppelin's \"Heartbreaker\" and other nascent songs like \"Aero Zeppelin\". The guitarist's daughter, Maggie Poukkala, shared the photos on Twitter, revealing that her father, Tony Poukkula, was part of the band that night. The photos were found among Cobain's personal belongings and led to the realization that they captured Nirvana's first performance. This event is considered a significant moment in the band's formation, and the photos have been widely shared online.\n\nSecondly, the Montage of Heck, a documentary about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, has been making a comeback.

The tax was intended to reduce sugar consumption, fund education programs, and subsidize healthy food for low-income families. However, the tax has faced criticism for its unintended consequences. \n\nSeattle's tax has led to a significant increase in the price of sweetened beverages. For example, a case of Gatorade that previously cost $15.99 now costs $26.27, an increase of over 60%. This has prompted businesses to post signs directing customers to stores outside the city where the tax is not applied. \n\nBusinesses have reported a decline in sales of sweetened beverages, with some seeing a 38% increase in sales of drinks outside the city. This has led to a loss of revenue for businesses and a shift in shopping habits. Seattle's tax has been compared to a regressive tax, affecting low-income individuals disproportionately. \n\nThe tax has also faced legal challenges. The Illinois Retail Merchants Association and the American Heart Association criticized the tax, arguing that it would not improve health outcomes and would disproportionately affect low-income individuals. The tax was also found to be counterproductive, as it drove shoppers to buy drinks outside the city, thus depriving local businesses of sales.\n\nThe tax was intended to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks, which are linked to health issues like diabetes and heart disease.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

This includes a diverse range of public figures, from politicians to CEOs, whose circumstances have dramatically shifted, leading to their loss of influence and power.\n\nOne such notable example is the case of Anthony Scaramucci, who was swiftly removed from his role as a communications director in the Trump administration. His brief tenure was marked by controversy, including his profanity-laced interview and his derogatory remarks about colleagues. Similarly, Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, has seen his reputation tarnished amidst allegations of political maneuvering and personal scandals, culminating in his departure from the public eye.\n\nThe saga of James Comey, the former FBI director, illustrates the complexities of power and influence. His career took a dramatic turn when he was unexpectedly dismissed by President Donald Trump, sparking debates on the impact of personal actions on professional standing. The story of Mark Fields, the former CEO of Ford, underscores the challenges faced by leaders in maintaining shareholder trust and navigating the volatile landscape of corporate leadership.\n\nLastly, the tale of Tiger Woods, the professional golfer, highlights the cyclical nature of success and failure in the public eye.

The bill includes delaying the ACA for one year and repealing the medical device tax. The House is considering this as a compromise, while the Senate is expected to reject the bill. The bill's fate hinges on the Senate's response, and a short-term government shutdown seems likely if the impasse continues.\n\nIn the second article, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a firm stance against negotiations with the House Republicans, advocating for a government shutdown to avoid compromising the Affordable Care Act. He believes that the House Republicans are engaging in a political game rather than addressing the fiscal issues. Reid's strategy is to avoid any concessions on the ACA, hoping to force the Republicans to accept a clean bill. The House Republicans, however, are pushing for a bill that includes the ACA delay and medical device tax repeal, which could lead to a stalemate and a government shutdown.\n\nThe third article focuses on the potential impacts of a government shutdown on the Washington region's economy. The region, heavily reliant on federal employment, could face a significant economic downturn due to the shutdown. The region's economy, which is already weakened by sequester cuts, could lose $42 billion annually, and income from federal employees and contractors could decrease. The article suggests that mail service, emergency services, and other essential functions might continue, but non-essential services, such as trash collection and library operations, could be disrupted.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The existence of this planet has been proposed based on the observed clustering of smaller, icy objects in the outer solar system, which appears to be influenced by the gravitational pull of a massive planet. The Caltech researchers, Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have not observed the planet directly, but their models predict that it exerts a significant gravitational influence on the smaller bodies in the outer solar system.\n\nThe existence of Planet Nine has sparked excitement among some astronomers circles, who are eager to find definitive proof of its existence. However, others, including the lead researcher, Mike Brown, argue that the existence of Planet Nine should not be the primary focus. They contend that the discovery of a new planet would merely add to the confusion and complexity of the current model of the solar system. Brown, who previously gained recognition for his role in the demotion of Pluto from planet status, maintains that the solar system should be defined by its eight primary planets, each occupying distinct orbits and influencing the dynamics of the system.\n\nBrown's work on Planet Nine has been met with mixed reactions.

This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that colorectal cancer is predominantly an \"elderly\" disease.\n\nA study by Dr. Samantha Hendre and colleagues, published in the journal Cancer, analyzed colorectal cancer cases in the US between 1998 and 2011. They found that 15% of colorectal cancer patients were under 50 years old. These younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, but they also received more aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation, compared to older patients. Despite having more severe conditions, younger patients showed slightly better outcomes in terms of survival, with a slight increase in the five-year survival rate for localized tumors patients.\n\nDr. Hendre and her team concluded that the medical community should be alerted to the growing number of younger patients with colorectal cancer. They suggested that the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger individuals might necessitate reconsidering screening guidelines. However, the exact impact of changing screening recommendations on improving survival outcomes and reducing mortality remains uncertain. The studies highlight the need for further research to understand the underlying causes of the increased prevalence of colorectal cancer in younger populations and to develop appropriate interventions and treatments for this growing demographic.\n\nIn summary, the analysis of colorectal cancer trends in younger patients indicates a shift in the age at diagnosis, with more aggressive treatments and potentially better outcomes for younger patients. This suggests a need for further investigation into the causes of this trend and potential adjustments to screening and treatment protocols.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

To prevent this cosmic isolation, Hooper theorizes that advanced civilizations might harness the energy from distant stars through Dyson spheres - colossal structures composed of satellites that form a shell around a star, capturing and utilizing its energy. This Dyson sphere concept, originally proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1960, has been revisited by Hooper, who posits that such megastructures could be used to search for alien civilizations. \n\nHooper's paper also delves into the idea that Dyson spheres could be used to transport stars themselves, by using the energy from the star to propel it towards a Dyson sphere, effectively creating a Dyson starship.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

{"pred": "The Daily Show, a satirical news program hosted by Jon Stewart, underwent a significant transformation under his leadership. Stewart, a fan of political and pop culture, sought to shift the show's focus from merely mocking to providing insightful and purposeful commentary. This shift was evident in the show's coverage of the 2000 presidential election, particularly during a memorable encounter with John McCain's campaign. Steve Carell, a correspondent on the show, asked McCain a question about his favorite movie, leading to a humorous exchange. This moment marked a turning point for the show, as it began to aim for a more serious and impactful direction. The show's style and content evolved to reflect a deeper understanding of the political process, moving beyond the traditional \"gotcha\" style of questioning to a more analytical approach. The show's correspondents, including Stephen Colbert, Mo Rocca, and Steve Carell, played pivotal roles in this evolution, with Colbert's character, for instance, embodying a style that contrasted with the typical \"gotcha\" approach. The show's focus on the \"meeting\" rather than the \"appearance\" of political events was a significant departure from the norm. The show's success was also a result of its ability to blend humor with a critical examination of the political landscape, a skill that Stewart and his team honed over time. The show's influence extended beyond its cable network, with a dedicated following and a unique voice that set it apart from the traditional news and entertainment landscape. The show's evolution mirrored the broader changes in the media and political spheres, including the rise of alternative platforms and the expansion of the Internet. The show's satirical take on the political and media landscape, combined with its growing critical acclaim, positioned it as a cultural touchstone. The show's impact was further amplified by its ability to bridge the gap between the appearance and the reality of political processes, a space that had not been explored in depth by mainstream media.

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was significantly influenced by the environment, particularly the climate and landscape changes. Three new studies, published in the journal Science, indicate that the Middle Stone Age tools, which are considered the oldest of their kind, date back approximately 320,000 years. This discovery challenges the notion that modern behaviors and tool-making techniques emerged only after the Homo sapiens appeared around 160,000 years ago. Instead, the researchers propose that the advanced tool technology and trading networks among dispersed groups of Homo sapiens or their close relatives contributed to the development of these sophisticated tools and trading practices.\n\nThe Middle Stone Age tools, including spears, axes, and blades, were found to be more specialized and finely crafted, indicating a shift towards smaller, more efficient tools. The use of exotic materials like obsidian, a type of volcanic rock, suggests that these early humans engaged in trading and foraging for resources over long distances, which required a level of innovation and information sharing akin to modern social networks. Additionally, the discovery of red and black pigments indicates the use of color in symbolic or decorative purposes, providing insights into the development of artistic expression.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of the climate and geological events in shaping the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors. The climate fluctuations, including droughts and earthquakes, forced early humans to adapt by moving, trading resources, and innovating their tool-making techniques. This adaptation led to the development of trading networks, which facilitated the exchange of goods and ideas, similar to contemporary social structures. The findings suggest that the evolution of Homo sapiens was intertwined with the environment, leading to the development of advanced cognitive abilities, including the ability to process and trade exotic materials, and the creation of symbols, which are foundational to the development of complex societies and cultures. The discovery of these ancient tools and pigments suggests that Homo sapiens and their ancestors were capable of sophisticated thinking and social organization, which played a crucial role in their survival and evolution.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish advocacy organization, had called for Katriuk's accountability for the crimes he allegedly committed during the war. \n\nIn 1999, the Canadian court ruled that Katriuk had lied about his service to the Nazis to secure Canadian citizenship, but lacked sufficient evidence of war crimes. In 2007, the Canadian government decided not to revoke his citizenship, citing insufficient evidence. \n\nIn 2012, Per Anders Rudling, a historian, published a study linking Katriuk to the 1943 massacre in Khatyn, a village in Belarus.

{"pred": "In recent findings published by NASA, scientists discovered that Mars had a substantial ocean covering a significant portion of its surface in the distant past. This ocean persisted for millions of years, reaching depths of at least 137 meters, and was located primarily in the northern lowlands of the planet. The discovery was made by analyzing the chemical composition of water molecules in the Martian atmosphere, which showed that the planet once harbored a large volume of water, similar to Earth's oceans. The water molecules contained a higher proportion of heavy hydrogen isotopes compared to Earth's water, indicating that Mars had a more extensive and prolonged period of standing water than previously estimated.\n\nThe research team utilized data collected from the Keck II telescope, the Infrared Telescope Facility, and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. These observations revealed that Mars had a global ocean covering approximately 15% of its surface area, with the deepest pools of water concentrated in the northern lowlands. The scientists calculated that Mars had a global ocean covering 1 to 2 meters below the surface, which would have been sufficient to cover the entire planet if evenly distributed. However, due to the planet's unique geological features, the water predominantly accumulated in the northern lowlands, creating a standing body of water that was at least a mile deep in certain areas.\n\nThe team's findings align with earlier studies suggesting that Mars had a more extensive and prolonged period of standing water than previously thought. This discovery adds to the growing evidence that Mars may have been capable of supporting life, as liquid water is essential for biological processes. However, the existence of life on Mars remains uncertain, as the presence of liquid water does not guarantee the presence of life itself. The possibility of extraterrestrial life originating from Mars cannot be ruled out, as the planet's geological features and chemical composition could have provided conditions conducive to the emergence of life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, Nestlé successfully challenged this decision in 2016, arguing that the shape of the KitKat was widely recognized as distinctive across the EU. The European Court of Justice upheld Nestlé's position, overturning the EUIPO's original rejection of Nestlé's trademark claim.\n\nMondelez, the owner of the Kvikk Lunsj brand, had also contested Nestlé's trademark claim. The court's ruling means that Nestlé's trademark for the distinctive shape of the KitKat bar is nullified, leaving open the possibility for other companies to produce similar-looking products without infringing Nestlé's trademark rights. However, the ruling does not negate the trademark rights for the brand name \"KitKat.\"\n\nThe ruling has implications beyond Nestlé, affecting other multinational companies that operate within the EU. It highlights the complexities of securing trademark protections for products that enjoy widespread popularity across international markets, particularly in the context of the EU's internal market regulations. The decision underscores the importance of demonstrating that a trademark is distinctive and recognizable across all EU countries, not just in specific regions or markets.\n\nThe ruling has sparked renewed interest in the ongoing disputes between multinational corporations regarding trademark protections for their products, particularly in light of the impact of Brexit on the UK's relationship with the EU. The decision could pave the way for other companies to produce similar-looking products without infringing on Nestlé's trademark, potentially disrupting the market dynamics for the popular snack globally.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters. The brand name itself of \"KitKat\" is not being contested. (Atari accused Nestle of ripping off one of its popular video games in an ad for KitKat.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1828}

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

Bayesian statistics, named after the 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, allows for the consideration of various theories and data simultaneously, updating probabilities as new information becomes available. This approach helps to identify the most likely location of a missing object, such as the Air France plane, by considering the probability of different causes, the likelihood of finding the plane in previously searched areas, and the probability of the plane being in specific locations based on historical data and current searches.\n\nIn the case of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Colleen M. Keller and her team at Metron used Bayesian methods to analyze the available data, including the plane's last known location, historical crash data, and the results of previous searches. They created a probability map that indicated the most likely areas to search, which led to the discovery of the plane. However, the team acknowledges that the success of this method depends on the quality of the data and the assumptions made. The Bayesian approach allows for the incorporation of new information and the adjustment of probabilities accordingly, leading to more efficient search operations.

After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough is innocent. While the judge Friday vacated McCullough's conviction, he stopped short of declaring him innocent, and a new trial will be held, the Chicago Tribune reports. McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents—including phone and Air Force records—supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial. A friend of the kidnapped girl picked McCullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened. But his was the only non-yearbook photo in the lineup, and she picked a different man out of a photo lineup 50 years earlier. That info wasn't allowed at McCullough's trial either. No physical evidence was ever found to support McCullough's conviction."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2195}

This led to a number of well-known brands, including Ford, Geico, and McDonald's, deciding to no longer advertise on Limbaugh's show or other programs featuring similarly contentious content. The issue was highlighted in a memo circulated by Premiere Radio Networks, which syndicates Limbaugh's show, to traffic managers at various stations. The memo stated that advertisers wanted to avoid content that might provoke negative feelings among a tiny portion of the audience. As a result, Limbaugh's show has seen an increase in public service announcements sponsored by the government, rather than by private companies. The sketch of the situation was humorously depicted in a skit on the SNL show, where Taran Killam portrayed Limbaugh, but the sketch was criticized for being repetitive.

The study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander and her team at the University of California, San Diego, revealed that cigarette smoke can alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to immune defenses. This effect is particularly concerning as MRSA is a common cause of hospital-acquired infections and is known to be more prevalent in smokers populations.\n\nThe researchers found that when MRSA is exposed to cigarette smoke, it becomes more resistant to the immune system's defenses, including reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides. This increased resistance leads to a higher chance of survival for the bacteria, making it more difficult to treat. The study also suggests that the effects of cigarette smoke on MRSA are more pronounced than those of e-cigarette vapor, which was explored in a previous study by the same team.\n\nThe data indicates that the presence of cigarette smoke can lead to a longer-lasting and more severe infection, as the smoke-stressed MRSA bacteria are more likely to cause pneumonia and other lung infections. The study further suggests that the duration of the smoke exposure to MRSA bacteria can influence the bacteria's ability to cause harm, with longer exposure leading to a more significant increase in the bacteria's resistance to immune defenses.\n\nIn conclusion, the research highlights the need for further investigation into the potential health risks associated with smoking, particularly in relation to the increased vulnerability to bacterial infections. The findings underscore the importance of smoking cessation to reduce the risk of developing severe respiratory infections and the need for more effective treatments for MRSA and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The bill includes delaying the ACA for one year and repealing the medical device tax. The House is considering this as a compromise, while the Senate is expected to reject the bill.

He believes that the House Republicans are engaging in a political game rather than addressing the fiscal issues. Reid's strategy is to avoid any concessions on the ACA, hoping to force the Republicans to accept a clean bill.

Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The study, conducted by researchers at the New York University Langone Medical Center, involved 9,550 adults with CAD and found that those with the highest body weight variability over a four-year period had a 78% higher risk of death, a 136% higher risk of heart attack, a 124% higher risk of stroke, and a 117% higher risk of developing diabetes.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

Traditionally, screening recommendations suggested starting at age 50, but new data indicates that one in seven colorectal cancers occurs in people under 50. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that colorectal cancer is predominantly an \"elderly\" disease.\n\nA study by Dr. Samantha Hendre and colleagues, published in the journal Cancer, analyzed colorectal cancer cases in the US between 1998 and 2011. They found that 15% of colorectal cancer patients were under 50 years old. These younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, but they also received more aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation, compared to older patients. Despite having more severe conditions, younger patients showed slightly better outcomes in terms of survival, with a slight increase in the five-year survival rate for localized tumors patients.\n\nDr. Hendre and her team concluded that the medical community should be alerted to the growing number of younger patients with colorectal cancer. They suggested that the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger individuals might necessitate reconsidering screening guidelines. However, the exact impact of changing screening recommendations on improving survival outcomes and reducing mortality remains uncertain. The studies highlight the need for further research to understand the underlying causes of the increased prevalence of colorectal cancer in younger populations and to develop appropriate interventions and treatments for this growing demographic.\n\nIn summary, the analysis of colorectal cancer trends in younger patients indicates a shift in the age at diagnosis, with more aggressive treatments and potentially better outcomes for younger patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The paper, authored by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermilab and the University of Chicago, suggests that the expansion of the universe, driven by dark energy, could leave the energy sources of distant galaxies inaccessible to any civilization. To prevent this cosmic isolation, Hooper theorizes that advanced civilizations might harness the energy from distant stars through Dyson spheres - colossal structures composed of satellites that form a shell around a star, capturing and utilizing its energy. This Dyson sphere concept, originally proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1960, has been revisited by Hooper, who posits that such megastructures could be used to search for alien civilizations. \n\nHooper's paper also delves into the idea that Dyson spheres could be used to transport stars themselves, by using the energy from the star to propel it towards a Dyson sphere, effectively creating a Dyson starship. This concept, while intriguing, is highly speculative and requires further investigation. \n\nIn a separate development, a new paper on the preprint journal arXiv.org has sparked interest in the potential for advanced civilizations to harness the energy of distant stars. The paper, authored by Hooper, suggests that Dyson spheres, or Dyson shells, could be used to capture and transport energy from stars, potentially allowing for interstellar travel. Hooper's theory aligns with the idea that energy from stars could be used to create Dyson spheres, which could then be used to transport the star itself, allowing for intergalactic travel. \n\nHooper's work builds upon the original Dyson sphere concept, which was first introduced by Freeman Dyson in 1960. Dyson's original proposal involved a shell of satellites surrounding a star, capturing and utilizing its energy. Hooper's paper explores the possibility that Dyson spheres could be used to transport energy from stars, potentially enabling intergalactic travel. \n\nHooper's paper also suggests that by monitoring the light from stars, astronomers could detect Dyson spheres and Dyson ships, which could indicate the presence of advanced civilizations. The paper further posits that by analyzing the light signature of a Dyson sphere, astronomers could identify the energy output of a star, which would help in locating Dyson spheres. \n\nHooper's work has implications for the search for extraterrestrial life, as it suggests that Dyson spheres could be used to search for advanced civilizations by observing the energy output", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

This comes after Santorum criticized Romney's win, suggesting that the outcome might have been influenced by the strategy of paying for attendees' tickets, a practice often employed by other candidates. However, Santorum's claims were refuted by Romney's campaign, which denied any involvement in such tactics.\n\n2. **Rick Santorum's Concerns**: Santorum expressed his concerns regarding the rigging of political polls, specifically mentioning that candidates like Ron Paul have historically won these polls due to their supporters' attendance at CPAC events. He further stated that his campaign did not engage in such practices, implying that the outcome of the poll might have been influenced by other factors, such as the strategy employed by Romney's campaign.\n\n3. **Jack Lew's Position on Birth Control**: In a discussion surrounding the controversial issue of birth control, White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew clarified the administration's position. Addressing the media, Lew explained that the president's position on the matter has remained consistent, and the \"accommodation\" provided by the administration is the extent to which they are willing to go to address the concerns of religious groups. This accommodation involves insurance companies covering the cost of contraceptives for individuals, rather than directly funding the coverage, which is seen as a way to avoid direct funding of services that may conflict with certain religious beliefs.\n\n4. **Barack Obama's Position on Birth Control**: In a related development, President Barack Obama's stance on birth control was discussed, particularly in relation to the accommodation provided to religious institutions.

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was significantly influenced by the environment, particularly the climate and landscape changes. Three new studies, published in the journal Science, indicate that the Middle Stone Age tools, which are considered the oldest of their kind, date back approximately 320,000 years. This discovery challenges the notion that modern behaviors and tool-making techniques emerged only after the Homo sapiens appeared around 160,000 years ago. Instead, the researchers propose that the advanced tool technology and trading networks among dispersed groups of Homo sapiens or their close relatives contributed to the development of these sophisticated tools and trading practices.\n\nThe Middle Stone Age tools, including spears, axes, and blades, were found to be more specialized and finely crafted, indicating a shift towards smaller, more efficient tools. The use of exotic materials like obsidian, a type of volcanic rock, suggests that these early humans engaged in trading and foraging for resources over long distances, which required a level of innovation and information sharing akin to modern social networks. Additionally, the discovery of red and black pigments indicates the use of color in symbolic or decorative purposes, providing insights into the development of artistic expression.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of the climate and geological events in shaping the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors. The climate fluctuations, including droughts and earthquakes, forced early humans to adapt by moving, trading resources, and innovating their tool-making techniques. This adaptation led to the development of trading networks, which facilitated the exchange of goods and ideas, similar to contemporary social structures. The findings suggest that the evolution of Homo sapiens was intertwined with the environment, leading to the development of advanced cognitive abilities, including the ability to process and trade exotic materials, and the creation of symbols, which are foundational to the development of complex societies and cultures. The discovery of these ancient tools and pigments suggests that Homo sapiens and their ancestors were capable of sophisticated thinking and social organization, which played a crucial role in their survival and evolution.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, justified the removal of the traditional headphone Jack with the phrase \"courage\", suggesting that Apple had the audacity to move forward and do something better for users. Critics argue that Apple's decision to eliminate the widely-used audio standard in favor of its proprietary Lightning cable and Bluetooth technology is absurd, especially considering the superior sound quality of wired headphones compared to wireless ones. The lack of a standard headphone Jack means that users will need to purchase additional adapters cables, which some consider a waste of money and unnecessary. The introduction of the AirPods, Apple's new wireless earphones, has also sparked debate. While some argue that the AirPods offer convenience and improved sound quality, others criticize their design and functionality, questioning the need for stereo speakers and Taptic engines in the iPhone. The AirPods require an iCloud account to function, and the need for a dongle to connect to the iPhone raises questions about the practicality of the product. The event has sparked criticism, with some calling Apple's decision to remove the standard headphone Jack \"hubris\", \"arrogance\", and \"stupidity\". The removal of the standard headphone Jack has led to a loss of compatibility with various devices, including Square's credit card reader, thermal cameras, and other gadgets.

However, the 2006 Military Commissions Act stripped the right to habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere, including legal residents of the US. This has led to a situation where the government can indefinitely detain individuals without providing a fair trial. The Supreme Court is expected to revisit this issue in the upcoming term, potentially restoring habeas corpus rights.\n\nThe second piece of news discusses a legal battle over the rights of two chimpanzees named Hercules and Leo, who are being kept at Stony Brook University. The non-human rights organization, the Nonhuman Rights Project, argues that these chimpanzees should be recognized as legal persons, entitled to habeas corpus protections. The organization claims that the chimpanzees' rights to bodily liberty are being violated, and they should be released to a sanctuary.

Until now in the US, those who've used this legal tactic have been human. But a New York judge yesterday ruled that the writ may be used by two lab chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, Science magazine reports. NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) had previously expressed concerns regarding Gibson's activities in the country, suggesting that the company knowingly engaged in a risky pursuit to source illegal timber.\n\nThe Gibson saga escalated following the implementation of the Lacey Act in 2008, which prohibits the trade of illegally harvested plants and animals. Gibson's relationship with the Malayan government and its attempts to comply with the law were called into question, leading to a legal battle between Gibson and the U.S. government. Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of clarity surrounding the allegations against his company, stating that the business had suffered significant losses without recourse to a fair judicial process.\n\nIn response to these events, Gibson's attorney confirmed that the company had ceased importing timber from Madagascar in 2009, and provided documentation to support their claims of legal timber acquisition. However, the company's actions sparked controversy within the guitar-making industry, with some guitar manufacturers expressing concerns over the retroactive nature of the Lacey Act and the potential ramifications for older instruments.\n\nThe吉他制造商的行动引起了公众的关注,尤其是那些在1990年代中期开始使用非法木材制作乐器的人。随着对非法砍伐行为的担忧加剧,吉他制造商们开始寻找替代品,如巴西红木和马达加斯加紫檀木。然而,当这些木材来源被证明是非法时,吉他制造商们开始质疑Lacey法案的有效性,并担心他们可能需要证明老式吉他中使用的木材的合法性。\n\nThe Lacey Act, which aims to prevent illegal trade in wildlife and timber, has faced criticism for its potential to hinder legitimate businesses.

This ocean persisted for millions of years, reaching depths of at least 137 meters, and was located primarily in the northern lowlands of the planet. The discovery was made by analyzing the chemical composition of water molecules in the Martian atmosphere, which showed that the planet once harbored a large volume of water, similar to Earth's oceans. The water molecules contained a higher proportion of heavy hydrogen isotopes compared to Earth's water, indicating that Mars had a more extensive and prolonged period of standing water than previously estimated.\n\nThe research team utilized data collected from the Keck II telescope, the Infrared Telescope Facility, and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. These observations revealed that Mars had a global ocean covering approximately 15% of its surface area, with the deepest pools of water concentrated in the northern lowlands. The scientists calculated that Mars had a global ocean covering 1 to 2 meters below the surface, which would have been sufficient to cover the entire planet if evenly distributed. However, due to the planet's unique geological features, the water predominantly accumulated in the northern lowlands, creating a standing body of water that was at least a mile deep in certain areas.\n\nThe team's findings align with earlier studies suggesting that Mars had a more extensive and prolonged period of standing water than previously thought. This discovery adds to the growing evidence that Mars may have been capable of supporting life, as liquid water is essential for biological processes.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The film, directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, follows the story of a veteran con artist named Nicky Spurgeon (played by Smith), who teaches his apprentice, Jess (played by Robbie), the art of the con. The mix of seasoned talent and youthful vigor brings a fresh perspective to the genre, reminiscent of classic films like \"The Freshman\" and \"The Lady Eve.\"\n\nWill Smith, renowned for his cool demeanor and ability to charm his way through life's challenges, embodies the role perfectly. His career began with a bang on the NBC sitcom \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" where he showcased his comedic timing and charisma. However, the actor has faced criticism for his portrayal of a character that doesn't quite resonate with the expectations set by his previous roles, particularly in films that demanded a more stoic and serious demeanor. This has led to a unique challenge for Smith, as he has often been portrayed as a charming rogue rather than a cool and collected mastermind.\n\nThe directorial duo, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, have crafted a film that dares to be small, focusing on the chemistry between Smith and Robbie, who both bring their unique styles to the table. Smith's character, Nicky, is a master of deception, while Robbie portrays Jess, a young and ambitious schemer eager to learn the art of the con. The film explores the dynamics of their partnership, with Smith's character teaching Jess the ins and outs of the game, leading to a thrilling tale filled with intrigue and danger.\n\nWhile the film doesn't delve deeply into the complexities of the plot, it does offer a refreshing take on the genre, blending humor, romance, and suspense. The mix of seasoned talent and youthful energy creates a captivating narrative that keeps viewers engaged, despite the film's lack of depth in explaining the intricate workings of the con. The film's success lies in its ability to entertain, rather than to educate, offering a light-hearted exploration of the world of deception and the allure of the charismatic protagonist.", "answers": ["Will Smith stars as Nicky, an established con man who takes on a new apprentice, Australian newcomer Margot Robbie's Jess, in Focus.

The ruling comes after a series of appeals and counter-appeals between Nestlé and its rival, Mondelez International, which owns the rights to the similar-looking but differently-flavored Norwegian bar, Kvikk Lunsj.\n\nThe European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) had previously rejected Nestlé's trademark claim for the KitKat's distinctive shape, stating that the company had failed to demonstrate that the shape was distinctive in all EU countries. However, Nestlé successfully challenged this decision in 2016, arguing that the shape of the KitKat was widely recognized as distinctive across the EU. The European Court of Justice upheld Nestlé's position, overturning the EUIPO's original rejection of Nestlé's trademark claim.\n\nMondelez, the owner of the Kvikk Lunsj brand, had also contested Nestlé's trademark claim. The court's ruling means that Nestlé's trademark for the distinctive shape of the KitKat bar is nullified, leaving open the possibility for other companies to produce similar-looking products without infringing Nestlé's trademark rights. However, the ruling does not negate the trademark rights for the brand name \"KitKat.\"\n\nThe ruling has implications beyond Nestlé, affecting other multinational companies that operate within the EU. It highlights the complexities of securing trademark protections for products that enjoy widespread popularity across international markets, particularly in the context of the EU's internal market regulations.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

The deal with ICE would consolidate NYSE Euronext's position in the derivatives market, complementing its existing equities and options platforms, and potentially expanding its reach into the fast-growing futures and options trading sectors.\n\nThe transaction would result in a combined entity with a larger footprint in the derivatives space, offering a range of benefits such as increased market share, enhanced operational efficiency, and potential synergies between NYSE Euronext's established presence and ICE's innovative technology and trading infrastructure. The deal, if approved, would likely face scrutiny from regulatory bodies and could encounter challenges from competitors aiming to disrupt the transaction, including the CME Group, which previously expressed interest in acquiring NYSE Euronext in 2011.\n\nThe potential deal, valued at $8.2 billion, would see NYSE Euronext's equities and derivatives businesses merged with ICE's commodities and options trading platforms, creating a dominant force in the global derivatives market. The combined company would also benefit from NYSE Euronext's established presence in Europe and the US, particularly in the over-the-counter trading sector, which could lead to increased profitability and market share growth.\n\nThe potential merger would not only consolidate NYSE Euronext's position in the derivatives market but also leverage the company's existing assets to expand into new sectors, such as commodities and energy trading.

Bayesian statistics, named after the 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, allows for the consideration of various theories and data simultaneously, updating probabilities as new information becomes available. This approach helps to identify the most likely location of a missing object, such as the Air France plane, by considering the probability of different causes, the likelihood of finding the plane in previously searched areas, and the probability of the plane being in specific locations based on historical data and current searches.\n\nIn the case of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Colleen M. Keller and her team at Metron used Bayesian methods to analyze the available data, including the plane's last known location, historical crash data, and the results of previous searches. They created a probability map that indicated the most likely areas to search, which led to the discovery of the plane. However, the team acknowledges that the success of this method depends on the quality of the data and the assumptions made. The Bayesian approach allows for the incorporation of new information and the adjustment of probabilities accordingly, leading to more efficient search operations. While the methods have proven effective in the past, there is no guarantee they will always lead to a successful outcome, especially when dealing with complex and unpredictable environments like the vast oceanic search area for Flight 370. The search for the missing aircraft remains ongoing, with the hope that the Bayesian approach will continue to provide insights and guide the search efforts.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes.

First, a series of three consecutive visible supermoons will be observed, with the first one occurring on December 3rd, followed by another on New Year's Eve, and the third on January 31st. These supermoons are defined as full moons that appear significantly larger due to their proximity to Earth, making them 14% bigger and 14% brighter compared to regular full moons.\n\nThe second major event is a total lunar eclipse that coincides with the second full moon of the month, known as a blue moon, on January 31st. This eclipse will be particularly interesting as it will be visible from various parts of the world, including eastern Asia, the Pacific, and the United States, with the best views from eastern North America and western Europe.\n\nThe total lunar eclipse will begin at 11:48 am UTC on January 31st and reach its peak at 1:30 pm UTC, allowing viewers in the mentioned regions to witness the phenomenon. The eclipse will be especially notable for its blood-red color, resulting from the moon passing through Earth's umbra, the darkest part of the Earth's shadow. This phenomenon, known as a \"blood moon,\" adds to the spectacle of the total lunar eclipse.\n\nThe Virtual Telescope project will provide live streaming of the January 31st eclipse from Australia, and the December 31st supermoon from Rome, offering viewers around the world the chance to experience these celestial events from the comfort of their homes. The live streams will be available on the Virtual Telescope website, providing a unique viewing experience for those unable to observe the phenomena physically.\n\nThe supermoon and the lunar eclipse are not only fascinating to observe but also offer opportunities for photography. To capture these moments, photographers should consider using a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera, ensuring proper exposure and focusing on the moon's movement. For those using smartphones, adjusting the camera settings to balance the exposure and light is recommended.\n\nTo ensure safety, it's important to note that neither the supermoon nor the lunar eclipse requires any special equipment beyond the naked eye.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night.

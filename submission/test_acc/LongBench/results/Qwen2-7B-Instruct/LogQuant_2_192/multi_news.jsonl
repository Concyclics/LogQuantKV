The tax was aimed at reducing sugar consumption, funding education initiatives, and subsidizing healthy food for low-income families. However, the tax has faced criticism for its unintended consequences. In Cook County, Illinois, the tax led to a significant rise in the cost of beverages, with a case of Gatorade increasing by 64% and a case of soda costing 66%. This prompted businesses to direct customers to stores outside the city where the tax wasn't applied. The tax was expected to generate $15 million annually, but it failed to meet its health and revenue goals. The tax was also criticized for disproportionately affecting low-income individuals and businesses, as well as for not addressing the root causes of obesity and diabetes effectively. The tax was seen as regressive, with critics arguing that it would not lead to healthier habits but rather drive people to buy their drinks outside the city limits. The tax was also criticized for not applying to sugar-free drinks, which led to confusion among consumers.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

{"pred": "Colorectal cancer, often considered a disease primarily affecting older men, is increasingly being diagnosed in younger individuals, according to recent studies. A team led by Dr. Samantha Hendre conducted an analysis using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data, finding that 15% of colorectal cancer patients were under 50 years old. These younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer upon diagnosis, with a higher likelihood of having localized or regional tumors spread. They were also more likely to receive aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation, compared to older patients. Despite having more severe cancer, younger patients showed slightly better survival rates, with a slight advantage in the five-year survival rate for localized tumors patients. The study authors suggest that the medical community should reassess screening guidelines, considering the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger populations. However, the ultimate decision to adjust screening recommendations requires further research to determine its impact on overall survival and the potential benefits versus costs. The studies highlight the need for increased awareness and education regarding colorectal cancer symptoms, especially in younger demographics, and the importance of early detection and intervention. The rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger individuals necessitates further investigation into the causes and potential preventive measures, including lifestyle modifications and earlier screening initiatives.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The paper, authored by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermilab and a professor at the University of Chicago, suggests that the only way to prevent the universe from leaving a civilization behind is by harvesting energy from distant stars. This concept, known as the \"Kardashev scale,\" categorizes civilizations based on their energy consumption, with levels ranging from Type I (dominating a single star) to Type II (controlling a galaxy) to Type III (controlling the entire universe). Hooper's paper suggests that as the universe expands, the energy from distant stars will become inaccessible to civilizations, leading to the need for advanced civilizations to create Dyson spheres - vast, energy-harvesting structures - to capture and utilize stellar energy. This could lead to the creation of Dyson swarms, which would orbit a star, effectively harnessing its energy.

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was significantly influenced by environmental changes, particularly in Africa. Three new studies, published in the journal Science, indicate that dramatic shifts in climate and ecology around 300,000 years ago triggered the development of advanced stone tools and trading networks among early humans. This finding challenges the notion that modern behaviors emerged only after the Homo sapiens species appeared around 30,000 years ago. Instead, the research suggests that the Homo genus, including Homo sapiens, responded to the unpredictable food sources resulting from environmental changes by increasing mobility, information sharing, and innovation, leading to the development of trading networks and advanced stone tools. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools at Olorgesaili, dating back to approximately 300,000 years ago, indicates that these advanced technologies and social innovations occurred before the emergence of Homo sapiens. The researchers propose that the development of these technologies was a result of the need to adapt to the changing environment, including the acquisition of exotic materials like obsidian and red pigment, indicating the existence of trade networks and the potential for abstract thinking and innovation. This suggests that the Homo sapiens and their ancestors developed sophisticated tools and trading networks, which could be indicative of advanced cognitive abilities and social structures. The findings also suggest that the Homo sapiens or their close relatives were involved in trading networks and advanced stone tool-making techniques, challenging the traditional view that these developments occurred only after the emergence of Homo sapiens. The study highlights the importance of environmental factors in shaping the evolution of human societies and their cognitive and technological advancements.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation sought to bring Katriuk to justice, but Canada declined, citing the lack of evidence linking him to the atrocities. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish advocacy organization, had called for Katriuk's accountability for the war crimes he was accused of committing.

{"pred": "In recent findings published by NASA, scientists discovered that Mars once had a global ocean covering a significant portion of its surface, similar to Earth's oceans. This discovery was made possible by analyzing the chemical composition of water molecules in the Martian atmosphere, which showed that Mars had a higher concentration of heavy hydrogen (deuterium) compared to Earth's oceans. This indicates that Mars had a substantial amount of water, including a global ocean, which persisted for billions of years before gradually losing its water content due to the thin atmosphere and weaker gravitational pull causing lighter hydrogen to escape into space. The research team led by Geronimo Villanueva concluded that Mars had a global ocean covering approximately 45% of its total land area, reaching depths of around 450 feet (137 meters), primarily concentrated in the northern region of the planet. This ocean would have been more than seven times larger than the current amount of water stored in the polar ice caps. The discovery of this ancient Martian ocean strengthens the possibility of the Red Planet harboring conditions conducive to life, as it suggests that Mars may have possessed a more stable climate and potentially supported biological activity in the distant past. However, the exact nature of the Martian environment during this time and the likelihood of life originating or surviving on Mars remain speculative areas of ongoing investigation.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

By using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, the team was able to reconstruct the visual experiences of subjects watching YouTube videos, creating a computer model that could predict the content of the video based on brain activity patterns. This breakthrough could lead to a deeper understanding of internal mental processes, including dreams, thoughts, and possibly even the ability to recreate visual experiences like dreams or abstract concepts. The researchers believe that this technology could be applied to broadcast internal visual experiences, offering a window into the inner workings of the human mind. However, the researchers caution that the technology is still in its infancy, and further development is needed to fully comprehend the complexities of the brain's visual processing and to decode the precise details of internal visual experiences. The potential applications of this technology include enhancing the understanding of human consciousness, improving the visualization of internal mental states, and even aiding in the control of environments for individuals with disabilities. While the researchers acknowledge the ethical implications of such advancements, they emphasize the importance of continued exploration in understanding the intricacies of the human brain and its capabilities.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

Bayesian statistics, named after the 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, allows for the consideration of various theories and data simultaneously, updating the probabilities as new information emerges. This approach was applied to the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared in 2014. Colleen M. Keller, a senior analyst, and her team at Metron used historical data, crash scenarios, and previous searches to create a probability map for the location of the missing plane. This map helped narrow down the search area significantly, leading to the discovery of the plane wreckage in 2014. However, the search for the missing plane's black box and cockpit voice recorder proved challenging due to the vast search area and the plane's last known location. The statistical methods, however, were successful in pinpointing the location of the plane, which was previously unknown. The search for the missing plane remains ongoing, with the latest theory suggesting that the plane may have been undetected due to the failure of the search teams to listen carefully for the black box signals.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3608}

A source tells UK magazine Look the actor sent Holmes an \"emotional letter\" looking to, at the very least, be friends again, Australia's News Network reports. \"It's like he's finally recognized that Katie will always be the love of his life,\" the source says. Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one.

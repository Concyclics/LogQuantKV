Linne's system of naming species, including humans as Homo sapiens, led to a vast network of connections across Wikipedia, making him the most influential thinker globally. However, the study also revealed that Linne's influence stemmed from the structure of Wikipedia itself, with many entries linking back to Linne's work on species classification. The study's methodology, which combines both incoming and outgoing links, provided a unique way to assess influence. Linne's influence was determined by the sheer volume of connections to his work, making him the most influential thinker in the study.", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person. Second place goes to Michael Jackson, and third to Pope Pius XII. When factoring in all 24 language editions of the online encyclopedia, the team found that Adolf Hitler ranked the most important person, while Michael Jackson was again second and Madonna third, reports the Guardian. \"Our analysis shows that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The show, which is part of the long-running \"Apprentice\" franchise, saw a ratings decline compared to the most recent season hosted by Donald Trump. The episode, which aired on NBC, attracted around 4.9 million total viewers, marking a significant drop from the previous season's ratings, which averaged about 7.6 million viewers. This decline was noticeable when compared to the premiere of \"The Bachelor,\" which drew in nearly 6.6 million viewers, and other programming on CBS and ABC. \n\nThe network had anticipated a strong performance from the show, especially considering the promotional efforts leading up to Schwarzenegger's hosting debut. However, the ratings were overshadowed by the success of \"The Bachelor\" and the college football game between Penn State and USC. \n\nDespite the less-than-anticipated ratings, NBC's \"The Wall\" managed to maintain a strong lead-in, providing a solid audience for the subsequent program.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

A study by Dr. Samantha Hendre and her team revealed that 15% of colorectal cancer cases occur in people below 50, with these patients more likely to have advanced-stage cancer upon diagnosis. The study, published in the journal Cancer, analyzed data from 258,000 colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2011. Younger patients were more likely to receive aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation, and had slightly better survival rates compared to older patients. However, the study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendre, emphasized that it's unclear whether altering screening guidelines to start at a younger age would improve outcomes, as the impact of early detection on survival is uncertain. The study also suggested that younger patients might benefit from earlier screening, but the decision to adjust screening recommendations requires further research and consideration of the potential benefits and risks. Dr. Andrew Chan, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted that while the increase in younger patients with colorectal cancer is concerning, the exact causes remain unknown, and more research is needed to understand the environmental and lifestyle factors potentially contributing to this trend.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

But \"maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with Detroit is the point.\" Chris Klimek says Detroit is \"maddeningly imperfect but still honorable,\" citing \"lightly fictionalized\" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up \"for maximum outrage.\" This is \"messy work, even when it’s done in good faith,\" he writes at NPR.

{"pred": "In recent astronomical research, a new perspective on galactic expansion and the potential for alien megastructures has emerged. The concept of galactic domination, originally proposed by astronom Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, has been revisited with a new apocalyptic twist. Kardashev's three levels of galactic expansion—Type I, II, and III—have been extended by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermilab and the University of Chicago. Hooper suggests that, in the face of the expansion of dark energy, which is causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate, advanced civilizations might harness the energy of distant stars to ensure their survival. This is a new take on the original Kardashev scale, which posits that civilizations will attempt to control the energy of their own star, and possibly others, to ensure their existence in the face of the expansion of the universe. This is a response to the inevitable expansion of the universe, which is causing the stars in the Local Group to recede, making them inaccessible to any future civilizations. Hooper's theory suggests that advanced civilizations, such as those in the Type III category, will create Dyson spheres, which are megastructures that surround a star, to capture its energy. This Dyson sphere would be made up of numerous satellites, each of which would be able to harness the energy of a star. The energy from these satellites would be directed towards a Dyson sphere, which would then be used to power the civilization's megastructures. This theory aligns with the idea of advanced civilizations controlling the energy of their star to ensure their survival in the face of the expansion of the universe. This concept has been explored in science fiction, such as in the 1930s novel \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" and the 1970 novel \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\"\n\nIn a separate development, a team of researchers has suggested that Dyson's original concept of a Dyson sphere, a megastructure that surrounds a star, could be used to capture the energy of a star and transport it to a Dyson sphere, which is a megastructure that surrounds a star and captures its energy.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The overarching goal is to mitigate against the inevitable decay of online information due to website redesigns, removals, or obsolescence.\n\nSimultaneously, tragedy unfolds amidst the serene landscapes of rural America, as exemplified by the grim incident involving Deputy Jack Hopkins of the Modoc County Sheriff's Department. On October 19th, Hopkins was tragically slain during his duty, responding to a disturbance call. His entry into a property located approximately eight miles south of Altar, Modoc County, proved fatal as he was ambushed and fatally shot by an individual identified as Jack Lee Brein. The incident escalated further when Hopkins' colleague, in pursuit of the perpetrator, engaged in a confrontation with Jack Lee Brein, resulting in a second shooting incident. The situation underscores the inherent risks faced by law enforcement personnel in their line of duty.\n\nIn a separate yet equally distressing event, the case of Jack Lee Brein escalates dramatically. Not only is he charged with the murder of Deputy Jack Hopkins, but he also faces additional charges stemming from the subsequent confrontation with another deputy, leading to a second shooting incident.

{"pred": "In the world of American politics, several key events and statements have emerged, shaping the landscape of the ongoing campaigns and policy discussions. In the realm of the Republican primary race, the focus has shifted to the tactics and strategies employed by candidates, particularly regarding the use of 'straw polls' at events like the CPAC convention. Rick Santorum, a candidate in the race, expressed skepticism about the fairness of the CPAC straw poll results, suggesting that some candidates might manipulate the process by paying for attendees' tickets, thereby influencing the outcome. He further stated that his campaign did not engage in such practices, implying that other campaigns might have done so. This claim was met with a swift rebuttal from the Romney campaign, which denied any wrongdoing and highlighted their victory in the CPAC poll, as well as their success in the Maine caucuses. The discussion around the integrity of these events and the potential influence of campaign funding on voter turnout continues to be a focal point in the political discourse.\n\nIn another development, the race for the Republican nomination saw a shift in rhetoric, with Rick Santorum's comments sparking a debate on the nature of conservatism. Santorum, while discussing the CPAC poll, brought attention to the practice of attendees voting in large numbers for candidates like Ron Paul, who often fund their own ticket to the convention, potentially skewing the results. He argued that his campaign's approach was different, focusing on genuine support rather than financial incentives.\n\nOn the issue of contraception, the White House and its allies engaged in a heated exchange with the Catholic community. President Obama's administration faced criticism from the Catholic Church over the president's stance on contraception, with White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew defending the administration's position. Lew clarified that the president's accommodation for religious organizations, aimed at addressing concerns over contraceptive coverage, was consistent with previous positions. He emphasized that the president's approach was designed to ensure that insurance companies would bear the cost of contraceptives, potentially reducing overall healthcare expenses. This was seen as a strategic move to address the concerns of religious groups while maintaining the president's commitment to providing access to reproductive health services.\n\nIn summary, the week's news highlights the ongoing debates within the Republican Party regarding the use of 'straw polls' and the nature of conservatism, as well as the complex relationship between the Obama administration and the Catholic Church over issues of reproductive rights and accommodation policies.

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was significantly influenced by environmental changes, particularly in Africa. Three new studies, published in the journal Science, indicate that dramatic shifts in climate and ecology around 300,000 years ago triggered the development of advanced stone tools and trading networks among early humans, suggesting that the emergence of Homo sapiens was preceded by a long history of adaptation and innovation. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools at Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, dating back to approximately 300,000 years ago, challenges previous assumptions that such tools appeared suddenly around 160,000 years ago. The researchers argue that the advanced tool technology and trade networks observed in the region were a result of the need to adapt to the environment, rather than a sudden leap in cognitive abilities. The study also suggests that the use of exotic materials, such as red ochre pigment, indicates the existence of symbolic and artistic expression in early Homo sapiens.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

However, he underwent groundbreaking surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where doctors harvested cartilage from his ribs to create new ears. The operation, led by plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, took place over six hours and involved removing six ribs to create the new ears. Kieran's confidence and social interactions improved significantly following the surgery, and he expressed excitement about his new appearance. The procedure, while primarily cosmetic, has been shown to improve the psychological well-being of the patients, as it can alter their self-esteem and social interactions. Kieran's parents were pleased with the outcome, and they hoped for further advancements in medical technology, such as creating new ears from a child's own stem cells, which could potentially be achieved through a less invasive process in the future. Kieran's mother, Louise, expressed her delight at the operation, stating that it had given her son a new lease on life and improved his self-esteem. She also mentioned that Kieran was now more confident and had made new friends in his new school, which had a deafness support unit for students with hearing impairments. Kieran's father, David, said that the operation had been a success and that Kieran was now more confident and had more friends.

Federal marshals conducted raids on Gibson’s facilities in Tennessee, seizing wood shipments suspected of being illegally harvested. This action stemmed from Gibson’s alleged involvement in a supply chain linked to illegal timber extraction, which violated the Lacey Act—a law designed to prevent the trade in illegally logged wildlife and plant products.\n\nThe Gibson controversy escalated when the company’s CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claimed that the government failed to provide evidence of wrongdoing against his company, leading to substantial losses and a lack of recourse in the judicial system. Gibson’s attorney confirmed that the company had ceased acquiring wood from Madagascar in 2009, but the ongoing investigation and potential retroactive implications of the Lacey Act raised concerns among the guitar-making industry and environmentalists alike.\n\nThe Lacey Act, enacted in 2008, required companies using endangered wood to ensure the legality of their supply chains, tracing back to the origin of the wood. Gibson faced accusations from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) that they knowingly engaged in illegal activities, including a trip to Madagascar to assess the possibility of sourcing illegally from that country. However, Gibson maintained that their wood purchases complied with both U.S. and Malayan laws.\n\nIn response to the legal challenges, Gibson’s attorney argued that the company had provided evidence of legal wood from India, and that the吉他 maker had taken proactive measures to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The吉他 maker industry rallied around Gibson’s plight, expressing concerns over the retroactive nature of the Lacey Act and the potential for guitar makers’s to face similar legal repercussions.\n\nThe guitar industry, including notable manufacturers like Martin, expressed support for the Lacey Act, emphasizing the importance of reducing illegal logging practices. However, the act’s implementation has sparked unintended consequences, such as the guitar makers’s inability to trace the legality of their wood sources and the potential for guitar makers’s to face legal scrutiny for actions taken years prior.\n\nThe吉他 industry’s response to the Gibson case highlighted the need for clarity in the legal framework surrounding the trade in wood and the potential for unintended consequences of the Lacey Act.

{"pred": "In recent findings published by NASA, scientists have uncovered that Mars once had a global ocean covering a significant portion of its surface, providing new insights into the planet's potential for harboring life. Using data from the most powerful telescopes available, researchers discovered that Mars had a substantial ocean covering nearly 15% of its surface area, which was likely in existence billions of years ago. The discovery was made by analyzing the chemical composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, revealing that the planet once had a large amount of water, including a significant portion of it being in liquid form. This suggests that Mars may have been a warm and wet environment, similar to the conditions on Earth during the prehistoric era. However, the research indicates that Mars lost its water over time due to the thin atmosphere and weaker gravitational pull, leading to the formation of a large ocean covering a significant part of the planet's surface.\n\nThe research team, led by Geronimo Villanueva, employed advanced telescopes to measure the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere. By comparing the chemical composition of water vapor on Mars to that of Earth, scientists were able to determine that Mars once had a global ocean covering a significant portion of its surface. The team found that the water vapor contained a higher concentration of deuterium, indicating that Mars had a larger amount of water compared to Earth. The team concluded that Mars had a global ocean covering a significant portion of its surface, which would have been approximately 1 kilometer deep.\n\nHowever, the team acknowledged that their findings might underestimate the actual amount of water that Mars once possessed. This is because the planet's atmosphere was unusually high in deuterium, suggesting that the planet lost a considerable amount of water over time. The team believes that the planet's ocean would have been larger if it had remained intact, and the liquid water would have been more extensive, potentially covering a larger portion of the planet's surface.\n\nThe research team also noted that the planet's water vapor contained a higher concentration of deuterium compared to Earth, implying that Mars had a larger proportion of water vapor in its atmosphere. This information provides valuable insights into the planet's past environmental conditions and the possibility of habitability. However, the team cautioned that their findings might underestimate the total amount of water that Mars had once possessed, emphasizing the importance of further exploration and analysis to uncover the full extent of Mars' watery past.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

He charms.\" There's also \"combustible chemistry\" between Smith and Robbie, but the movie just \"disappoints,\" Rea writes. \"Even if you're willing to forgive its sinkhole plotholes and farthest-fetched conceits, the film ... ultimately makes no sense.\" Betsy Sharkey, on the other hand, says this \"rom-com-con\" is \"an irresistible reminder of all the reasons we first fell for the Fresh Prince so many years ago.\" Writing at the Los Angeles Times, she notes the romantic role of Nicky fits Smith perfectly, while Robbie is \"more than holding her own\" as his match. \"The scams are Rubik's Cube complicated, but what keeps you guessing is whether the romantic connection between Jess and Nicky is real or just another con.\" But Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle isn't convinced. In a review titled \"Will Smith just stole $12 from your pocket,\" he argues Focus is \"ridiculous in every detail. It's a movie with no truth that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it.\" Nicky and Jess lack \"impact,\" partly because \"Smith is not a strong leading man,\" he says.

The research suggests that dinosaurs, like birds, may have made sounds through a closed mouth, a process known as \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" These sounds are often low-pitched and can be produced by birds with a relatively large body, such as pigeons, doves, and cassowaries. The researchers analyzed the vocalizing patterns of 200 different bird species, finding that closed-mouth vocalizations occurred in 16% of the species studied. The study also suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved at least 16 times in the history of birds and crocodiles, indicating that this behavior emerged in multiple lineages. The researchers believe that dinosaurs, being part of the same group as birds and crocodiles, may have made sounds similar to birds, but with a closed mouth, potentially creating a unique, low-frequency vocalization. While the study does not provide definitive proof of dinosaur vocalization, it suggests that dinosaurs may have made sounds akin to those of birds, but with a closed beak, possibly during mating displays or territorial defense. The study's findings imply that dinosaurs may have made sounds that were low-pitched and possibly even \"booming\" in nature, similar to the sounds of birds like the cooing of a dove or the grunting of an ostrich.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

The Shroud, which bears the image of a crucified man, has been the subject of extensive scrutiny and analysis since the 13th century. The research team, led by Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, used blood flow patterns to analyze the bloodstain patterns on the Shroud. They found that the bloodstains on the Shroud do not align with the expected blood flow patterns for a person lying on their back, suggesting that the bloodstains were not produced by a person lying on their back, as would be expected for a traditional burial practice.

This conclusion adds to the growing body of evidence questioning the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, which has been the subject of intense scientific and religious scrutiny for centuries.

The organization highlights the success stories from countries like Moldova, Bulgaria, and the Czech Republic, where the number of children in institutions has significantly decreased, indicating the possibility of eradicating institutionalized care globally by 2050.\n\nLumos emphasizes that ending institutional care is not only a moral obligation but also economically beneficial, as it leads to better outcomes for children and communities. The organization advocates for a shift in focus from institutional care to family-based care, which is more cost-effective and promotes children's well-being and development. International and public support plays a crucial role in this transformation, with the potential to eradicate institutional care in the near future. The awareness campaign, #Letstalklumos, encourages engagement and action towards this goal, aiming to change the narrative surrounding institutionalized children and their families.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them. Rowling wants to change that, not by improving these orphanages with \"pretty murals\" or teddy bears, but by eliminating them altogether, she writes in the Guardian. The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

It's recommended to carefully consider the costs before applying for such loans, and to only take them if absolutely necessary. \n\nIn addition, the article discusses the availability of online applications for these loans, which can save time and effort by allowing applicants to fill out the form and submit it directly from their computer. This process can be done from anywhere, providing convenience for those who might not have access to traditional banking services. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that these loans are not suitable for everyone. Applicants should ensure they meet the eligibility criteria, such as having a steady income, a bank account, and meeting the minimum age requirement. Furthermore, the loans are typically short-term, with repayment periods ranging from one to four weeks, and should be used judiciously to avoid falling into debt traps. \n\nIn conclusion, while these loans can provide a quick fix for financial emergencies, it's crucial to understand the potential risks involved and to use them responsibly. It's always wise to explore other options, like savings or budgeting, before resorting to such loans.", "answers": ["As everyone wonders whether Conan O’Brien will stay at NBC or move to Fox, the Tonight Show host offered up a few more novel ideas yesterday: Perhaps he’ll “pretend to put my son in a giant foil balloon, then sit back and watch the offers come pouring in!” Watch him deliver the rest of his options on the video above—then check out Jay Leno, who also addressed the drama last night on his show. “NBC says the show performed exactly as they expected it would, and then they canceled it,” Leno said. “Now don’t confuse that with when we were on at late night and we performed better than expected and then they canceled us.

This marked the first time in BP's history that shareholders voted against executive pay packages, indicating a growing discontent with corporate pay practices. BP's chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, acknowledged the strong backlash and vowed to reconsider the company's approach to executive compensation, stating that the board would engage in discussions with major shareholders to understand their concerns regarding the pay structure.

The company's poor financial performance, exacerbated by the ongoing oil price downturn, contributed to the decision to cut thousands of jobs globally. Despite this, BP's pay policy was deemed excessive by some stakeholders, leading to a shareholder revolt.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

In an interview with New Zealand's TV3, Clinton acknowledged that the United States might be ready for a female president, but she is not the one. She further clarified that she is very satisfied with her current position as Secretary of State and is not considering any future presidential runs. \n\nThe New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key, inadvertently referred to Clinton as \"President Clinton\" during a meeting, which led to a brief moment of laughter and a quick correction by Key. Clinton used this opportunity to defend President Barack Obama, emphasizing that his decisions, though unpopular, were necessary for the country's well-being. She highlighted the importance of the stimulus package, which, despite its unpopularity, was deemed crucial for the economy. Clinton also mentioned that the mid-term elections' results, which saw the Republicans gaining seats in the House of Representatives, were not unexpected and are part of the political landscape. Clinton's focus remains on her current duties as Secretary of State, and she expressed confidence in the ability of the United States to elect a female president in the future. \n\nIn summary, Clinton's visit to New Zealand coincided with her ruling out a potential 2016 presidential bid, and her defense of President Obama's decisions, despite their unpopularity, in light of the recent midterm elections.", "answers": ["A day after being accidentally introduced as \"President Clinton,\" Hillary seems to be taking pains to kill talk of a future run in New Zealand's media, reports Reuters.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The policy, outlined by Netflix's Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz, aims to provide employees with the flexibility and support they need to balance the demands of work and family life, particularly during the critical first year of a child's life. The policy is designed to help employees focus on their growing families without the worry of work or financial concerns, and it aligns with Netflix's \"freedom and responsibility\" culture, which values employee autonomy and performance. The policy is intended to attract and retain top talent, especially in light of the growing importance of work-life balance for employees. The move comes after a trend of tech companies offering more generous parental leave policies, such as doubling maternity and paternity leave in 2013 by Yahoo, to remain competitive with other firms. The policy is expected to be a significant factor in supporting employees' growth and performance, as well as their overall well-being. However, some critics argue that unlimited leave policies may lead to challenges in managing workload and team dynamics, similar to concerns raised by unlimited time-off policies.", "answers": ["Expecting parents wondering which company offers the best maternity and paternity leave in the US need look no further.

The new policy \"deserves high marks for extending leave to fathers,\" reports Fortune, \"as well as understanding that the entire first year after childbirth can be challenging.\" It's a \"landmark perk,\" reports TechCrunch, noting that Yahoo doubled its maternity and paternity leave in 2013 (to 16 paid weeks for moms and eight paid weeks for dads) to compete with packages offered by Facebook and Google because \"the talent is growing up.\" A decade ago big company perks included free lunch and ping pong tables, but now the major moves are about helping employees balance work and home life because \"experience shows people perform better at work when they’re not worrying about home,\" Cranz adds.

This hypothetical celestial body, estimated to be between 10 and 20 times the size of Earth, is believed to reside beyond the orbit of Neptune, potentially 200-300 astronomical units (AU) away from the Sun. The existence of Planet Nine is supported by the observed clustering of smaller, icy objects in the outer solar system, which indicate the presence of a massive, distant planet influencing their orbits.\n\nCaltech researchers, including Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have developed a theory that this planet, named \"Planet Nine,\" exerts a gravitational pull causing the orbits of the smaller bodies to exhibit a peculiar pattern. The existence of Planet Nine is considered likely by some experts, but confirmation remains elusive. The possibility of direct observation is uncertain due to the planet's immense distance from the Sun. However, the researchers believe that Planet Nine's discovery could revolutionize our understanding of the solar system's structure.\n\nMike Brown, a key figure in the Pluto demotion controversy, has been actively involved in the search for Planet Nine. He has not shied away from the title of \"Pluto Killer,\" which he uses humorously to emphasize the need for a clear distinction between the major planets and the smaller, more numerous objects in the outer solar system. Brown's book, \"How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming,\" reflects his willingness to challenge traditional classifications and definitions.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine continues, with the possibility of redefining the solar system's composition.

The search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with the potential to reshape our understanding of the outer solar system and the nature of planets.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The study also suggested that younger patients might benefit from earlier screening, but the decision to adjust screening recommendations requires further research and consideration of the potential benefits and risks. Dr. Andrew Chan, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted that while the increase in younger patients with colorectal cancer is concerning, the exact causes remain unknown, and more research is needed to understand the environmental and lifestyle factors potentially contributing to this trend. Dr. Andrew Chan also highlighted the importance of considering the rising number of younger patients with colorectal cancer, especially those with a family history, and the need for more research on the long-term effects of early detection and treatment on younger patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "In recent astronomical research, a new perspective on galactic expansion and the potential for alien megastructures has emerged. The concept of galactic domination, originally proposed by astronom Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, has been revisited with a new apocalyptic twist. Kardashev's three levels of galactic expansion—Type I, II, and III—have been extended by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermilab and the University of Chicago. Hooper suggests that, in the face of the expansion of dark energy, which is causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate, advanced civilizations might harness the energy of distant stars to ensure their survival. This is a new take on the original Kardashev scale, which posits that civilizations will attempt to control the energy of their own star, and possibly others, to ensure their existence in the face of the expansion of the universe. This is a response to the inevitable expansion of the universe, which is causing the stars in the Local Group to recede, making them inaccessible to any future civilizations. Hooper's theory suggests that advanced civilizations, such as those in the Type III category, will create Dyson spheres, which are megastructures that surround a star, to capture its energy. This Dyson sphere would be made up of numerous satellites, each of which would be able to harness the energy of a star. The energy from these satellites would be directed towards a Dyson sphere, which would then be used to power the civilization's megastructures. This theory aligns with the idea of advanced civilizations controlling the energy of their star to ensure their survival in the face of the expansion of the universe. This concept has been explored in science fiction, such as in the 1930s novel \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" and the 1970 novel \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\"\n\nIn a separate development, a team of researchers has suggested that Dyson's original concept of a Dyson sphere, a megastructure that surrounds a star, could be used to capture the energy of a star and transport it to a Dyson sphere, which is a megastructure that surrounds a star and captures its energy.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

In the realm of the Republican primary race, the focus has shifted to the tactics and strategies employed by candidates, particularly regarding the use of 'straw polls' at events like the CPAC convention. Rick Santorum, a candidate in the race, expressed skepticism about the fairness of the CPAC straw poll results, suggesting that some candidates might manipulate the process by paying for attendees' tickets, thereby influencing the outcome. He further stated that his campaign did not engage in such practices, implying that other campaigns might have done so. This claim was met with a swift rebuttal from the Romney campaign, which denied any wrongdoing and highlighted their victory in the CPAC poll, as well as their success in the Maine caucuses. The discussion around the integrity of these events and the potential influence of campaign funding on voter turnout continues to be a focal point in the political discourse.\n\nIn another development, the race for the Republican nomination saw a shift in rhetoric, with Rick Santorum's comments sparking a debate on the nature of conservatism. Santorum, while discussing the CPAC poll, brought attention to the practice of attendees voting in large numbers for candidates like Ron Paul, who often fund their own ticket to the convention, potentially skewing the results. He argued that his campaign's approach was different, focusing on genuine support rather than financial incentives.\n\nOn the issue of contraception, the White House and its allies engaged in a heated exchange with the Catholic community. President Obama's administration faced criticism from the Catholic Church over the president's stance on contraception, with White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew defending the administration's position. Lew clarified that the president's accommodation for religious organizations, aimed at addressing concerns over contraceptive coverage, was consistent with previous positions. He emphasized that the president's approach was designed to ensure that insurance companies would bear the cost of contraceptives, potentially reducing overall healthcare expenses. This was seen as a strategic move to address the concerns of religious groups while maintaining the president's commitment to providing access to reproductive health services.\n\nIn summary, the week's news highlights the ongoing debates within the Republican Party regarding the use of 'straw polls' and the nature of conservatism, as well as the complex relationship between the Obama administration and the Catholic Church over issues of reproductive rights and accommodation policies.

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was significantly influenced by environmental changes, particularly in Africa. Three new studies, published in the journal Science, indicate that dramatic shifts in climate and ecology around 300,000 years ago triggered the development of advanced stone tools and trading networks among early humans, suggesting that the emergence of Homo sapiens was preceded by a long history of adaptation and innovation. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools at Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, dating back to approximately 300,000 years ago, challenges previous assumptions that such tools appeared suddenly around 160,000 years ago. The researchers argue that the advanced tool technology and trade networks observed in the region were a result of the need to adapt to the environment, rather than a sudden leap in cognitive abilities. The study also suggests that the use of exotic materials, such as red ochre pigment, indicates the existence of symbolic and artistic expression in early Homo sapiens.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

In his rally in Franklin, Tennessee, Trump expressed his support for the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense, citing the need for self-defense in the face of potential threats. He mentioned his handgun carry permit in New York and compared himself to the character played by Charles Bronson in the movie \"Death Wish\", suggesting that having a permit and being prepared for self-defense could deter attackers. Trump emphasized the importance of mental health in relation to gun control, stating that the root of the problem lies in the individuals themselves, not the laws. He also mentioned that the presence of \"gun-free zones\" might have contributed to the situation in Oregon, as he believes that if instructors or students were armed, the outcome could have been different. Trump's positions on gun control have evolved, with him now advocating for mental health care and self-defense rights. He criticized the idea of increasing gun control measures, arguing that the main issue is mental health, not the availability of firearms. He also mentioned his stance on the upcoming primaries, particularly Super Tuesday, and how he plans to address the concerns raised by the media regarding his potential impact on the election results.\n\nIn a separate interview, Trump highlighted the need for increased transportation efficiency, specifically in the context of roads, and suggested that the current methods of construction and maintenance are inefficient. He also addressed the criticism of his potential loss in a general election, emphasizing that he has the ability to save costs through his approach to road construction, which he believes would result in better infrastructure at a lower cost. \n\nIn summary, the news covered Donald Trump's evolving stances on gun control, his focus on self-defense and mental health, and his views on the cost and efficiency of infrastructure projects, including road construction.

{"pred": "In recent findings published by NASA, scientists have uncovered that Mars once had a global ocean covering a significant portion of its surface, providing new insights into the planet's potential for harboring life. Using data from the most powerful telescopes available, researchers discovered that Mars had a substantial ocean covering nearly 15% of its surface area, which was likely in existence billions of years ago. The discovery was made by analyzing the chemical composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, revealing that the planet once had a large amount of water, including a significant portion of it being in liquid form. This suggests that Mars may have been a warm and wet environment, similar to the conditions on Earth during the prehistoric era. However, the research indicates that Mars lost its water over time due to the thin atmosphere and weaker gravitational pull, leading to the formation of a large ocean covering a significant part of the planet's surface.\n\nThe research team, led by Geronimo Villanueva, employed advanced telescopes to measure the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere. By comparing the chemical composition of water vapor on Mars to that of Earth, scientists were able to determine that Mars once had a global ocean covering a significant portion of its surface. The team found that the water vapor contained a higher concentration of deuterium, indicating that Mars had a larger amount of water compared to Earth. The team concluded that Mars had a global ocean covering a significant portion of its surface, which would have been approximately 1 kilometer deep.\n\nHowever, the team acknowledged that their findings might underestimate the actual amount of water that Mars once possessed. This is because the planet's atmosphere was unusually high in deuterium, suggesting that the planet lost a considerable amount of water over time. The team believes that the planet's ocean would have been larger if it had remained intact, and the liquid water would have been more extensive, potentially covering a larger portion of the planet's surface.\n\nThe research team also noted that the planet's water vapor contained a higher concentration of deuterium compared to Earth, implying that Mars had a larger proportion of water vapor in its atmosphere. This information provides valuable insights into the planet's past environmental conditions and the possibility of habitability. However, the team cautioned that their findings might underestimate the total amount of water that Mars had once possessed, emphasizing the importance of further exploration and analysis to uncover the full extent of Mars' watery past.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Bayesian statistics, named after the 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, allows for the consideration of various scenarios and the incorporation of new information, making it a powerful tool for complex search operations.\n\nIn 2009, Air France Flight 447 vanished, and the search for the plane and its black boxes was extensive but fruitless. However, a team of statisticians, led by Colleen M. Keller, used Bayesian methods to analyze the available data, including historical crash statistics, the location of the last known position of the plane, and the probability of the plane being in specific areas based on the search history. This approach allowed them to narrow down the search area significantly, leading to the discovery of the plane wreckage in 2011.\n\nThe Bayesian approach, which considers all available data and updates the probabilities as new information emerges, proved effective in the Air France case. The method allowed for the combination of various pieces of information, including historical data on crashes, the location of the last known position, and the probability of finding the plane in different areas. By factoring in the probability of finding the plane in different locations based on previous searches, the team was able to identify the most probable location for the wreckage.\n\nThe search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has utilized similar statistical methods, but the search area is vast, and the probability of finding the plane is influenced by various factors, including the likelihood of deliberate action causing the disappearance. While the statistical methods have helped to focus the search, the search for Flight 370 remains challenging due to the complexity of the situation and the lack of clear information about the cause of the disappearance.\n\nThe search for Flight 370 continues, with the probability of finding the plane decreasing as the search progresses. The statistical methods have proven useful in narrowing down the search area, but the search for the plane remains challenging, especially considering the vastness of the search area and the potential for the plane to be located in areas that have already been searched.

How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "On Wednesday evening in Mendon, a Toyota Corolla driven by Nabila Altahan, following a sudden change in direction due to a GPS error, collided with a telephone guy wire. The incident occurred when the vehicle, heading west on Route 4, passed its intended destination and the GPS system instructed a U-turn, causing Altahan to react swiftly. Unfortunately, the car left the road and became suspended from the telephone pole wire, but miraculously, no injuries were reported for either the driver or the passenger.\n\nThe incident was witnessed by someone at a nearby miniature golf course, who noted that the driver managed to escape the vehicle before it came to rest on the wire. The accident was reported to the police, who arrived along with the Rutland City Fire Department. The incident, captured by a passerby, Ray Ault, highlights the potential dangers of relying solely on GPS systems during driving, especially in situations where quick reactions can lead to unexpected outcomes.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP.

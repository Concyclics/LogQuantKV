Dickson Wright was a controversial figure, known for her opinions on hunting and her support for the Countryside Alliance. She was also a fierce advocate for the rights of the countryside, and she was involved in various campaigns for the protection of the environment. Dickson Wright was a complex character, with a colorful past that included a troubled childhood, a battle with alcohol, and a love for the countryside.

The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\" It wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously. As for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame? \"If you're fat you're fat,\" she once said. \"I hate this modern-day political correctness, that you don't call things by their proper name.\" Her agent remembers Wright similarly in a statement: \"Loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, Clarissa was utterly non-PC and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost.\" There's no word on Wright's cause of death, but the Guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2870}

They chose to avoid the crowded summit and instead attempted to descend via the west face of the mountain, using Gary's smartphone and a navigation app to find a safe route. Unfortunately, Jane fell 30 feet down a steep, rocky slope, tumbling 150 feet further down the mountain. Gary managed to raise an emergency call after realizing the severity of the situation. The rescue team, led by the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue, found Jane's body in an area known for its loose rocks and steep inclines. The cause of death was determined to be an accident, with the coroner noting that the app's route choice and footwear contributed to the fatal tumble.

This comes after the Democrats' loss in the recent US mid-term elections, where the Republicans gained a significant number of seats in the House of Representatives.

{"pred": "Col Initialise the colon cancer screening at age 50, the age at which doctors recommend starting regular screenings, is being reconsidered due to a growing number of younger people being diagnosed with the disease. A study found that one in seven colon and rectal cancers are diagnosed in individuals under 50, with these patients often presenting with more advanced stages of the disease. This is attributed to the fact that these patients are diagnosed later in their lives, often only after symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel movements, or pain have appeared. The study, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendren, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Michigan, analyzed data from 1998 to 2011, finding that 15% of colon and rectal cancers were diagnosed in individuals under 50. These patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, but they were also more likely to receive aggressive treatment, such as surgery and radiation, compared to older patients. Despite having more severe forms of the disease, younger patients were found to have slightly better survival rates than older patients. The study suggests that the current screening guidelines might need to be reconsidered, especially for those with a family history of colon cancer, to potentially improve outcomes and survival rates.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

{"pred": "Recent studies have revealed that the evolution of human behavior and technological advancements occurred much earlier than previously thought, challenging the notion that modern human characteristics emerged solely with Homo sapiens. Three new papers in the journal Science have uncovered dramatic shifts in the East African climate that may have driven the development of advanced cognitive and trading abilities among early humans. The research indicates that around 300,000 years ago, the environment in the region became increasingly unpredictable due to climate change, leading to the need for information sharing, resource gathering, and innovation. This resulted in the emergence of Middle Stone Age tools, which began around 320,000 years ago, earlier than previously estimated. These tools, made from a variety of materials, including exotic materials like obsidian, suggest that early humans engaged in trading and foraging for resources over long distances. The discovery of red and black pigments, likely used for trade and symbolic purposes, adds to the evidence of early human social and cognitive developments. The findings support the idea that the evolution of modern human behavior, including tool use and trading, occurred much earlier than previously believed, challenging the Eurocentric view that modern human behavior emerged exclusively with Homo sapiens. The research highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay between environmental changes and human adaptation, suggesting that the evolution of modern human traits and innovations occurred much earlier than previously thought.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Hooper, a veteran teacher, had been warned that Cruz was a troublemaker, often causing disruptions in class due to his frequent outbursts and his history of physical and emotional abuse at home. However, Hooper's perspective changed dramatically when she realized Cruz's background and the impact of his home environment on his behavior. She started to see Cruz's potential beyond his initial reputation and began to care for him deeply. Hooper started allowing Cruz to help her with various tasks in the classroom, and he began to show improvement in his behavior and attitude. Hooper and her husband, Gale, started providing Cruz with a stable home environment, offering him a safe space away from the abuse he faced at home. This led to a strong bond between Cruz and the Hoopers, and Cruz spent most weekends and holidays with them. \n\nHooper's heart softened towards Cruz, and she began to see him as her own. Hooper's love and support transformed Cruz's life, helping him overcome his troubled past and find a new path forward. He eventually asked Hooper to adopt him, and in 1998, Hooper and her husband Gale adopted Cruz, legally making him their son. This adoption marked a significant turning point in Cruz's life, as he was able to embrace his true identity and form a lasting bond with his new family. Cruz's transformation from a troubled youth to a beloved member of the Hooper family highlights the power of love and understanding in transforming lives.", "answers": ["Cruz Riojas came from a troubled home: He was reportedly beaten by his stepfather, lived in a decrepit one-room lean-to with six other family members, and wore the same clothes to school every day, according to the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal.

But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated. More than a decade later, he was still part of the Hooper family—but he wanted to make it official by asking the Hoopers to adopt him right before his 30th birthday. “He said he wanted to honor us, and it was a big honor,\" Hooper tells Today. \"I’ve always known he loved me, but this really showed he loved us.” The adoption went through in 1998, but Cruz \"was my son from the day I kept him,” Hooper says.

Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, expressed frustration at the lack of clarity regarding the alleged violations of the law by Gibson, stating that the company's reputation and operations have suffered significant damage.

Gibson maintains that all its purchases from Madagascar have been in compliance with both U.S. and Malayan laws.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

{"pred": "In毫无疑�, a study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaurs may have made sounds that were similar to those of modern birds, such as cooing and muffled vocalizations, rather than the loud roars depicted in movies. The study, which analyzed the evolution of vocalization in birds, found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are often heard in birds, originated at least 16 times in the evolutionary history of birds and crocodiles. These vocalizations are often associated with mating displays, and the researchers suggest that dinosaurs, being part of the same group as birds and crocodiles, may have also made similar vocalizations, particularly in mating contexts. The study's lead author, Chad Eliason, noted that the ability to make these sounds is more likely to have evolved in species with larger bodies, such as the long-tailed flightless birds, which are known for their distinctive vocalizations. The study's findings imply that dinosaurs, being part of the same group, may have had the capacity to make similar vocalizations, though no direct evidence of dinosaur vocalization currently exists. The study's authors suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization, which involves the inflation of the neck muscles to generate low-frequency sounds, may have been present in some dinosaurs, allowing them to make sounds akin to those of today's birds and crocodiles, suggesting that dinosaurs might have been capable of producing similar vocalizations, including the possibility of making sounds that could be described as \"muffled\" or \"hushed,\" similar to the cooing of a dove or the grunting of an ostr\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, suggests that the evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations occurred multiple times in the lineage leading to modern birds and reptiles, including dinosaurs. The researchers analyzed the vocalization patterns of 200 species of birds and found that the ability to make these sounds arose at least 16 times in the evolutionary tree, with the largest species being more likely to develop this type of vocalization. The researchers suggest that dinosaurs, being part of the same group as birds and reptiles, may have had the capacity to make similar vocalizations, particularly in mating or territorial displays.\n\nThe study also suggests that the ability to make closed-mouth vocalizations, which are often lower in pitch and often associated with birds making cooing or mumbled sounds, might have been present in some dinosaurs. The researchers speculate that these vocalizations could have been used in mating displays, similar to the way birds use them today", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The team, led by Professor Jack Gallant, conducted experiments where subjects watched YouTube videos while their brain activity was monitored using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. The data collected was then used to create a computer model that could predict the visual input based on the brain's neural activity patterns. This could potentially lead to a future where the inner workings of our minds, including dreams, thoughts, and even the content of our imagination, could be decoded.\n\nThe researchers believe that this technology could be extended to decode not just static images, but also the complex, abstract visual experiences like dreams and thoughts. They envision a future where the technology could be used to broadcast the internal visual experiences, essentially translating the inner movie of the mind into a tangible form. However, the researchers acknowledge that the technology is still in its infancy and requires significant advancements in computing power to handle the vast amounts of data involved.\n\nThe potential applications of this technology are vast, ranging from enhancing user experience in virtual reality and augmented reality environments to aiding in the understanding of neurological disorders. It could also potentially aid in the field of medicine, particularly in diagnosing and treating neurological disorders.

Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.

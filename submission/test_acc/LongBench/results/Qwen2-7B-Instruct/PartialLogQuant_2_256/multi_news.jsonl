According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, the research team led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), revealed that cigarette smoke can alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to immune defenses. This stress on the bacteria leads to a change in its cell wall structure, which in turn makes the bacteria more resilient to the immune system's efforts to destroy it.\n\nThe study, which was a follow-up to previous research on e-cigarette vapor's effects on bacteria, found that the smoke exposure to MRSA resulted in a 40% increase in the bacteria's resistance to the immune system's defenses. This effect was observed in both lab studies and in mice models, indicating that the smoke's impact on the bacteria could lead to a higher risk of infection and potentially more severe outcomes.\n\nThe data also showed that the smoke-exposed MRSA bacteria were more likely to adhere to human cells, increasing the risk of infection.

The latest study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, involved analyzing the bloodstain patterns on the fabric to determine if they were consistent with each other and with the supposed crucifixion scenario depicted on the cloth.\n\nThe research team, led by forensic scientist Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University, used both human and synthetic blood samples to simulate the flow of blood on the Shroud. They found that the bloodstain patterns on the fabric did not align with the expected blood flow patterns for a person in a crucifixion position, particularly noting discrepancies in the angles of blood flow on the arms and the inconsistency of the bloodstain patterns across different body parts.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the bloodstain patterns on the Shroud are inconsistent with each other, suggesting that the fabric was likely created using a model positioned in various ways, rather than being a genuine burial cloth. This contradicts the theory that the Shroud is a genuine historical artifact from the time of Jesus. While the study does not conclusively prove the Shroud is a forgery, it raises doubts about the authenticity of the bloodstain patterns and their alignment with traditional crucifixion wounds.\n\nThe findings do not definitively rule out the possibility that the Shroud is a genuine religious relic, but they do suggest that further investigation is needed to understand how the bloodstain patterns were created.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The tax was repealed in neighboring areas, causing a shift in consumer behavior, with many opting to shop outside the city limits to avoid the tax.\n\nThe tax faced criticism from various quarters, including the American Heart Association, which argued that it was counterproductive, as it did not address the root causes of obesity and diabetes.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The reliquary, which is less than an inch long, was found in a 6th-century basilica on the Black Sea coast. The discovery is significant because it provides insight into the beliefs and practices of early Christians, who believed that the ashes contained healing properties. The reliquary is one of only 20 known examples of its kind, and it is the first to be found in Bulgaria. The discovery was made during excavations of a fortress site in Burgas, which also yielded a 10th-century seal belonging to a Bulgarian emperor. The site was previously denied to archaeologists due to the presence of a military base, but recent excavations have revealed a complex of buildings dating back to the Roman era. The discovery of the reliquary is seen as a significant find for the Burgas Regional Museum of History, which has been working to uncover the site's history for decades. The museum has also unearthed a 6th-century basilica and a 10th-century seal, which are both important archaeological artifacts in their own right. The discovery of the reliquary is expected to shed light on the beliefs systems and practices of early Christians and their pilgrimage traditions. The site, known as Burgas, was previously home to a Roman colony and later a key stronghold for the Bulgarian Empire.

The company's Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz, stated that the policy was designed to give employees the flexibility and support they need to balance work and family life, especially during the first year following the birth or adoption of a child. This move comes as a response to the changing demands of the workforce, particularly in terms of work-life balance, and Netflix hopes to attract and retain top talent by offering such benefits. The policy, which includes the option for employees to return to work part-time or full-time, followed by the possibility of returning and taking additional leave as needed, is expected to help employees focus on their work more effectively once they return from their parental leave. The policy also aims to eliminate the stress of traditional leave systems, such as state or disability pay, by providing a continuous income stream for employees. This initiative aligns with Netflix's overall strategy of fostering a supportive environment that encourages employees to thrive, both personally and professionally. While the policy is seen as a positive step, it also acknowledges the potential challenges of unlimited leave policies, such as the need for employees to plan their absences carefully to avoid disrupting their team or projects.

{"pred": "Colorectal cancer, often considered a disease primarily affecting older men, is increasingly being diagnosed in younger individuals, according to recent studies. Traditionally, screening recommendations suggested starting at age 50, but new data indicates that one in seven colorectal cancer patients is under 50, and this number is expected to rise significantly by 2030. The study, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendre and published in the journal Cancer, analyzed data from 1998 to 2011 for over 258,000 colorectal patients, revealing that younger patients are more likely to receive more aggressive treatments and have a slightly better prognosis despite being diagnosed with more advanced stages of cancer. \n\nThe analysis showed that younger patients were more likely to have localized or regional tumors spread, and they were more likely to undergo surgery and radiation therapy. Despite having more severe forms of the disease, younger patients had slightly better survival rates compared to older patients. This finding suggests that the medical community should consider adjusting screening guidelines to include younger individuals, potentially leading to earlier detection and better outcomes. However, the studies' limitations include the lack of information on family history and other risk factors, and it remains unclear whether changing screening age would ultimately improve survival rates.\n\nDr. Hendren, the lead researcher, emphasized the importance of recognizing symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel movements, and blood in the stool, which can indicate the need for a colon cancer screening. She also highlighted the need for further research to understand the reasons behind the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients, which might be related to environmental factors, lifestyle, and diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, another expert, suggested that while the increase in diagnosis is concerning, the rise in younger patients' colon cancer is not necessarily indicative of a higher mortality rate, as younger patients tend to have more aggressive treatments and better survival rates.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients necessitates a reevaluation of screening guidelines and the need for more awareness among healthcare professionals. The studies suggest that younger patients are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer, but they also have a better chance of survival due to more aggressive treatment methods. This calls for further investigation into the causes of the increase in younger patients' diagnosis and the potential need to adjust screening practices to include younger age groups.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "In recent astronomical research, a new perspective on galactic expansion and the potential for alien civilizations to harness energy from distant stars has emerged. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev initially conceptualized the three levels of technological advancement for civilizations, categorizing them as Type I, II, and III. Kardashev's original work laid the foundation for understanding the energy consumption and expansion of civilizations, but a recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermilab and a professor at the University of Chicago, adds a new dimension to this theory. Hooper suggests that the presence of dark energy, which causes the expansion of the universe, could lead to the creation of Dyson spheres - giant energy-harvesting structures around stars. These Dyson spheres would not only capture energy from the star but also potentially move the star itself towards the Dyson sphere's home planet, effectively harnessing the star's energy. This concept aligns with the idea that advanced civilizations might be using Dyson spheres to ensure their survival in the face of the expansion of the universe, which could eventually make it impossible for them to access the energy from their star. The paper also suggests that by monitoring the light from the star, astronomers could detect Dyson spheres and potentially identify alien civilizations. The paper's findings have yet to be peer-reviewed. \n\nIn a separate development, the Internet Archive has created a collection of outsider-uploaded Web archives, known as WARC files, which are not ingested into the Wayback Machine but are instead stored for public access. These WARC files contain data and content that has been uploaded by users and are accessible for reference and research purposes. \n\nLastly, in science fiction, Dyson spheres, or megastructures, have been a popular theme. These are theoretical constructs that would surround a star, harnessing its energy. In science fiction, Dyson spheres are often depicted as part of advanced civilizations' efforts to control and utilize the energy from their star. In \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" for example, a Dyson sphere is mentioned in the episode \"Relics.\" In \"Star Trek: The Original Series,\" the concept of Dyson spheres is referenced in the episode \"The Apple,\" where a Dyson sphere is mentioned as a possible explanation for the disappearance of a star. \n\nIn summary, the recent developments in astronomy include the potential for advanced civilizations to harness the energy from distant stars through Dyson spheres, and the Internet Archive's collection of outsider-uploaded WARC files, which are not ing", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was significantly influenced by environmental changes and the need to adapt to unpredictable food sources. This adaptation led to the development of innovative technologies and trading networks, which were crucial for survival. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools, dating back approximately 320,000 years, indicates that these advanced technologies emerged earlier than previously thought, challenging the notion that modern behaviors and cognitive abilities arose solely in Homo sapiens.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, a site rich in sedimentary layers, provided evidence of these early Middle Stone Age tools, alongside the first known use of red ochre pigment for decorative purposes. This finding suggests that the development of trade networks and social cooperation among early humans was essential for survival, particularly during periods of environmental instability.\n\nMoreover, the study highlights the importance of understanding the East African climate and its impact on the evolution of hominid species. The climate fluctuations, including droughts and earthquakes, forced early humans to expand their territories, engage in information sharing, and develop trading networks. This led to the emergence of Middle Stone Age technologies, which included the use of exotic materials like obsidian, indicating the development of specialized knowledge and social structures.\n\nThe discovery of Middle Stone Age tools, along with the use of red ochre pigment, suggests that early humans were capable of sophisticated cognitive and social activities, such as the sharing of resources and the creation of symbolic representations. This challenges previous assumptions that modern behaviors emerged exclusively with Homo sapiens, and suggests that these advancements occurred across multiple hominid species, including Homo sapiens, before the emergence of Homo sapiens. The findings emphasize the role of environmental factors in driving the evolution of early human societies, leading to the development of trading networks and the sharing of knowledge, which are foundational aspects of human evolution.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

The incident occurred in March 2014 when the panda, while wandering in the area, was chased by local officials attempting to capture it. The animal then proceeded to Guan's land, where it attacked him, resulting in injuries that required seven hours of surgery. Guan's son noted that the panda was covered in mud and that it bit him on the leg, releasing its grip only after another villager covered its head with a coat. The incident led to the creation of a lawsuit against the local forestry officials and the nearby Baishui Panda Nature Reserve. The case was settled through negotiations, with the officials agreeing to pay the compensation. The nature of the injuries sustained by Guan suggests that the leg might require amputation. This case highlights the potential dangers posed by wild pandas, which, despite their bamboo-chewing habits, are part of the bear family and possess the ability to cause significant harm. The incident also underscores the challenges faced in managing wildlife, particularly in areas where human and animal habitats overlap.

{"pred": "In a series of events intertwining music industry giants and environmental regulations, Gibson Guitar Corporation faced significant legal scrutiny and a series of raids conducted by federal marshals. These actions stemmed from Gibson's alleged involvement in trafficking illegally sourced wood, particularly from Madagascar, which houses valuable ebony and rosewood. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) had previously investigated Gibson's activities in the country, suggesting that the company knowingly engaged in a risky endeavor to source illegal timber.\n\nThe Gibson controversy escalated following a raid in 2009, leading to the confiscation of Gibson's shipments of illegally sourced ebony. The Lacey Act, enacted in 2008, prohibits the trade of illegally harvested plants and animals, including wood products. Gibson's management expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of clarity regarding the alleged violations and the legal status of their operations. The company claims that their purchases comply with both U.S. and Malayan laws, and they have ceased trading in illegal wood since 2009.\n\nIn response to the Gibson case, other industry professionals, such as Martin's Chris Martin, expressed support for the Lacey Act, emphasizing the importance of reducing illegal logging and the need for responsible sourcing practices. However, concerns arose among other guitar manufacturers who feared retroactive implications of the act, potentially affecting vintage instruments and requiring them to trace the origins of their wood.\n\nGeorge Gruhn, a prominent dealer of rare stringed instruments, acknowledged the challenges posed by the Lacey Act, stating that it has led to a shift in the industry towards greater caution and the elimination of certain types of international trade. The act's impact extends beyond Gibson, with other companies and individuals concerned about the potential for retroactive implications and the difficulty in proving the legality of their actions.\n\nThe Lacey Act's enforcement and its impact on the music industry highlight the growing tension between environmental protection and economic interests. The act aims to prevent the trade of illegally sourced timber, but its application and interpretation remain contentious issues. The Gibson case exemplifies the challenges faced by companies attempting to navigate the complexities of the act, especially when dealing with international sources of timber. The act's supporters argue that it promotes responsible sourcing and helps combat illegal logging, while critics contend that it imposes undue burdens on businesses and may lead to unintended consequences.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week. NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

{"pred": "In recent astronomical studies, scientists have uncovered that Mars once harbored a substantial ocean covering a significant portion of its northern region approximately 4 billion years ago. This ocean persisted for millions of years, eventually evaporating due to the planet's cooling atmosphere. The discovery of this ancient Martian ocean expands our understanding of Mars' potential to harbor life, as it suggests the planet was capable of maintaining a stable body of water for an extended period, which could have provided an environment conducive to the emergence of life.\n\nThe research team, led by Geronimo Villanueva from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, utilized data from the Keck II telescope, the Infrared Telescope Facility, and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. By analyzing the chemical composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, they determined that Mars once possessed a global ocean equivalent to 1,370 square kilometers, reaching depths of up to 1,000 feet. This ocean was believed to have existed in the northern lowlands of Mars, covering a significant area of the planet.\n\nHowever, the study also revealed that Mars has lost a significant amount of its original water content over time. The planet's thin atmosphere, combined with its weaker gravitational pull compared to Earth, allowed lighter hydrogen to escape into space, leaving behind a higher concentration of deuterium (heavy hydrogen) in the remaining water molecules. Scientists estimate that Mars originally contained a similar ratio of hydrogen isotopes as Earth, but over billions of years, the lighter hydrogen evaporated into space, leaving Mars with a higher proportion of deuterium in its water molecules.\n\nThis loss of hydrogen resulted in Mars having less water available for geological processes, such as the formation of lakes and rivers, compared to Earth. However, the planet still managed to retain a significant amount of water in the form of ice caps in the polar regions. The discovery of this ancient Martian ocean strengthens the possibility that Mars could have been a more hospitable environment for life, as liquid water is essential for biological processes.\n\nThe findings contribute to ongoing discussions regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life on Mars, especially considering the planet's past conditions. The presence of an ancient ocean suggests that Mars might have offered a more stable environment for life to develop compared to its current state, characterized by frozen water in the polar caps. While the exact nature of any Martian life remains speculative, the study highlights the importance of further exploration to uncover clues about the planet's past environments and potential for supporting life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The ECJ overturned a previous decision that Nestlé's trademark appeal for the four-finger-shaped bar was unjustified, stating that the trademark should not have been granted in the first place. This ruling could pave the way for other manufacturers to produce similar-looking products without infringing Nestlé's trademark rights.\n\nThe saga began in 2000 when Nestlé launched its legal challenge against the trademark registration of the Kit Kat bar's shape. The battle escalated further in 2007 when the European Union's trademark authority approved Nestlé's appeal, sparking a series of appeals and counter-appeals. The ECJ's latest ruling dismisses Nestlé's appeal against the 2016 decision that the trademark authority incorrectly rejected the company's claim that the distinctive shape of the Kit Kat bar warranted trademark protection.\n\nMondelez, the owner of the popular four-fingered chocolate bar, Cadbury, had previously contested Nestlé's trademark claim. However, the ECJ's ruling suggests that the trademark should not have been granted in the first instance, leaving the door open for other manufacturers to produce similar products without fear of legal repercussions. The ruling could potentially dismantle barriers to entry for competitors seeking to replicate the distinctive shape of the Kit Kat bar.\n\nThe decision raises questions about the process of trademark registration and the criteria for proving distinctive characteristics across multiple jurisdictions within the European Union. It also highlights the complexities of navigating trademark disputes on a country-by-country basis, particularly when considering the unique regulations and historical context of each market.

{"pred": "Cigarette smoke, known for its harmful effects on human health, has recently been found to impact the virulence of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, the research team led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), revealed that cigarette smoke can alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to immune defenses. This stress on the bacteria leads to a change in its cell wall structure, which in turn makes the bacteria more resilient to the immune system's efforts to destroy it.\n\nThe study, which was a follow-up to previous research on e-cigarette vapor's effects on bacteria, found that the smoke exposure to MRSA resulted in a 40% increase in the bacteria's resistance to the immune system's defenses. This effect was observed in both lab studies and in mice models, indicating that the smoke's impact on the bacteria could lead to a higher risk of infection and potentially more severe outcomes.\n\nThe data also showed that the smoke-exposed MRSA bacteria were more likely to adhere to human cells, increasing the risk of infection. The study further revealed that the smoke-induced changes in the bacteria's cell wall could lead to a longer-lasting resistance to antibiotics, potentially increasing the bacteria's survival time within the body.\n\nDr. Crotty Alexander and her team believe that their findings could provide a new perspective on the role of smoking in the development of antibiotic-resistant infections. They hope that their research will contribute to the growing understanding of the complex interplay between smoking, the human immune system, and the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

About 200 kids have been diagnosed since 2014, and this year's figures are especially troubling. The CDC reports 121 cases of AFM were confirmed in 2014, but that was followed by just 21 cases in 2015, reports Fox News. From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully. A CDC study found 68% of patients had a fever and 81% had a respiratory illness before AFM symptoms appeared. Some had been diagnosed with the West Nile virus, and others with an enterovirus. \"August to October is typically when enteroviruses circulate\" and \"we see more acute flaccid myelitis during that season,\" a doctor tells NBC News. Washing your hands and covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing are among the ways suggested to help. (Four siblings suffer from a mysterious disease.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4776}
{"pred": "In a new forensic investigation, researchers have suggested that the Shroud of Turin, a religious artifact believed to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, may be a fraudulent medieval creation. The Shroud, which bears the image of a crucified man, has been the subject of extensive analysis and scrutiny, with some experts dating it to between 1260 and 1390 AD. The latest study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, involved analyzing the bloodstain patterns on the fabric to determine if they were consistent with each other and with the supposed crucifixion scenario depicted on the cloth.\n\nThe research team, led by forensic scientist Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University, used both human and synthetic blood samples to simulate the flow of blood on the Shroud. They found that the bloodstain patterns on the fabric did not align with the expected blood flow patterns for a person in a crucifixion position, particularly noting discrepancies in the angles of blood flow on the arms and the inconsistency of the bloodstain patterns across different body parts.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the bloodstain patterns on the Shroud are inconsistent with each other, suggesting that the fabric was likely created using a model positioned in various ways, rather than being a genuine burial cloth. This contradicts the theory that the Shroud is a genuine historical artifact from the time of Jesus. While the study does not conclusively prove the Shroud is a forgery, it raises doubts about the authenticity of the bloodstain patterns and their alignment with traditional crucifixion wounds.\n\nThe findings do not definitively rule out the possibility that the Shroud is a genuine religious relic, but they do suggest that further investigation is needed to understand how the bloodstain patterns were created. The results of this study add to the ongoing debate about the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, which continues to intrigue believers and scholars alike.", "answers": ["The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion; bloodstains on the linen shroud, which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb, form the image of a crucified man. But a new study reported in the Journal of Forensic Sciences finds the bloodstain image was likely faked. Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports. As the researchers put it, the stains are \"totally unrealistic\" when compared to what they should look like. The shroud, which is held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Italy, is considered an icon, as opposed to a genuine religious relic, by the Vatican; Fox News notes \"the church has never weighed in on its authenticity.\" \"This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,\" the forensic scientist who conducted the analysis tells BuzzFeed News. \"Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.\" The study found inconsistent staining, with researchers concluding multiple poses were used to create the bloodstains—a standing model was likely used to imprint patterns on the cloth at various angles for various body parts. Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

For instance, in Moldova, there has been a 70% reduction in institutionalized children since 2007, and in the Czech Republic, there has been a 75% decrease in admissions to institutions. In Bulgaria, the number of institutionalized children has dropped by 54%, and the number of foster carers has increased by 440%.\n\nLumos believes that the global issue of institutionalizing children is a moral imperative and a significant economic opportunity. By investing in family-based care, the organization aims to reduce the number of children in institutions and improve their overall well-being. The organization's model has proven successful in various countries, including Moldova, where there has been a 70% reduction in institutionalized children, and the Czech Republic, where the number of institutionalized children has decreased by 16% in the past year.\n\nThe organization also emphasizes the importance of international awareness and support for this issue. The success of Lumos in countries like Moldova, the Czech Republic, and others demonstrates that with the right policies and investments, it is possible to significantly reduce the number of children in institutions. The organization hopes to continue its efforts to raise awareness and change the narrative around institutionalizing children, aiming to make it a moral imperative for all nations to prioritize family-based care over institutionalization.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution.

To address this issue, some lenders offer \"no credit check\" options, allowing individuals to apply for loans without the hassle of a traditional credit check. However, it's crucial to remember that these loans come with a price tag, and the interest rate can be high, particularly if the loan isn't settled within the agreed-upon timeframe.\n\nThe availability of these loans is subject to certain criteria, including being a permanent resident of the UK, being at least 18 years old, having a stable income, and possessing a bank account. Additionally, the loan amount should not exceed £1,500, making them suitable for smaller financial needs. These loans can be repaid through manageable monthly installments, providing a sense of relief for those in need of immediate funds.\n\nTo apply for these loans, one can use an online platform, filling out a simple application form. This process is streamlined, taking only a few minutes, and the application can be submitted directly to the lender. The articles suggest that these loans are a valuable resource for those who might otherwise struggle to secure financial assistance due to their credit history. However, it's essential to carefully consider the terms and conditions before applying, as the interest rates can be quite high, especially if the loan isn't repaid within the agreed-upon period.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones?

Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The tax was expected to raise $15 million annually. However, the tax had unintended consequences, including a 64% increase in the price of a case of soda, leading to a 38% decline in sales at Seattle's Costco stores. The tax was repealed in neighboring areas, causing a shift in consumer behavior, with many opting to shop outside the city limits to avoid the tax.\n\nThe tax faced criticism from various quarters, including the American Heart Association, which argued that it was counterproductive, as it did not address the root causes of obesity and diabetes. Instead, it targeted the most vulnerable populations, such as low-income individuals and those reliant on food stamps. The tax was also criticized for not applying to sugar-sweetened beverages, leaving a loophole for companies to circumvent the tax.\n\nThe repeal of the tax in Cook County, Illinois, within months of its implementation, demonstrated the negative impact on the economy and health outcomes. The tax led to a decline in sales of sugary drinks, with many consumers choosing to shop outside the county to avoid the tax. This resulted in a loss of revenue for the county and a decrease in the consumption of unhealthy beverages, contradicting the initial goal of improving health outcomes.\n\nSeattle's tax faced similar criticism, with some arguing that it was regressive and disproportionately affecting lower-income households.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The House is considering a bill that would delay the health law for a year, which could face opposition from the Senate Democrats. The Senate, led by Democratic Senator Harry Reid, is taking a hardline stance against the Affordable Care Act, aiming to avoid compromising on the health law or the medical device tax repeal. Reid believes that the political backlash from a shutdown will be detrimental to the Republican Party, potentially leading to a loss of seats in the Senate.

The Senate is expected to convene on Monday to vote on the bill, with the House likely to follow suit.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Acxiom, for instance, sells detailed personal data, including information on individuals' health conditions, consumption habits, and even specific brand preferences. Experian, on the other hand, sold personal data to a criminal identity theft ring, and Datalogix provided extensive consumer data to marketers.\n\nAcxiom, in particular, was found to have compiled a vast database of over 75,000 data points, including personal details like beverage consumption patterns, travel frequency, and even specific health conditions.

The existence of this planet, named \"Planet Nine,\" has been proposed based on the observed anomalies in the orbits of several small, icy objects in the outer solar system. The researchers, Caltech astronomers Mike Brown and Caltech postdoctoral scholar Konstantin Batygin, have not observed the planet directly, but their models predict it exerts a significant gravitational influence on the orbits of these smaller bodies.\n\nMike Brown, known as the \"Pluto Killer\" due to his role in the reclassification of Pluto as a \"dwarf planet\" in 2006, has been actively seeking a new planet since then. He has not only found evidence of Planet Nine but also plans to publish a book titled \"How I Killed Pluto and Why It's a Good Thing.\"\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure our understanding of the solar system's composition, potentially leading to a reevaluation of the current planetary classification system. The existence of this planet would also impact the status of Pluto, which was previously considered the ninth planet until it was reclassified as a \"dwarf planet\" in 2006. The new evidence for Planet Nine could lead to a reevaluation of Pluto's status, with some scientists advocating for its reinstatement as a full-fledged planet.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine continues, with astronomers teams across the globe eagerly awaiting the confirmation of its existence. The discovery of this planet would not only expand our knowledge of the solar system but also challenge existing definitions and classifications of celestial bodies. The search for Planet Nine is expected to involve a combination of observational astronomy and theoretical predictions, with the possibility of direct detection within the next few years. The confirmation of Planet Nine's existence would likely result in a reevaluation of the current planetary classification system, potentially leading to a reclassification of Pluto and the introduction of a new category for this newly discovered planet.\n\nIn summary, the existence of Planet Nine, if confirmed, would significantly alter our understanding of the solar system's structure and the classification of celestial bodies within it.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet.

As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.)

{"pred": "Colorectal cancer, often considered a disease primarily affecting older men, is increasingly being diagnosed in younger individuals, according to recent studies. Traditionally, screening recommendations suggested starting at age 50, but new data indicates that one in seven colorectal cancer patients is under 50, and this number is expected to rise significantly by 2030. The study, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendre and published in the journal Cancer, analyzed data from 1998 to 2011 for over 258,000 colorectal patients, revealing that younger patients are more likely to receive more aggressive treatments and have a slightly better prognosis despite being diagnosed with more advanced stages of cancer. \n\nThe analysis showed that younger patients were more likely to have localized or regional tumors spread, and they were more likely to undergo surgery and radiation therapy. Despite having more severe forms of the disease, younger patients had slightly better survival rates compared to older patients. This finding suggests that the medical community should consider adjusting screening guidelines to include younger individuals, potentially leading to earlier detection and better outcomes. However, the studies' limitations include the lack of information on family history and other risk factors, and it remains unclear whether changing screening age would ultimately improve survival rates.\n\nDr. Hendren, the lead researcher, emphasized the importance of recognizing symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel movements, and blood in the stool, which can indicate the need for a colon cancer screening. She also highlighted the need for further research to understand the reasons behind the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients, which might be related to environmental factors, lifestyle, and diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, another expert, suggested that while the increase in diagnosis is concerning, the rise in younger patients' colon cancer is not necessarily indicative of a higher mortality rate, as younger patients tend to have more aggressive treatments and better survival rates.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients necessitates a reevaluation of screening guidelines and the need for more awareness among healthcare professionals. The studies suggest that younger patients are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer, but they also have a better chance of survival due to more aggressive treatment methods. This calls for further investigation into the causes of the increase in younger patients' diagnosis and the potential need to adjust screening practices to include younger age groups.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

{"pred": "In recent astronomical research, a new perspective on galactic expansion and the potential for alien civilizations to harness energy from distant stars has emerged. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev initially conceptualized the three levels of technological advancement for civilizations, categorizing them as Type I, II, and III. Kardashev's original work laid the foundation for understanding the energy consumption and expansion of civilizations, but a recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermilab and a professor at the University of Chicago, adds a new dimension to this theory. Hooper suggests that the presence of dark energy, which causes the expansion of the universe, could lead to the creation of Dyson spheres - giant energy-harvesting structures around stars. These Dyson spheres would not only capture energy from the star but also potentially move the star itself towards the Dyson sphere's home planet, effectively harnessing the star's energy. This concept aligns with the idea that advanced civilizations might be using Dyson spheres to ensure their survival in the face of the expansion of the universe, which could eventually make it impossible for them to access the energy from their star. The paper also suggests that by monitoring the light from the star, astronomers could detect Dyson spheres and potentially identify alien civilizations. The paper's findings have yet to be peer-reviewed. \n\nIn a separate development, the Internet Archive has created a collection of outsider-uploaded Web archives, known as WARC files, which are not ingested into the Wayback Machine but are instead stored for public access. These WARC files contain data and content that has been uploaded by users and are accessible for reference and research purposes. \n\nLastly, in science fiction, Dyson spheres, or megastructures, have been a popular theme.

In \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" for example, a Dyson sphere is mentioned in the episode \"Relics.\" In \"Star Trek: The Original Series,\" the concept of Dyson spheres is referenced in the episode \"The Apple,\" where a Dyson sphere is mentioned as a possible explanation for the disappearance of a star. \n\nIn summary, the recent developments in astronomy include the potential for advanced civilizations to harness the energy from distant stars through Dyson spheres, and the Internet Archive's collection of outsider-uploaded WARC files, which are not ing", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was significantly influenced by environmental changes and the need to adapt to unpredictable food sources. This adaptation led to the development of innovative technologies and trading networks, which were crucial for survival. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools, dating back approximately 320,000 years, indicates that these advanced technologies emerged earlier than previously thought, challenging the notion that modern behaviors and cognitive abilities arose solely in Homo sapiens.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, a site rich in sedimentary layers, provided evidence of these early Middle Stone Age tools, alongside the first known use of red ochre pigment for decorative purposes. This finding suggests that the development of trade networks and social cooperation among early humans was essential for survival, particularly during periods of environmental instability.\n\nMoreover, the study highlights the importance of understanding the East African climate and its impact on the evolution of hominid species. The climate fluctuations, including droughts and earthquakes, forced early humans to expand their territories, engage in information sharing, and develop trading networks. This led to the emergence of Middle Stone Age technologies, which included the use of exotic materials like obsidian, indicating the development of specialized knowledge and social structures.\n\nThe discovery of Middle Stone Age tools, along with the use of red ochre pigment, suggests that early humans were capable of sophisticated cognitive and social activities, such as the sharing of resources and the creation of symbolic representations. This challenges previous assumptions that modern behaviors emerged exclusively with Homo sapiens, and suggests that these advancements occurred across multiple hominid species, including Homo sapiens, before the emergence of Homo sapiens. The findings emphasize the role of environmental factors in driving the evolution of early human societies, leading to the development of trading networks and the sharing of knowledge, which are foundational aspects of human evolution.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

These actions stemmed from Gibson's alleged involvement in trafficking illegally sourced wood, particularly from Madagascar, which houses valuable ebony and rosewood. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) had previously investigated Gibson's activities in the country, suggesting that the company knowingly engaged in a risky endeavor to source illegal timber.\n\nThe Gibson controversy escalated following a raid in 2009, leading to the confiscation of Gibson's shipments of illegally sourced ebony. The Lacey Act, enacted in 2008, prohibits the trade of illegally harvested plants and animals, including wood products. Gibson's management expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of clarity regarding the alleged violations and the legal status of their operations. The company claims that their purchases comply with both U.S. and Malayan laws, and they have ceased trading in illegal wood since 2009.\n\nIn response to the Gibson case, other industry professionals, such as Martin's Chris Martin, expressed support for the Lacey Act, emphasizing the importance of reducing illegal logging and the need for responsible sourcing practices. However, concerns arose among other guitar manufacturers who feared retroactive implications of the act, potentially affecting vintage instruments and requiring them to trace the origins of their wood.\n\nGeorge Gruhn, a prominent dealer of rare stringed instruments, acknowledged the challenges posed by the Lacey Act, stating that it has led to a shift in the industry towards greater caution and the elimination of certain types of international trade.

The Gibson case exemplifies the challenges faced by companies attempting to navigate the complexities of the act, especially when dealing with international sources of timber.

{"pred": "In recent astronomical studies, scientists have uncovered that Mars once harbored a substantial ocean covering a significant portion of its northern region approximately 4 billion years ago. This ocean persisted for millions of years, eventually evaporating due to the planet's cooling atmosphere. The discovery of this ancient Martian ocean expands our understanding of Mars' potential to harbor life, as it suggests the planet was capable of maintaining a stable body of water for an extended period, which could have provided an environment conducive to the emergence of life.\n\nThe research team, led by Geronimo Villanueva from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, utilized data from the Keck II telescope, the Infrared Telescope Facility, and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. By analyzing the chemical composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, they determined that Mars once possessed a global ocean equivalent to 1,370 square kilometers, reaching depths of up to 1,000 feet. This ocean was believed to have existed in the northern lowlands of Mars, covering a significant area of the planet.\n\nHowever, the study also revealed that Mars has lost a significant amount of its original water content over time. The planet's thin atmosphere, combined with its weaker gravitational pull compared to Earth, allowed lighter hydrogen to escape into space, leaving behind a higher concentration of deuterium (heavy hydrogen) in the remaining water molecules. Scientists estimate that Mars originally contained a similar ratio of hydrogen isotopes as Earth, but over billions of years, the lighter hydrogen evaporated into space, leaving Mars with a higher proportion of deuterium in its water molecules.\n\nThis loss of hydrogen resulted in Mars having less water available for geological processes, such as the formation of lakes and rivers, compared to Earth. However, the planet still managed to retain a significant amount of water in the form of ice caps in the polar regions. The discovery of this ancient Martian ocean strengthens the possibility that Mars could have been a more hospitable environment for life, as liquid water is essential for biological processes.\n\nThe findings contribute to ongoing discussions regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life on Mars, especially considering the planet's past conditions. The presence of an ancient ocean suggests that Mars might have offered a more stable environment for life to develop compared to its current state, characterized by frozen water in the polar caps. While the exact nature of any Martian life remains speculative, the study highlights the importance of further exploration to uncover clues about the planet's past environments and potential for supporting life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

By analyzing brain imaging data from subjects watching videos, they developed a model that could predict the content of the video based on subtle changes in blood flow to the visual cortex. This breakthrough could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of internal mental processes, including dreams, thoughts, and memories. However, the researchers caution that the technology is still in its infancy and requires further development, particularly in terms of computational power needed to process the vast amounts of data involved.\n\nThe team, led by Professor Jack Gallant, has already demonstrated the ability to reconstruct the visual experience of subjects by analyzing their brain activity patterns. The reconstructed videos, while blurry and abstract, provide a glimpse into the subjects' inner visual experiences. This technology could pave the way for advancements in fields such as virtual reality, where it could enable users to experience scenes as if they were real, or in medical applications, where it could aid in diagnosing and treating neurological disorders.\n\nWhile the potential for using this technology in criminal investigations or court cases is intriguing, it remains speculative. The researchers emphasize the importance of understanding the limitations of the technology, especially when applied to abstract concepts like dreams and thoughts.

The sequester, which is set to take effect on March 1st, has been described as a potential disaster by some, including former President Barack Obama, who called for a halt to the sequester during a press conference. However, the actual impact of the sequester on the average American seems minimal, as evidenced by the fact that Congress has been largely inactive, with only a few sessions held without any substantive action being taken. The sequester is seen as a tool for politicians to use as a means of scaring the public into believing that the country is facing a dire situation, similar to the fear tactics used during the \"fiscal cliff\" debate. Despite the severity of the potential cuts, such as those to NASA, the sequester does not affect the salaries of senators and representatives, who continue to receive their full paychecks. This discrepancy between the impact of the cuts on the general public and the continued financial benefits for politicians has led to a lack of urgency in addressing the sequester, with many lawmakers opting to take extended breaks instead of working on solutions.

Police, who have described the deaths as \"suspicious,\" revealed Sunday that the cause of death for both Shermans was \"ligature neck compression,\" a form of strangulation, the CBC reports. Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later.

{"pred": "In Egypt, the final round of parliamentary elections coincided with the ongoing trial of former President Hosni Mubarak. Islamist groups, particularly the Freedom and Justice Party, consolidated their influence in the first two rounds of elections, leading analysts to predict that they might dominate the third phase. The vote in the North and South Sinai governorates, including the Delta region, saw a surge in support for the Freedom and Justice Party, which is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. However, the outcome of the election remains uncertain, as the exact formula for allocating seats among parties based on their share of the vote is yet to be clarified. The final tally of seats will determine the power dynamics between the newly elected parliament, which will convene on January 23rd, and the military rulers who have vowed to retain significant control over the interim government. \n\nThe trial of Mubarak resumed amidst heightened anticipation, with the first day focusing on the prosecution's case against the former president. The prosecutor, Mustafa Suleiman, portrayed Mubarak as a tyrant responsible for violence and oppression, highlighting his role in orchestrting the 2011 parliamentary elections to secure his son's succession. The prosecution emphasized the corruption and power struggle within the Mubarak regime, suggesting that the former president aimed to perpetuate his power through his son's political advancement. The trial's next steps include further examination of the evidence against Mubarak and his co-defendants, including his sons, Alaa and Gamal, and his aide, who is currently in hiding. The trial proceedings underscored the ongoing scrutiny of the ousted president's actions during the uprising and the subsequent governance transition. The trial's conclusion is anticipated to shed light on the extent of Mubarak's culpability in the violence and the broader implications for Egypt's political landscape.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "On Wednesday evening in Mendon, a Toyota Corolla, driven by Nabila Altahan, became suspended from a telephone guy wire after reacting too swiftly to a GPS unit's instruction to turn around. The incident occurred around 8 p.m., as Altahan was westbound on Route 4, passing her intended destination. The car left the lane of traffic due to the sudden direction change from the GPS, causing it to end up suspended on the telephone wire. Fortunately, neither Altahan nor her passenger, who managed to jump out of the vehicle, were injured during the event. The accident was witnessed by a mini-golf course employee, and both state police and the Rutland City Fire Department were called to the scene. This event highlights the potential dangers of relying solely on GPS devices for navigation, especially in situations where quick reactions are required.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP.

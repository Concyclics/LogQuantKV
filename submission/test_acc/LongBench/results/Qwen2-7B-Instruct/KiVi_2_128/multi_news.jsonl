The study, conducted by a team at the University of Tolouse, used a modified version of Google's PageRank algorithm to analyze Wikipedia articles across 24 different language editions. The researchers found that the most influential person in the world, based on this modified ranking, was Carl Linneus, a 18th-century Swedish biologist known for his contributions to taxonomy. However, the study also revealed that Linneus' influence stemmed largely from the fact that many scientific terms and concepts are named after him, leading to a high number of incoming links to his Wikipedia page. The study's methodology and findings suggest that Linneaus' influence is not only due to his contributions to science, but also the sheer volume of links pointing to his Wikipedia page. The study's lead author, Young-Ho Eom, notes that Linneaus' influence is not necessarily indicative of his actual impact on society, but rather reflects the structure of Wikipedia's internal linking system. The study's findings suggest that Linneaus' influence is disproportionately represented in the Wikipedia data, leading to his ranking as the most influential person.", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The reliquary, which is only 2.2 cm long, was found in a 6th-century basilica in Burgas, Bulgaria. The discovery was made during excavations of the ancient and medieval Burgas fortress. The reliquary, which is one of the most significant finds in the history of the Burgas Museum, is believed to have been brought back in the 6th century by a pilgrim from the Foros peninsula (now part of modern-day Turkey) to the basilica in Ephesus, where the tomb of John the Apostle was located. The reliquary contained ashes from the grave of John the Apostle, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ, and was likely brought back by a pilgrim from Ephesus. The discovery of the reliquary is significant because it provides insight into the religious practices and beliefs of early Christians, who believed that the ashes contained within the reliquary had healing properties. The reliquary is one of only 4 known worldwide, and the only one in Bulgaria, making it a rare and valuable find.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

{"pred": "Col Initialise the colon cancer screening at age 50, the age at which doctors recommend starting regular screenings, is being reconsidered due to a growing number of younger people being diagnosed with the disease. A study found that one in seven colon and rectal cancers are diagnosed in individuals under 50, with these patients often presenting with more advanced stages of the disease. This is attributed to the fact that these patients are diagnosed later in their lives, often only after symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel movements, or pain have appeared. The study, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendren, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Michigan, and published in the analysis, concluded that younger patients are more likely to have advanced-stage cancer when diagnosed, and are more likely to receive aggressive treatment. However, it's unclear whether screening guidelines should be changed to accommodate this trend. The study also found that younger patients are more likely to have their cancer detected at an advanced stage, and that they are more likely to have surgery and radiation therapy. The study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, said that the findings suggest that younger patients' treatment and survival rates are better, even though they are diagnosed with more advanced cancer.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

It's \"daring, sophisticated and unforgettably disturbing.\" And \"in scale, scope and the space it offers for a long-awaited moral reckoning, it's nothing less than monumental.\" \"It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is,\" writes Lindsey Bahr at the AP, calling Detroit \"a well-made and evocative film\" jam-packed with \"stomach-churning horror.\" She argues there could be more nuance and perspective. But \"maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with Detroit is the point.\" Chris Klimek says Detroit is \"maddeningly imperfect but still honorable,\" citing \"lightly fictionalized\" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up \"for maximum outrage.\" This is \"messy work, even when it’s done in good faith,\" he writes at NPR.

Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them.\" Head writer Ben Karlin: \"I remember seeing it in the editing room. I remember Jon called me down, and seeing it and thinking, Yeah, this is what we should be doing. This is the goal. It was one of Carell’s most incredible moments. He asks McCain a question in a way that no journalists were talking to the candidates. And it was like, Oh s---, we are able, in this weird, unintentional way, to add a level of insight to the process that doesn’t exist. That was really, really exciting.\" Click for the full piece, in which Stewart talks about how that 2000 campaign provided his \"aha moment\" of how to present the show—by \"deconstructing the process.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 7229}

{"pred": "Recent studies have revealed that the evolution of human behavior and technological advancements occurred much earlier than previously thought, challenging the notion that modern human characteristics emerged solely with Homo sapiens. Three new papers in the journal Science have uncovered dramatic shifts in the East African climate that may have driven the development of advanced cognitive and trading abilities among early humans. The research indicates that around 300,000 years ago, the environment in the region became increasingly unpredictable due to climate change, leading to the need for information sharing, resource gathering, and innovation. This resulted in the emergence of Middle Stone Age tools, which began around 320,000 years ago. These tools were smaller, more specialized, and likely indicative of a shift in the Olorgesaili Basin in Kenya, where the researchers found that the Middle Stone Age tools are the oldest of their kind, dating back to 320,000 years ago. The researchers propose that the development of these tools and the use of exotic materials like obsidian suggests a shift in the Olorgesailie region's climate, which may have prompted the development of trading networks and the emergence of Homo sapiens or their close relatives. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools and the use of red and black pigments suggests that the Homo sapiens or their predecessors had advanced cognitive abilities, including the ability to share knowledge and resources, and the potential for innovation and information sharing.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The new boarding protocol involves designating passengers into two boarding lanes, with passengers boarding in groups numbered sequentially. The first boarding group, comprising of passengers holding Priority 1K and 1G flyers, will proceed through the first boarding lane, followed by Group 2, which comprises passengers holding Priority 2G memberships. The third boarding group consists of passengers in Group 3, then 4, 5, and 6. The airline anticipates that this revised boarding system will alleviate passenger congestion and improve the boarding experience.\n\nIn tandem, the airline industry heavyweight, American Airlines, has also undergone a boarding reform, eliminating the traditional boarding queues and replacing them with digital signage notifying passengers electronically when it is their designated boarding time. This aims to streamline the process and minimize confusion and delays typically encountered during the boarding phase. The airline anticipates that this will lead to a smoother, more efficient boarding process, benefiting both passengers and the airline's operational efficiency. \n\nMeanwhile, the airline unveiled a new boarding process aimed at reducing congestion and improving the customer experience. The new boarding lanes will be numbered 1 and 2, representing lanes colored differently. The first boarding lane signifies passengers in Group 1, primarily for passengers holding Priority 1K and 2G memberships, and those who qualify for early boarding. The second boarding group, represented by Group 2, includes passengers eligible for Group 1 membership, first-class flyers, and members of the airline's loyalty program. The airline anticipates that this new boarding system will significantly reduce congestion and improve the boarding experience for passengers.\n\nAdditionally, the airline has partnered with Copa Airlines and Avianca Airlines to initiate a joint business alliance, aiming to consolidate their flight routes and introduce new routes, flights, and competitive offerings. This strategic collaboration seeks to enhance passenger convenience, expand connectivity, and reduce ticket prices amidst fierce competition. The airline emphasizes that the revised boarding system facilitates a more orderly and efficient boarding process, benefiting both the airline and its passengers.\n\nIn conjunction with this, the airline has also implemented a digital notification system, sending boarding notifications directly to passengers' mobile devices, informing them of their boarding time.

Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up.

But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated.

The study, which analyzed the evolution of vocalization in birds, found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are often heard in birds, originated at least 16 times in the evolutionary history of birds and crocodiles. These vocalizations are often associated with mating displays, and the researchers suggest that dinosaurs, being part of the same group as birds and crocodiles, may have also made similar vocalizations. The researchers believe that dinosaurs, if they had vocal cords, may have made sounds similar to the muffled, low-frequency cooing and hooting that some birds exhibit today. The researchers suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization, which is not well understood, might have been present in dinosaurs, allowing them to make sounds akin to those of birds and crocodiles. The study also suggests that the ability to make closed-mouth vocalizations arose multiple times in the evolutionary history of birds and reptiles, indicating that dinosaurs might have been capable of making similar sounds, though no direct evidence of dinosaur vocalization currently exists. The study suggests that dinosaurs might have had the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization, which could explain the presence of some dinosaur-like sounds in movies and literature.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

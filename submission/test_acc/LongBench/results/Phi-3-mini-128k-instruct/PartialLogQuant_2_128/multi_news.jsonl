The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

Radiocarbon dating places the shroud's origin between 1260 and 1390 CE, but its bloodstain patterns have raised questions about its authenticity.\n\nA recent forensic investigation led by Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist, and Luigi Garlaschelli, a chemist, has shed new light on the bloodstain patterns on the Shroud of Turin. Their study, which involved the use of real and synthetic blood samples, aimed to understand the formation of the bloodstains on the shroud.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different tests on the bloodstains, focusing on the hands, forearms, chest, and waist of the figure depicted on the shroud.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks. But for the Washington area, this is a tsunami.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 3547}

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

Traditionally, CRC has been associated with older age groups, with screening recommended to begin at 50. However, new research indicates that nearly 15% of CRC patients are diagnosed before reaching this age, with a higher likelihood of advanced disease and aggressive treatment.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team, analyzed data from over 250,000 colorectal cancer patients in the United States between 1998 and 2011. The findings revealed that one in seven colorectal cancer patients is diagnosed under the age of 50. Younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, with a higher chance of metastasis to lymph nodes or other organs. Despite the more aggressive nature of their disease, these younger patients lived slightly longer without cancer recurrence, likely due to more aggressive treatment approaches.\n\nThe researchers emphasize the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger patients, as well as the potential for changing screening guidelines to begin at a younger age. However, the authors also caution that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults are not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to determine the best course of action.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of early detection and the need for healthcare providers to be vigilant in identifying symptoms of colorectal cancer in younger patients. These symptoms may include anemia, blood in the stool, or bowel changes, which should prompt further investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, the findings of this study serve as a wake-up call to the medical community, urging them to reconsider the current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening and to prepare for the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

{"pred": "In a groundbreaking study, scientists have proposed a three-step process for advanced civilizations to harness energy from their universe, a concept that could lead to the discovery of extraterrestrial life. The process, known as the Kardashev Scale, was first introduced by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1964. It categorizes civilizations into three types based on their ability to utilize energy: Type I civilizations use all available resources on their home planet, Type II civilizations harness the energy of their star, and Type III civilizations utilize the energy of an entire galaxy.\n\nRecently, a paper by Hooper and Dyson spheres have been proposed as a way for civilizations to harness the energy of their stars. A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that completely encompasses a star to capture its energy output. The concept of Dyson spheres has been a popular theme in science fiction, with notable mentions in the works of Arthur C. Clarke and Larry Niven.\n\nThe recent paper by Hooper and others has revived the concept of Dyson spheres and their potential role in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The paper suggests that advanced civilizations may harness the energy of their stars by constructing a swarm of satellites, known as a Dyson swarm, which would orbit a star and collect its energy.\n\nThe study also explores the possibility of detecting advanced civilizations by observing the energy signatures they may leave behind. For example, an advanced civilization that has harnessed the energy of their star may exhibit unusual light signatures in the form of a galaxy's light spectrum.\n\nThe search for extraterrestrial civilizations has also been expanded to include the detection of \"dark energy\" signatures, which could indicate the presence of a civilization that has harnessed the energy of their star.\n\nThe study concludes that the search for extraterrestrial civilizations may be aided by the detection of unusual light signatures in the form of a galaxy's light spectrum, which could indicate the presence of a civilization that has harnessed the energy of their star.\n\nIn summary, the search for extraterrestrial civilizations may be aided by the detection of unusual light signatures in the form", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

{"pred": "Mars, Once a Warm, Wet World - NASA's Kepler Telescope Finds Evidence of an Ancient Ocean\n\nIn a groundbreaking study, NASA scientists have unveiled evidence that ancient Mars was once a warm and wet world, with a vast ocean that could have been hospitable to life. Using data from the Kepler Space Telescope, researchers have found that Mars was once home to a global ocean covering about 137 meters deep, equivalent to a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe study, led by Geronimo Villanueva of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, analyzed the Martian atmosphere's water vapor composition. The researchers discovered that the Martian water vapor contained a higher concentration of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, compared to Earth's water. This suggests that Mars lost a significant amount of its water over time, leaving behind a higher concentration of deuterium.\n\nThe researchers calculated that the ancient ocean would have covered about 1,000 miles of the Martian surface, equivalent to a fifth of the planet's surface area. This ocean, which would have been at least 137 meters deep, could have been a global ocean covering a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe findings suggest that Mars was once a much wetter and warmer world, with a global ocean that could have been up to a mile deep. The researchers believe that the ocean may have been present for at least 1.5 billion years, long enough for life to have evolved.\n\nThe study's results are significant, as they suggest that Mars was once a much more habitable planet than it is today. The possibility that life may have once existed on Mars is becoming increasingly likely, and NASA's upcoming Mars missions will continue to search for evidence of past life on the red planet.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence is mounting that Mars was once a warm and wet world, with a global ocean that could have been hospitable to life. The discovery of an ancient ocean covering a significant portion of the Martian surface suggests that the planet was once a much more habitable place than it is today. The possibility of life once existing on Mars is becoming increasingly likely, and future missions will continue to search for evidence of past life on the red planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "Researchers at UC Berkeley have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of neuroscience, demonstrating the potential to reconstruct YouTube videos from brain activity. The team, led by Shinji Nishimoto and Jack Gallant, used functional MRI to measure the brain activity of study participants as they watched a series of YouTube videos. The researchers then developed a computer model that matched the brain activity patterns to the visual content of the videos.\n\nThe resulting videos are a blurry, dream-like interpretation of the original content, as the brain activity data layered all the YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity pattern. The researchers believe that this technology could one day offer a window into our dreams, thoughts, and even memories, as it allows for the decoding of visual experiences without visual stimuli.\n\nThe study's findings could have significant implications for the future of technology, particularly in the realm of assistive devices for individuals with paralysis. The technology could potentially allow people with paralysis to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements.\n\nHowever, the researchers caution that the technology is still in its infancy and that the potential to watch a person's dreams or memories is still a long way off. The researchers also acknowledge that the brain activity measured in this study only represents a small fraction of the activity that allows us to see moving images.\n\nThe researchers hope to build more sophisticated models that can improve the resolution of the reconstructed videos. However, they also note that the technology will require more advanced computers and larger datasets to improve its accuracy and reliability.\n\nIn conclusion, the researchers at UC Berkeley have made a significant leap in understanding how the brain processes visual experiences.

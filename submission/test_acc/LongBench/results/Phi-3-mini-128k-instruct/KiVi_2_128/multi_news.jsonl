A recent forensic investigation, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, has cast further doubt on the shroud's authenticity.\n\nThe researchers, Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, conducted a comprehensive forensic analysis of the bloodstain patterns on the Shroud of Turin. Their goal was to determine whether the bloodstains on the shroud were consistent with the bloodstains of a crucified person.\n\nTheir analysis involved seven different body parts on the shroud, including the hands, forearms, chest, and lower back. The researchers used real and synthetic blood samples to replicate the bloodstains and compared the flow of the liquid to the patterns on the shroud.\n\nThe results of the investigation were striking. The bloodstain patterns on the shroud were inconsistent with the expected bloodstain patterns of a crucified person.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Silva claims she gave it to him as a wedding gift and it's rightfully his. Now, the battle is headed to court, Page Six reports. \"It’s not [Silva’s]. It’s a treasured heirloom of the family.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

A significant finding from the University of Michigan, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, reveals that nearly one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the U.S. are diagnosed under the age of 50, a demographic typically not screened for this type of cancer. This shift in age demographics for colorectal cancer diagnoses, which are now more likely to be advanced at the time of diagnosis, to be more aggressive and potentially more deadly, has prompted a reevaluation of current screening guidelines.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Cancer, analyzed data from 1998 to 2011 and found that 15% of colorectal cancer patients were under 50. Younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, with a higher likelihood of undergoing surgery and receiving more aggressive treatments. Despite the advanced stage of cancer, younger patients lived slightly longer without a recurrence, possibly due to more aggressive treatment and younger patients receiving more aggressive treatment. Younger patients with cancer symptoms, such as anemia, bleeding, and bowel changes, are more likely to have cancer that has spread to lymph nodes or other organs.\n\nThe study's findings have raised questions about the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for colorectal cancer in younger individuals. The researchers suggest that a family history of colorectal cancer and other risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, and a poor diet, may contribute to the increase in colorectal cancer incidence among younger adults.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, has been a wake-up call to the medical community, which is now realizing that a relatively large number of colorectal cancers are occurring in young people.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

According to the Kardashev scale, civilizations can be categorized into three types based on their energy consumption and harnessing capabilities. A Type I civilization harnesses all the resources of a planet, while a Type II civilization harnesses all the energy of a star, and a Type III civilization harnesses energy from an entire galaxy.\n\nThe paper discusses the possibility of advanced civilizations using Dyson spheres, massive structures that would allow them to reach the highest level of the Kardashev scale. The paper also explores the concept of Dyson spheres and their potential forms, such as a solid shell or a cloud of satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres.\" These structures would surround a star, capturing its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe paper also delves into the concept of \"statites,\" which are satellites that remain in space without orbiting a planet or moon. These satellites would form a cloud around a star-like a cloud, known as a \"Dyson sphere,\" and beam the energy back to the home planet.\n\nThe paper also explores the possibility of finding these advanced civilizations by detecting unusual light signatures in the form of altered light spectra from distant galaxies. These signatures would indicate the presence of advanced civilizations harnessing energy from their stars in a way that would be detectable from Earth.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper suggests that the search for advanced extraterrestrial civilizations may be a race against time, as the universe continues to expand. The paper also highlights the potential for advanced civilizations to harness energy from their stars in a way that would be detectable by Earth-based observations.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

He insists that he urinated on a wall near the reservoir, not in the water itself. However, the Portland Water Bureau, along with the Multnomah County District Attorney, pursued legal action against Swonger, who was cited for trespassing and public urination.\n\nIn a separate development, Swonger was also caught on video, which led to him being labeled as a national laughing stock. He was interviewed by Vocativ, where he expressed his frustration over the situation and the potential impact on his future.\n\nMeanwhile, the Portland Water Bureau, in an effort to ensure public health, decided to flush the water from the reservoir. The Bureau's decision was based on the advice of city officials and experts, who determined that the safest course of action was to flush the water. Despite the controversy, the Bureau's decision was supported by the city's top officials, who emphasized the importance of public health and safety.\n\nIn the end, Swonger's case remains under review, with the possibility of additional charges being filed. The Portland Water Bureau continues to monitor the situation closely, and the city's reservoirs are set to remain open, with the Bureau and the city's water officials working to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nIn summary, the Portland Water Bureau's decision to flush the water from the reservoir was made in the interest of public health and safety. Despite the controversy surrounding the incident, the Bureau's actions were supported by city officials and experts, who determined that the safest course of action was to ensure the reservoir's water remained safe for consumption.", "answers": ["The Portland teen accused of peeing in a city reservoir on Wednesday insists he didn't do it—in a relatively NSFW defense. \"Yeah, it's f---ing retarded, dude,\" 18-year-old Dallas Swonger tells Vocativ in what the site calls an \"expletive-filled interview\" given as Swonger smoked a Newport cigarette. \"I didn't piss in the f---ing water.\" He explains that he did urinate, after a night of skateboarding at Mount Tabor Park, but he did so against the wall of the reservoir, not into the reservoir. \"I was like, 'Dudes I have to piss so bad.'

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR.

{"pred": "Donald Trump's Stance on Gun Control and Mental Health:\n\nDonald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, made headlines with his comments on gun control and mental health in the wake of a tragic shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. Trump, who has a concealed carry permit in New York, defended the right to bear arms and criticized the idea of gun-free zones. He argued that the shooter's mental illness was the root cause of the tragedy, not gun laws.\n\nTrump's comments on the Oregon shooting came during a campaign event in Tennessee, where he compared the situation to the 1974 film \"Death Wish.\" He suggested that if he had been armed during the shooting, it could have prevented the loss of life. Trump also compared the situation to the 1999 Columbine High School shooting in Colorado, where the shooters were also suffering from mental health issues.\n\nTrump's comments on the issue of gun control and mental health were met with mixed reactions. Some praised his stance, while others criticized it as an oversimplification of a complex issue. Trump, who has previously supported stricter gun control measures, has consistently advocated for Second Amendment rights.\n\nIn a separate development, it was revealed that Russian President Vladimir Putin had contacted the Trump campaign, but the nature of the communication and its impact on the campaign remain unclear.\n\nTrump's comments on the issue of gun control and mental health have been a recurring theme in his campaign, with the candidate promising to make America safer by focusing on self-defense and mental health care.\n\nIn conclusion, Trump's comments on the Oregon shooting highlight his belief that mental illness is the root cause of the problem, not gun control laws. Trump's comments on the issue have been criticized by some as an attempt to deflect attention from the issue of gun control and mental health.

The research, led by Geronimo Villanueva of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, suggests that an ancient ocean once covered a significant portion of the Martian surface, potentially providing a suitable environment for life to exist.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, reveals that the Martian atmosphere contains a higher concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere than on Earth. This discrepancy in deuterium levels between the two planets provides evidence that Mars was once a warmer and wetter world.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the Martian atmosphere's composition and determined that the planet's water vapor content has been steadily decreasing over time. This decline in water vapor suggests that the ocean has been steadily receding, leaving behind a much drier and colder Mars.\n\nThe study's findings support the theory that Mars was once a more habitable planet than it is today. The possibility of life on Mars is a tantalizing prospect, and the evidence that Mars was once a warm and wet world continues to mount.\n\nThe researchers' findings have significant implications for the ongoing search for life on Mars. The possibility that life could have once existed on the Red Planet is becoming increasingly more likely, and the quest to uncover the secrets of Mars' past continues.\n\nThe study's results have sparked renewed interest in the exploration of Mars, and the upcoming ExoMars rover mission by the European Space Agency and Roscosmos is set to launch in 2020. The rover's mission is to search for signs of ancient life on the Red Planet, and the findings could provide crucial insights into the planet's habitability.\n\nThe ExoMars rover, set to launch in 2020, will also play a vital role in the ongoing search for life on Mars.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The team, led by Shinji Nishimoto and Jack Gallant, conducted an experiment where subjects watched YouTube videos while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The researchers recorded the subjects' brain activity and used it to reconstruct the videos they were watching. This was achieved by matching the patterns of brain activity with the visual content of the videos, such as shapes, colors, and movements.\n\nThe brain activity patterns were measured using fMRI, which recorded the changes in blood flow to the visual cortex, which corresponded to the brain activity patterns. This allowed the researchers to reconstruct the YouTube videos based on the brain activity patterns. The resulting videos were blurry and dream-like, as they were a composite of all the YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity patterns.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the brain processes visual experiences in a way that can be decoded and reconstructed. This research has the potential to provide insights into how the brain processes and understands visual experiences.\n\nThe researchers believe that this breakthrough could lead to the development of technologies that could potentially allow for the broadcasting of imagery from the brain, which could have implications for various fields, including the potential for people with paralysis to control their environment through imagined sequences of movements. However, the researchers caution that the technology is still in its early stages and that the potential applications are yet to be fully realized.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

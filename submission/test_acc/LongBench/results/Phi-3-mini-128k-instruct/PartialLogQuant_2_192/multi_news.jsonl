The findings showed that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became more resistant to macrophage-killing and antimicrobial peptides, and were more successful in invading human cells.\n\nThe study also found that cigarette smoke exposure led to MRSA becoming more resistant to the immune system's defenses, with the resistant bacteria surviving up to four times longer than non-exposed bacteria.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

She was initially required to use the Xora app, which she found objectionable. Arias researched the app and raised concerns with her supervisor, John Stubits, who dismissed her privacy concerns and admitted to knowing her location and movements at all times.\n\nArias claims that Stubits threatened her with termination if she did not comply with the app's use, and that Intermex's President John Nelson, in a call with Stubits, also threatened her with termination. Arias alleges that this threat was a violation of her privacy and an illegal intrusion.\n\nArias seeks damages for invasion of privacy, retaliation, unfair business practices, and wrongful termination. She also alleges that Intermex interfered with her contract with NetSpend Corporation, which resulted in her dismissal.\n\nThe suit also claims that Intermex's actions were in violation of California's Invasion of Privacy Act, which prohibits employers from intentionally and unlawfully intruding upon the seclusion or solitude of an individual or any other part of their private life.\n\nArias alleges that the app's GPS function did not stop tracking her location even when she turned off her phone, and that the app's data was shared with her employer, which she found highly invasive.\n\nThe suit also claims that Intermex's actions were in violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications.\n\nArias' attorney, Gail Glick, argues that the app's invasive nature and the employer's actions were a clear violation of the law and Arias' privacy rights.", "answers": ["Myrna Arias didn't like the GPS app on her phone that constantly tracked her, so she uninstalled it.

Arias started researching the app, then called Xora—its website touts the app's ability to let employers \"instantly see where their employees are and where they have been\"—and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called. Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

Per the Chronicle, an adult also was injured in the incident. \"We lost a future leader. We lost a future athlete. We lost a child in our city,\" Melquan's former coach, acting as a spokesman for the bereaved family, tells the Chronicle. The oldest of three children, Melquan loved his family and was very protective of his siblings, he says. Multiple investigations into the incident are reportedly underway, with city officials looking into how the fence became electrified. Georgia Power, offering \"condolences and sympathy,\" said in a statement that the utility \"does not control or maintain the voltage\" that caused the electrocution. Melquan's family will hold a vigil Thursday at the Bernie Ward Community Center. \"This young man was where he needed to be,\" his former coach says, per WRDW. \"He was doing what he loved.\" (A medieval re-enactor was impaled in a freak accident.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2050}

Traditionally, colorectal cancer has been considered a disease primarily affecting the elderly, with screening typically recommended to begin at age 50. However, a comprehensive analysis of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team, found that approximately 15% of colorectal cancer patients are diagnosed before the age of 50.\n\nThis finding is significant as it suggests that colorectal cancer is no longer a disease confined to the elderly. The study, published in the journal Cancer, analyzed data from over 250,000 colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2011. It was found that one in seven colorectal cancer patients is diagnosed before the age of 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer, which had spread to lymph nodes or other organs.\n\nThe reasons for this trend are not yet fully understood, but researchers believe that environmental factors, such as diet, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity, may play a role. Additionally, the study found that younger patients lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence, even though they tended to have more aggressive disease.\n\nThese findings have prompted a reevaluation of current screening guidelines, which recommend beginning screening at age 50. The researchers suggest that the medical community should be on the lookout for colorectal cancer symptoms in younger patients, such as anemia, blood in the stool, or changes in bowel habits. They also recommend that individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer or those at higher risk should begin screening earlier than age 50.\n\nIn conclusion, the incidence of colorectal cancer among individuals under 50 is on the rise, and this trend warrants further investigation.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show. Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them.\" Head writer Ben Karlin: \"I remember seeing it in the editing room. I remember Jon called me down, and seeing it and thinking, Yeah, this is what we should be doing. This is the goal. It was one of Carell’s most incredible moments.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

His recent tweet, which depicted him body-slamming a person representing CNN, sparked controversy and criticism from various quarters.\n\nHomeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert defended the tweet, stating that the president is entitled to respond to unfair treatment on cable platforms. He also highlighted the importance of social media as a direct line of communication between the president and the American people.\n\nHowever, the tweet drew criticism from CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who accused the homeland security adviser of compromising his principles. Navarro argued that the tweet incites violence and could potentially harm someone.\n\nDespite the backlash, President Trump defended his tweet, asserting that his social media use is a modern-day presidential duty. He emphasized that he won the 2016 election with the help of social media and is determined to continue using it to communicate directly with the American people.\n\nIn response to concerns about the president's tweet, Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert defended the president's right to communicate directly with the American people through social media.

During these raids, federal agents confiscated wood from Gibson's facilities in Nashville and Memphis, disrupting production and causing significant financial harm to the company.\n\nThe Gibson Guitar Corporation has consistently denied any wrongdoing, asserting that all the wood used in their instruments has been sourced legally. The company has presented documents to support their claims, and they maintain that the wood seized during the recent raid was legally obtained.\n\nThe Lacey Act, which requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, has been at the center of this controversy. Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, has stated that the company has not been charged with any crime and that they have not made any decisions that would have violated the Lacey Act.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has also weighed in on the matter, stating that the Lacey Act is an important tool in the fight against illegal logging and that Gibson's actions, if true, would be a serious violation of the law.

Scientists have determined that the Martian water vapor in the atmosphere is enriched with deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, compared to the more common form of hydrogen. This enrichment suggests that Mars has lost a significant amount of its water over time.\n\nThe research team, led by Geronimo Villanueva, used data from the Keck II telescope and the Infrared Telescope Facility to analyze the Martian atmosphere.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party.

The study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego School of Medicine, found that cigarette smoke can make MRSA more resistant to the body's immune defenses, potentially leading to more severe infections.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, revealed that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became more resistant to macrophages, the immune cells that typically kill bacteria. The bacteria were found to be more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, two key components of the immune response. Furthermore, the bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke were better able to invade human cells and cause infections in mice.\n\nThe researchers also found that the effects of cigarette smoke on MRSA were long-lasting, with the enhanced resistance persisting for up to 24 hours after exposure. This persistence, combined with the fact that MRSA can divide every 30 minutes, means that a single cigarette smoke-exposed bacterium could potentially generate over a billion descendants in just 12 hours.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms the smoker but also strengthens the pathogens they are exposed to.

This enhanced resistance could make MRSA infections more difficult to treat and potentially more deadly.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, as they suggest that smoking cigarettes could make MRSA infections even more dangerous.

However, the researchers' work remains a significant contribution to understanding the interconnected web of knowledge and the influence of historical figures like Linnaeus.\n\nIn a related development, the Internet Archive has been working on archiving web pages and references, with the goal of preserving the web's history and ensuring that references to historical figures and their work are maintained. The archive aims to fix all broken links on the web and provide a companion link to the original version of a page, allowing people to see the original content and references.\n\nIn conclusion", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person. Second place goes to Michael Jackson, and third to Pope Pius XII. When factoring in all 24 language editions of the online encyclopedia, the team found that Adolf Hitler ranked the most important person, while Michael Jackson was again second and Madonna third, reports the Guardian. \"Our analysis shows that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

The second pregnancy, which ended in 1996, was a result of an ectopic pregnancy, which was medically necessary to terminate. Davis' memoir, which goes on sale Tuesday, reveals that the ectopic pregnancy was a result of a fertilized egg implanting outside the uterus, which is not sustainable and can endanger the mother's life. Davis' decision to terminate the second pregnancy was made after a severe fetal abnormality was detected. The fetus had a severe brain abnormality, and the doctors initially did not consider it a concern. However, a later examination revealed that the fetus had a complete separation of the brain on the right and left sides. Davis' memoir also details her struggles to pay the bills after her first divorce and her journey to graduate from Harvard Law School.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

{"pred": "Recent studies and data analyses have highlighted a concerning trend in the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among individuals under the age of 50, a demographic typically not considered at high risk for this disease. Traditionally, CRC has been viewed as a condition affecting older adults, with screening recommended to begin at age 50. However, new research indicates that nearly 15% of CRC patients are diagnosed before reaching this age threshold. This shift in the age of diagnosis suggests that CRC is no longer predominantly a disease of the elderly and that younger individuals are also at risk.\n\nThe implications of this shift are significant. A study led by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team at the University of Michigan, published in the journal Cancer, analyzed data from over 250,000 patients diagnosed with CRC between 1998 and 2011. The findings revealed that 1 in 7 patients were diagnosed with CRC before reaching the age of 50. Younger patients with CRC were more likely to have advanced disease, but they also received more aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy, which may have contributed to their longer survival rates.\n\nThe study also found that younger patients were more likely to have their cancer recur or progress to a more advanced stage, with a five-year survival rate of 95.1% for localized tumors, compared to 91.3% for regional disease, and 96.3% for distant disease. Despite the more aggressive treatment approach, these patients lived slightly longer without a recurrence of cancer.\n\nThe study's findings have raised questions about the current CRC screening guidelines and whether they should be adjusted to begin at a younger age. However, the authors caution that it is not yet clear whether altering screening guidelines would prevent more cancer deaths.\n\nThe study's findings have been published in the journal Cancer, with the authors emphasizing the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger patients. They also note that the reasons for the increase in CRC among younger adults are not yet fully understood, but factors such as lifestyle and environmental influences may play a role.\n\nIn light", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "In a groundbreaking study, scientists have proposed a three-step process for advanced civilizations to harness energy from their stars and beyond. The process, outlined by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, involves harnessing all the energy of a planet (Type I), all the energy of a star (Type II), and all the energy of an entire galaxy (Type III). Recent research by Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations might overcome the limitations of the universe's expansion by capturing energy from stars in distant galaxies. This would involve creating a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to capture and beam the energy back to the civilization's home planet.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres has been a staple of science fiction, with authors like Olaf Stapledon and Freeman Dyson exploring the idea in their works. Dyson's proposal for a swarm of satellites around a star, rather than a solid shell, would allow for a more stable and feasible approach to capturing stellar energy.\n\nThe search for advanced civilizations is further complicated by the presence of dark energy, which causes the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. This expansion limits the observable universe and the potential for civilizations to interact with distant stars. However, the presence of a civilization determined to maximize its energy usage could be detected by the movement of stars within a galaxy, as well as the unusual light signatures emitted by a galaxy with a disrupted star population.\n\nIn conclusion, the search for advanced civilizations and their methods of energy harnessing is a complex and evolving field of study. The presence of a civilization determined to maximize its energy usage could be detected by the movement of stars and unusual light signatures emitted by a galaxy with disrupted stars. The search for advanced civilizations is an ongoing effort that combines scientific research and the exploration of the cosmos.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

Despite his hearing impairment, Kieran has been able to hear better with the help of a hearing aid.\n\nKieran's parents, David and Louise Sorkin, have been supportive of their son's desire to have a pair of ears. Kieran, who has struggled with social acceptance due to his appearance, has expressed a strong wish for a normal pair of ears since he was six years old.\n\nThe surgery, which took place at Great Ormond Street Hospital, involved a team of specialists led by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode. The operation, which took six hours, involved removing cartilage from Kieran's ribs, shaping it, and attaching it to the back of his head using skin flaps. The procedure was not only cosmetic but also provided Kieran with the ability to hear sounds like wind and birds tweeting, which he could not do before.\n\nThe psychological benefits of the surgery have been significant for Kieran. He has expressed happiness and a desire for a normal pair of ears, which he can now see in a mirror. The surgery has also boosted Kieran's self-esteem and social interactions.\n\nThe surgery was based on a template of Kieran's mother's ears to ensure a natural look. The team at Great Ormond Street Hospital, which performs around 40 such surgeries each year, has also been working on advancements in tissue engineering. They are researching ways to grow ear frameworks from a patient's own stem cells, which could potentially eliminate the need for rib cartilage in the future.\n\nIn summary, Kieran Sorkin, a boy born without ears, has had a life-changing surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital. The operation, which involved using Kieran's own rib cartilage to create a pair of ears, has not only improved his hearing but also his overall quality of life. The surgery has brought Kiern a newfound confidence and the ability to hear", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less. Born deaf with no ears, Kieran was able to hear because of an implanted hearing aid, but he still wanted ears. \"I want people to stop asking me questions,\" he told the BBC. \"I'd like just to look like my friends. I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

The panda, which had wandered into the farmland of Guan Quanzhi, a farmer in the village of Liziba, was chased by other villagers and other local wildlife officials in an attempt to capture it. The panda bit Guan's leg, causing him to suffer severe injuries. Guan underwent eight surgeries over the course of a year, and the incident has raised concerns about the potential need for an amputation.\n\nIn response to the attack, Guan's son filed a lawsuit against the local forestry officials, the nearby Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, and the local government.

The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes. Prosin, meanwhile, says her group isn't stopping with the chimps and will also target the release of other animals.

The Gibson Guitar Corporation, known for its iconic guitars, has been accused of sourcing wood from Madagascar, a country where a ban on logging was implemented in 2009 due to a coup creating an illegitimate government.

This suggests that Mars was at least habitable in the distant past, with the potential for life.\n\nThe evidence comes from a series of infrared telescope observations that reveal the Martian atmosphere's chemical composition. The data shows that Mars had a much higher concentration of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, compared to Earth. This difference in deuterium levels indicates that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than 60% of the current water in the planet's atmosphere.\n\nThe researchers calculate that the ancient ocean on Mars covered a significant portion of the planet's surface, with a depth of around 137 meters.

The presence of water on Mars in the past, and the potential for life, is a significant step forward in understanding the red planet's history and potential for life.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that Mars was once much warmer and wetter than it is today.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

He charms.\" There's also \"combustible chemistry\" between Smith and Robbie, but the movie just \"disappoints,\" Rea writes. \"Even if you're willing to forgive its sinkhole plotholes and farthest-fetched conceits, the film ... ultimately makes no sense.\" Betsy Sharkey, on the other hand, says this \"rom-com-con\" is \"an irresistible reminder of all the reasons we first fell for the Fresh Prince so many years ago.\" Writing at the Los Angeles Times, she notes the romantic role of Nicky fits Smith perfectly, while Robbie is \"more than holding her own\" as his match. \"The scams are Rubik's Cube complicated, but what keeps you guessing is whether the romantic connection between Jess and Nicky is real or just another con.\" But Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle isn't convinced. In a review titled \"Will Smith just stole $12 from your pocket,\" he argues Focus is \"ridiculous in every detail. It's a movie with no truth that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it.\" Nicky and Jess lack \"impact,\" partly because \"Smith is not a strong leading man,\" he says.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

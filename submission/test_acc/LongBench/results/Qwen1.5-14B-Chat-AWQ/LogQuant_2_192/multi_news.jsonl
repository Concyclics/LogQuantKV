A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine revealed that MRSA becomes more virulent and difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. The smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, thereby enhancing its survival and invasiveness.\n\nIn a previous study, e-cigarette vapor was also found to affect MRSA resistance, although the effect was less pronounced than that of cigarette smoke. The research suggests that cigarette smoke acts as an alarm for MRSA, triggering a defense mechanism that increases its resistance to host immune responses. This heightened resistance persists for a considerable duration after exposure, posing a significant challenge for treating infections caused by these bacteria, especially in smokers.\n\nThe findings highlight the dual threat posed by smoking – not only to smokers' health but also to the effectiveness of medical treatments.

Each cheerleader will receive $2,500 per season, with additional payments of up to $400 for those who participated in photo shoots. The lawsuit, initiated by cheerleader Krystal C. in 2014, alleged that the cheerleaders were underpaid, making only $150 per game and no money for practice time. The Jets denied the claims but agreed to settle to avoid further legal proceedings.\n\nThis settlement follows a trend among NFL cheerleading squads, as other teams have faced similar lawsuits. The Buffalo Bills' cheerleaders, the Jills, recently secured class-action status against the team, while the New York Jets' case mirrors the Buffalo Bills' situation, where cheerleaders were paid less than the minimum wage.

{"pred": "Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM), a mysterious and rapidly spreading condition resembling polio, has gained attention in the United States with a significant increase in cases this year. As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from last year's total by that time. AFM primarily affects children, with symptoms including sudden muscle weakness, paralysis, and in some cases, respiratory issues. The disease is believed to be linked to viral infections, particularly enteroviruses like EV-D68, although the exact cause remains uncertain.\n\nIn 2014, a surge in AFM cases coincided with an EV-D68 outbreak, leading to speculation that the virus might be a factor. However, no definitive link has been established, and this year, while EV-D68 cases have not reached the scale of 2014, health officials are monitoring the situation closely. The condition predominantly affects children aged 7, and recovery rates are often partial, with only a minority fully recovering.\n\nThe lack of a specific treatment has prompted research into potential therapies like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Prozac. The CDC is urging vigilance and reporting of cases to track any patterns or clusters. While the rise in cases alarms some experts, it is unclear if it indicates a repeat of the 2014 outbreak or simply increased reporting.\n\nParents and healthcare professionals are concerned about the condition's rapid spread and the need for more information and understanding. The rarity of AFM, with only a few dozen cases annually, makes it challenging to draw definitive conclusions. However, the recent surge in cases has prompted researchers like Dr. Kenneth Tyler at the University of Colorado to study the virus's impact on mice, hoping to find potential treatments.\n\nAffected families, like the Roberts and Andersen households, are grappling with the sudden onset of paralysis in their children, raising concerns about the need for more awareness and research. The CDC is urging good hygiene practices to prevent the spread of potential triggers like enteroviruses.\n\nIn summary, Acute Flaccid Myelitis, a mysterious and potentially polio-like illness, is on the rise in the US, with a significant increase in cases this year. The cause remains uncertain, but enteroviruses, particularly EV-D68, are being investigated. The condition affects mainly children, causing rapid paralysis and highlighting the need for further research and public health measures.", "answers": ["At first, it seemed like 4-year-old Laura Carson was suffering from a simple headache.

Researchers, including Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the University of Pavia, have performed a bloodstain pattern analysis on the fabric, challenging its authenticity. Using live subjects and mannequins, they tested various blood flow scenarios, such as trickles from wounds on the left hand, forearms, and a simulated spear wound, comparing them to the patterns observed on the Shroud.\n\nTheir study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found that the bloodstain patterns on the shroud do not match those expected from a crucifixion scenario.

The spear wound pattern, for instance, did not align with the expected flow from a hanging victim.\n\nWhile the shroud's radiocarbon dating places it within a timeframe consistent with the Middle Ages, the forensic analysis casts doubt on its historical significance.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

He lied about a $2 billion transfer of assets to trusts, which he said led to Forbes removing him from the 2017 Forbes 400 list. Ross' confirmation to President Trump's administration raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, as he failed to disclose several lawsuits and under-reported his assets in official filings.\n\nDuring his tenure, Ross' credibility was further called into question due to a shipping company connection involving close associates of Vladimir Putin and his handling of the International Steel Group, where he reportedly exaggerated his role and lied about assets. His confirmation as commerce secretary was met with skepticism, as he had a reputation for dishonesty, including lying about his net worth, padding his assets, and omitting crucial information in his financial disclosures.\n\nTrump appointed Ross to his cabinet, knowing his wealth, believing it would bring a level of expertise to the position. However, Trump's own comments about preferring wealthy individuals for key roles echoed a pattern of favoritism.

Research has shown that children in institutions face higher risks of abuse, malnutrition, and developmental issues compared to those in family-based care.\n\nInstitutionalization, even in well-resourced facilities, is not a solution; instead, investments in education, health support, and alternative care options like fostering or adoption are advocated.

The fossil also revealed insights into the evolution of paravians, with Caihong differing from other known dinosaurs in various aspects, such as its dentary and forelimb proportions. The presence of feathers on the dinosaur's tail, similar to those of birds, suggests that feathers might have played a role in aerodynamics even before the origin of flight.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation.

The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

After being spotted on the show, the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office removed her from the missing persons list. Rebekah's case highlights the issue of missing persons in Humboldt County, which has the highest per-capita rate of missing persons in California, as reported by the Attorney General's office.\n\nThe county's high rate of missing persons is not due to a surge in cold cases or serial killings, but rather a combination of factors. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office attributes the high number of reports to a relatively liberal policy for accepting missing persons reports and the transient nature of the cannabis industry, which attracts people who may go uncontacted for extended periods. The department receives many reports of runaways, both adults and children, but most are resolved quickly, with many cases involving temporary disappearances or voluntary absences.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office is actively searching for missing individuals, including a 47-year-old man named Mitchell Hernandez, who vanished with a possible mental health issue. The case underscores the ongoing efforts to locate missing persons, even after years, as seen in the case of Karen Mitchell, a teenager who disappeared in 1997.\n\nPrivate investigator Todd Matthews, founder of the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), points out that standardization of missing persons reporting across jurisdictions is crucial for a comprehensive search. Families of missing individuals face challenges in navigating the system and maintaining communication with law enforcement, as seen in the case of Vikki Joseph, whose brother Jeff disappeared in 2014, with his case remaining unsolved despite extensive efforts by his family.\n\nIn conclusion, while Humboldt County's high rate of missing persons is partly due to the transient nature of its residents and the openness of its reporting policy, the local law enforcement agencies are committed to finding those who are truly missing, as exemplified by Rebekah Martinez's case and the ongoing searches for others.", "answers": ["It turns out missing people are pretty easy to find when they appear every week in your living room.

Researchers found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen, a commonly recommended pain reliever, had a higher likelihood of their children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related issues. The study, conducted on 64,000 Danish children, observed a correlation between acetaminophen use and a 29% increased risk of ADHD when taken chronically or for extended periods. While the study does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, it suggests that pregnant women may want to reconsider frequent use of acetaminophen, especially for managing minor aches and pains.\n\nExperts caution that the findings are not definitive and more research is needed. Some suspect that acetaminophen's potential impact on fetal development might be due to its hormone-like effect on the developing brain. Other studies have hinted at a possible connection between acetaminophen and ADHD, though the mechanisms are not fully understood. ADHD rates are on the rise, but it's unclear if the observed association is solely due to acetaminophen or other factors.\n\nThe study authors advise pregnant women to weigh the risks and consider alternative methods for pain relief, such as non-pharmacological treatments like massages, baths, or acupuncture.

Democrats, led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, are refusing to budge on any changes to the ACA, fearing it could lead to a shutdown if Republicans don't accept a clean bill.

His team, including Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have presented evidence of a massive planet, referred to as \"Planet Nine\" or \"Planet X,\" which they believe lies at the edge of the solar system, causing gravitational anomalies in the orbits of distant dwarf planets.\n\nBrown and Batygin's research, published in the Astronomical Journal, suggests the existence of a ninth planet with an estimated mass between five to 10 times that of Earth, making it potentially larger than Pluto. However, they have not directly observed the planet but instead inferred its presence based on the gravitational influence it exerts on nearby objects.

This shift, as seen in a study by the University of Michigan, calls for reevaluation of current screening guidelines, which typically recommend starting at age 50. Younger patients are at a higher risk of having advanced or spreading tumors, but they also tend to have slightly longer survival rates due to more aggressive treatment.\n\nThe study, examining data from 1998 to 2011, found that nearly 15% of colorectal cancer patients were under 50, with younger patients being more likely to have advanced disease and requiring surgery or radiation therapy at a higher rate than their older counterparts.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through resource acquisition.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's theory proposes a three-step progression for civilizations seeking to dominate the universe. The first step involves utilizing a planet's resources (Type I), followed by harnessing a star's energy (Type II), and eventually capturing energy from an entire galaxy (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that civilizations must actively capture energy from distant stars to prevent being isolated due to the expanding universe's dark energy. As space expands, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible, necessitating proactive measures to secure energy sources.\n\nHooper argues that advanced civilizations would actively seek to surround stars with Dyson spheres, massive solar-powered satellites forming a cloud around the star to harvest its energy. This would enable them to counteract the effects of dark energy and ensure continued access to resources. While humanity is currently in the early stages of this process, more advanced civilizations might have already reached higher levels of technological advancement.\n\nOlaf Stapledon's science fiction and physicist Freeman Dyson's theories suggest that such structures could be detected through their waste heat and unusual light signatures. Dyson spheres, potentially consisting of millions of statites (solar-powered satellites), would be indicators of an advanced civilization's ambitions.\n\nThe quest for interstellar communication and resource acquisition connects to the search for extraterrestrial life, as civilizations would prioritize securing energy sources before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe.

Initially, Stewart took over the show in 1999, replacing Craig Kilborn, amidst tensions with the existing staff who were resistant to his vision. Stewart's appointment was met with skepticism, particularly from some writers who felt their established format was being disrupted. He faced challenges in asserting his authority and reshaping the show's tone, pushing for a more pointed and purposeful approach.\n\nBen Karlin, a writer with a similar point of view, was brought in as head writer, and their collaboration marked a shift in the show's focus from mocking the news for laughs to criticizing and exposing political hypocrisy. The early years saw Jon Stewart grappling with the writers' resistance, leading to confrontations and power struggles, including a notorious \"fuck-you meeting\" and a leaked \"fuck-off\" memo.\n\nSteve Carell and Stephen Colbert, two key performers, joined the show, with Carell's addition helping Stewart assert control. Colbert's presence, combined with the hiring of new writers like Ben Karlin and D.J. Javerbaum, brought a fresh perspective and a more aggressive political stance. The show's coverage of the 2000 presidential campaign, particularly a memorable segment where Jon Stewart grilled Senator John McCain, marked a turning point, demonstrating the potential of the show to delve into political satire and hold public figures accountable.\n\nThroughout the early years, The Daily Show evolved from a niche comedy show to a cultural phenomenon, challenging the traditional news format and influencing the way audiences perceived political commentary.

The operation, while initially cosmetic, holds significant psychological benefits, boosting Kieran's self-esteem and enabling him to better fit in with his peers. The surgery, which took six hours, was performed by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, who emphasized the importance of achieving balance between the new ears.\n\nKieran's case highlights the potential of ear reconstruction surgery, which is not only about enhancing appearance but also about psychological well-being.

Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, maintained that the company had purchased the wood legally, but the government claimed that emails and seized documents suggested the company was aware of the potential illegality.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), represented by Director Andrea Johnson, accused Gibson of knowingly sourcing wood from Madagascar despite a ban on exports due to the country's political situation. Johnson stated that Gibson had taken steps to ensure a legal supply chain but had still engaged in potentially illegal activity. Gibson denied the allegations and argued that they had followed all necessary regulations, including documentation supporting their compliance with US and Malagasy laws.\n\nThe situation raised concerns among other guitar manufacturers, such as C.F. Martin & Co., who faced potential retroactivity issues with the Lacey Act's enforcement.

{"pred": "Recent studies based on observations of Mars' atmosphere have revealed significant discoveries about the planet's ancient water history. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a substantial portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, which reached depths of up to a mile, persisted for millions of years, providing a potentially habitable environment for life. Mars' water loss, primarily due to the thinning atmosphere, led to the depletion of the ocean, leaving behind a global ocean that could have been up to 137 meters deep.\n\nThe water on Mars was initially enriched in deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, due to the gradual escape of ordinary hydrogen into space. This enrichment indicates extensive water loss over billions of years. The maps of atmospheric water and its deuterium content show a significant difference in enrichment levels across the planet, with higher values in low-altitude areas and lower values in high altitudes.\n\nThese findings challenge previous assumptions about Mars' water presence, suggesting a more consistent and prolonged presence of liquid water, with potential for the evolution of life. Scientists like Michael Mumma and Geronimo Villanueva, using advanced infrared telescopes, have provided compelling evidence that Mars was once a warm and wet world, with standing bodies of water that persisted for longer periods than previously thought.\n\nThe upcoming Exomars rover mission and ongoing research, such as the detection of methane on Mars, further emphasize the possibility of past habitability on the planet. While the search for life continues, the accumulating evidence points to Mars' past as a more hospitable environment, making the case for the study of astrobiology on Mars even stronger.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "In a recent legal development, the European Court of Justice has dismissed appeals by both Nestlé and Mondelez, the makers of Kit Kat and Cadbury, respectively, regarding the shape of the iconic four-fingered chocolate bar. Nestlé had been attempting to maintain a trademark on the shape of its Kit Kat since 2002, arguing that it was distinctive enough to be protected. However, the court ruled that the shape alone does not confer sufficient distinctiveness to warrant trademark protection, requiring evidence of recognition across all EU member states, which Nestlé has so far failed to provide.\n\nThe ruling affects not only Kit Kat but also other similar products like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which has a similar four-fingered design. The case highlights the challenge for companies to prove that a product's shape is distinctive enough to be trademarked, with the court emphasizing that it must be recognizable in every EU market.\n\nThis decision could lead to a reconsideration of Nestlé's EU trademark, potentially opening the door for competitors to create similar treats without infringing on the Kit Kat brand. While Nestlé remains hopeful to continue the fight, the outcome suggests a stricter standard for proving distinctiveness in the future.\n\nIn related legal battles, Nestlé's attempt to trademark the shape of a Toblerone bar was successful, while Mondelez faced a loss in a case involving Lindt's gold-wrapped Easter bunnies, where the shape of the product was not enough to secure a trademark. The Kit Kat case has broader implications for trademark law, particularly for companies operating in a single market with varying national laws and consumer perceptions.\n\nThe ruling has consequences for the chocolate industry, as it underscores the need for strong evidence of distinctiveness across all EU markets for a trademark to stand. The Kit Kat shape may no longer be protected at the EU level, but the case may not be entirely closed, as Nestlé could still present new evidence to support its claim.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic roar of the T. rex, suggesting that dinosaurs, including the mighty predator, likely made sounds quite different from what we see in movies like \"Jurassic Park.\" According to a study published in the journal Evolution, dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies like birds, might have produced closed-mouth vocalizations akin to cooing or mumbles, unlike the high-pitched roars often associated with them. The study, involving researchers from various institutions, analyzed the vocalizations of living and extinct animals, including birds and crocodiles, to identify a pattern of closed-mouth sounds, which are more common in birds with large bodies such as doves or ostriches.\n\nThe sounds in \"Jurassic Park\" were created using a mix of real-life animal recordings, with the T. rex roar derived from a combination of baby elephant cries, tiger growls, and an alligator's gurgle. The film's raptors, on the other hand, had elements of a goose's hiss, reflecting the possibility that dinosaurs might have communicated with similar throaty sounds.\n\nThe study also highlights the potential for closed-mouth vocalizations in dinosaurs, particularly in large-bodied species, which could have resembled the cooing of pigeons or the mumble of an ostrich. While the fossil record lacks definitive evidence, the researchers speculate that dinosaurs, like birds, might have had air sacs that enabled them to produce low-frequency vocalizations.\n\nThe research findings challenge the traditional image of dinosaurs as loud, mammalian-roaring beasts and open up new avenues of exploration. As the study authors note, the evolution of vocal communication in dinosaurs is still largely a mystery, with only a fraction of dinosaur species studied, leaving ample room for future discoveries.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The search initially focused on an area based on initial data, but as new information emerged, like the suspected deliberate diversion, the search area expanded or contracted accordingly. Bayesian calculations involve estimating probabilities for each latitude-longitude combination, considering the probability of the plane being intact or damaged, and adjusting for overlapping factors like weather conditions and search history.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian analysis played a crucial role in locating the wreckage after multiple failed searches. The search team, using Metron Scientific Solutions' methods, accounted for factors like beacon functionality, crash-related damage, and the probability of detection, leading to the eventual discovery of the plane.\n\nHowever, experts caution that Bayesian techniques, while powerful, require subjective judgment and careful consideration of conflicting information.

A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine has demonstrated that MRSA becomes more virulent and difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. The smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it more resistant to the body's immune defenses, such as reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides. The bacteria can also adhere better to human cells, facilitating their invasion.\n\nIn a separate study, conducted by the same team, e-cigarette smoke was found to have similar effects but to a lesser extent compared to traditional cigarette smoke.

The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7 during the 2014 outbreak, and symptoms include sudden muscle weakness, particularly in limbs and respiratory issues.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak was linked to enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), but the CDC is still investigating the cause, as no definitive link has been established.

The CDC is urging vigilance and monitoring, with cases reported in multiple states, including California, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, and New York.\n\nTreatment options are limited, with physical therapy and, in some cases, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) being tried. Recovery rates for children vary, with only a minority fully recovering.

Researchers, led by Matteo Borrini of Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli of the University of Pavia, have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth using Bloodstain Pattern Analysis. Their study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, challenges the authenticity of the shroud by revealing inconsistencies in the blood flow patterns that do not match those expected from a crucifixion scenario.\n\nThe researchers found that the bloodstains on the shroud, particularly on the hand, forearm, and spear wound, do not align with the positions a crucified or hanging individual would have experienced. The bloodstains on the cloth suggest a standing model was used to create the imprints, rather than a life-sized representation of a crucifixion. The study also highlights discrepancies in the blood flow, with some stains indicating a 45-degree angle, which is incompatible with the expected positions of a crucified person.\n\nWhile the shroud's age, estimated between 1260 and 1390 CE through radiocarbon dating, and its linen fabric are consistent with the time period, the forensic analysis casts doubt on its historical significance.

This dinosaur, with feathers resembling those of hummingbirds, had rainbow-colored plumage, making it the first known dinosaur with iridescent feathers. The feathers were detected through microscopically preserved melanosomes, suggesting a more colorful world than previously thought. Caihong had a theropod-like body, Velociraptor-like skull, and a crested head, but its dinosaurian features like a short tail indicate it was not capable of sustained flight, though its feathers may have served for display purposes.\n\nThe dinosaur's fossil, with preserved feathers on the head, neck, and body, indicates a mix of long, linear feathers and short, sinuous ones. It had a small, possibly ornamental, crest above its eyes. Caihong's dinosaurian traits, such as its short limbs and probable hunting habits, suggest it was a ground dweller with a possible role in attracting mates.\n\nThe study also highlights the diversity of feather evolution in paravians, with Caihong's feathers differing from those of other theropods in terms of shape, size, and arrangement. The presence of iridescent feathers in Caihong and other early dinosaurs like Anchiornis suggests that colorful displays may have played a role in dinosaur communication.\n\nThe discovery of melanosomes in Caihong's feathers suggests that the dinosaur's plumage was likely black with iridescence, similar to the vibrant colors seen in modern birds.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation.

Rebekah's case highlights the issue of missing persons in Humboldt County, which has the highest per-capita rate of missing persons in California, according to the Attorney General's database.\n\nThe county's high rate of missing persons is not due to a surge in cold cases or serial killings, as previously speculated. Instead, it is attributed to factors such as the lenient reporting policy, a large transient population, and the high number of cannabis workers who may go uncontacted for extended periods. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office receives numerous reports, with many cases being resolved quickly due to the transient nature of the cannabis industry workers.\n\nThe Humboldt 35, a list of 35 people featured in a newspaper exposé, includes both adults and children, with some cases dating back to 1977.

Researchers found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen, a commonly recommended pain reliever, had a higher likelihood of their children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related issues. The study, conducted on 64,000 Danish children, observed a correlation between acetaminophen use and a 29% increased risk of ADHD when taken chronically or for extended periods. While the study does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, it suggests that pregnant women may want to reconsider long-term use or limit its intake, especially if they experience frequent pain.\n\nExperts caution that the findings are not definitive and more research is needed. Some suspect that acetaminophen's hormone-like effect on fetal development might be a factor, but other factors like viral infections or genetic predispositions could also play a role. ADHD diagnoses are on the rise, but the study authors emphasize the need for a balanced risk assessment, as antibiotics are sometimes prescribed during pregnancy despite potential risks.\n\nThe study authors advise pregnant women to weigh the benefits and risks, and consider alternative methods for pain relief, such as non-pharmacological treatments.

Now, he and his colleague Konstantin Batygin have presented compelling evidence for a potential ninth planet, which they call \"Planet Nine\" or \"Planet X.\" Based on mathematical models and the gravitational influence on distant dwarf planets, they estimate its mass to be between five to 10 times that of Earth, making it a significant addition to the solar system's architecture.\n\nThe existence of Planet Nine would challenge current models of the solar system's formation and dynamics. Its orbit would be far beyond Pluto, causing astronomers to reconsider the definition of a planet, as it would meet the criteria of having a significant gravitational pull on nearby objects. While Planet Nine has not been directly observed, its indirect evidence suggests a massive planet lurking at the edge of the solar system, potentially altering the orbits of smaller bodies like Eris.\n\nBrown, known colloquially as the \"Pluto Killer\" due to his role in Pluto's reclassification, is optimistic about the discovery, believing it could lead to a new understanding of the solar system's history. However, he acknowledges that the confirmation of Planet Nine's existence will require direct observation, and its discovery could potentially redefine the planetary boundary, as Pluto's demotion was.

The movie, \"Detroit,\" directed by Bigelow and co-written with Mark Boal, explores the systemic racism and police violence during the height of the riots, which left 43 dead and thousands injured.\n\nThe film, known for its stark and unflinching portrayal of the events, examines the moral dilemma faced by some police officers, while also highlighting the deep-rooted racial tensions in the city. It contrasts the actions of a white police officer, Will Poulter's character, with the broader context of the Detroit riots, which were fueled by the city's racial disparities.\n\n\"Anger\" and \"Detroit\" both address the Algiers Motel incident, with \"Detroit\" focusing on the nightmarish events and the Algiers Motel siege, where innocent bystanders, including musicians and tourists, became targets.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through resource acquisition and energy harvesting.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's theory proposes a three-step progression for civilizations seeking to dominate the universe. The first step involves utilizing a planet's resources (Type I), followed by harnessing a star's energy (Type II), and eventually capturing energy from an entire galaxy (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that civilizations must actively capture energy from distant stars to prevent being isolated due to the expanding universe's dark energy. As space expands, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible, necessitating proactive measures to secure energy sources.\n\nHooper argues that advanced civilizations would comprehend the importance of securing energy, leading to the construction of Dyson spheres or other mega-structures, such as solar-powered satellite swarms, to capture and utilize starlight. These structures, like Olaf Stapledon's \"light-trapping gauze\" or Freeman Dyson's envisioned energy collectors, would be designed to withstand the challenges of gravitational stability and efficiently capture energy.\n\nThe quest for energy efficiency becomes a race against time, as civilizations strive to reach Type II or III status before the universe's expansion renders their energy sources unreachable. Oldest civilizations, like those described in science fiction, might have already begun harvesting stars and could potentially be detected by their unusual light signatures, such as shifted starlight due to energy extraction.\n\nWhile humanity is currently at a relatively early stage, the possibility of encountering alien civilizations that have surpassed these milestones remains a topic of scientific speculation and intrigue. As astronomers continue to search for signs of life, the race against cosmic isolation adds an intriguing layer to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "The news passages detail the evolution of Jon Stewart's tenure as host of The Daily Show on Comedy Central. Beginning with comedian Jon Stewart replacing Craig Kilborn in 1999, the show underwent significant changes. Stewart initially faced resistance from the existing writers, who were resistant to his vision for the show. He clashed with the staff over the direction he wanted to take, which he described as more pointed and purposeful. Key hires like Ben Karlin, a fellow comedian, brought a fresh perspective, focusing on hypocrisy and political issues. The show shifted from a lighter, more pop culture-focused format to a more satirical and political edge, exemplified by Steve Carell's memorable interview with John McCain on the Straight Talk Express, which marked a turning point in the show's tone and direction.\n\nDuring the 2000 campaign season, The Daily Show began targeting politicians and media, distinguishing itself from traditional news formats. The show's success was fueled by Stewart's ability to connect with a younger audience, and the addition of writers like Ben Karlin and Stephen Colbert, who brought a new level of analysis and commentary. The show's format evolved to include more informed and opinionated content, often using the setup of a news program to critique current events.\n\nAs the show gained critical acclaim and popularity, it became a platform for Stewart to challenge the status quo, particularly in politics. The early years were marked by internal conflicts, but Stewart's determination and the hiring of like-minded individuals like Karlin and Colbert solidified the show's identity. The 2000 presidential campaign coverage, particularly the interaction with John McCain, showcased the show's newfound focus on deconstructing political processes.\n\nThroughout the summary, Jon Stewart's journey from uncertainty to establishing a distinct voice is highlighted, with the show transitioning from a niche comedy program to a cultural phenomenon that influenced the way people consumed news and political satire. The Daily Show's growth and impact on American politics and media landscape during Stewart's tenure are central themes.", "answers": ["Jon Stewart took over as host of the Daily Show in January 1999, but when did the program truly start becoming the Daily Show that legions of fans would come to love?

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show.

The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

Despite the animal sinking its teeth into her thumb and scratching her, Borch managed to subdue the raccoon by pushing its head into a puddle and holding it underwater until it stopped moving. The incident occurred after a raccoon believed to be rabid had been spotted earlier in the day.\n\nThis event prompted a public health warning, as animal control officials noted that when one animal tests positive for rabies, it's likely there are others in the area.

{"pred": "Recent studies based on observations of Mars' atmosphere have revealed significant discoveries about the planet's ancient water history. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a substantial portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, which reached depths of up to a mile, persisted for millions of years, providing a potentially habitable environment for life.\n\nThe water on Mars was initially abundant, with a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. The isotopic analysis of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere indicates a high concentration of deuterium, suggesting extensive water loss over time. Mars' polar reservoirs are found to be enriched in deuterium, implying a substantial amount of water loss, with the majority of the original water likely stored in the planet's ice caps.\n\nAs the Martian climate changed, the ocean gradually receded, losing most of its water due to atmospheric escape. Mars' current water content is significantly lower, with only about 13% of the ancient ocean remaining in the polar caps. This new understanding challenges previous assumptions about the sporadic presence of water on Mars and strengthens the case for the possibility of past habitability.\n\nThe upcoming Exomars rover mission and ongoing research, such as the detection of methane on Mars, continue to focus on searching for signs of life on the planet. While the existence of liquid water in the past increases the likelihood of habitability, further exploration is needed to determine if life ever arose on Mars.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

Bayesian statisticians, who have a history of assisting in locating lost objects, can help refine search areas by updating probabilities based on factors like flight path, wind patterns, and previously searched regions. The probability distribution is continually adjusted as new information emerges, considering the likelihood of an accident, deliberate diversion, or the plane's condition. Bayesian methods were instrumental in locating the wreckage of Air France Flight 447 in 2009, despite initial challenges due to unpredictable ocean currents and limited data.\n\nStatisticians, like those from Metron Scientific Solutions, analyze data from various sources, including radar, communication signals, and historical crash data, to create a probability grid for the search area. However, the search for MH370 is complicated by the new evidence suggesting a deliberate act, which shifts the focus to areas farther from the initial takeoff point. Critics and proponents of Bayesian techniques differ in their opinions on its applicability in the current search. While some argue that Bayesian methods are valuable for adapting to changing circumstances, others express concerns about the limitations of quantitative analysis when faced with a complex and rapidly evolving situation.\n\nThe hunt for MH370 highlights the importance of combining expert judgment with statistical rigor, as well as the challenge of maintaining accurate records of previous searches. The search for the plane remains ongoing, with experts acknowledging the difficulty of finding it, especially if the wreckage is lost in the vastness of the Indian Ocean.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

This lunar eclipse occurs when the full moon appears both super (at its closest point to Earth) and blue (the second full moon in a month, making it a Blue Moon). The Virtual Telescope Project, partnering with several astrophotographers, including Dean Hooper, John Stevenson, Chris Stockdale, and others from Australia and the United States, will host live streaming events to showcase the eclipse.\n\nThe total eclipse will start at 11:30 UT on January 31, visible from Australia, western USA, and parts of Asia. The moon will also rise as a Super Blue Moon above Rome, with a separate event scheduled at 16:00 UT, followed by the moon rising above the historic city's monuments. The Virtual Telescope Project's coordinator, astrophysicist Gianluca Masi, will lead the commentary during the live stream.\n\nThis event is particularly unusual due to its rarity, with the last total eclipse of a Blue Moon occurring over 150 years ago. The next such occurrence won't happen until December 31, 2028. Viewers can tune in to the Virtual Telescope Project's livestreams for a chance to witness this spectacle virtually or plan to observe it in person, with the moon appearing larger and reddened during the eclipse due to the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAdditionally, the month of January will feature two consecutive supermoons, with the first occurring on December 3 and the Blue Moon total eclipse on January 31. For those unable to view the eclipse, the Virtual Telescope Project offers online events to experience the celestial events from different locations around the world.", "answers": ["Look up at the sky on Jan. 31 and you may witness a sight unseen for 150 years.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

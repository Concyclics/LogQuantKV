A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine revealed that MRSA becomes more aggressive and difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. The smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, thereby enhancing its survival and invasiveness.\n\nIn a previous study, e-cigarette vapor was also found to affect MRSA resistance, although the effect was less pronounced than that of cigarette smoke.

The enhanced resistance persisted for at least 24 hours after exposure, indicating a potential long-lasting impact.\n\nThese findings highlight the dual threat posed by smoking – not only to smokers' health but also to the effectiveness of treatments against bacterial infections.

The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7 during the 2014 outbreak, and symptoms include rapid muscle weakness, particularly in limbs and respiratory issues.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak was linked to enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), but the CDC is still investigating the cause, with some suggesting it could be a coincidence or a new strain of EV-D68. No specific treatment has shown marked improvement, and recovery rates for children vary, with only a minority fully recovering. The condition remains rare, with cases reported in multiple states, including California, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, and New York.\n\nThe CDC is urging vigilance and monitoring, as the number of cases has raised concerns among health officials. While the cause remains uncertain, some doctors have reported improvements with treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and are exploring potential therapies. The 2014 outbreak saw 120 cases, and the 2016 surge has prompted a renewed focus on research, with some studies examining the role of EV-D68 in the development of AFM.\n\nParents and families affected by AFM, like the Roberts and Andersen families, express frustration over the lack of understanding and the long-term implications for their children's lives. The condition's sudden onset and the absence of a definitive cure highlight the need for further research and understanding of its causes and potential treatments.\n\nAs the CDC investigates, preventive measures like proper hygiene and vaccinations are emphasized to minimize the spread of potential triggers like enteroviruses.

Researchers, including Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the University of Pavia, have performed a bloodstain pattern analysis on the fabric, challenging the traditional interpretation of the stains. Using human and synthetic blood, they tested various scenarios, such as blood flow from standing and supine positions, to recreate the patterns observed on the shroud.\n\nTheir study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns, which do not align with those expected from a crucifixion victim. For instance, the blood flow angles on the shroud do not match the positions a person would have in a crucifixion scenario, suggesting a standing model was used to create the imprints. The researchers noted that the spear wound patterns and the blood flow from the lower back stain were particularly inconsistent.\n\nWhile the shroud's radiocarbon dating places it within a timeframe compatible with the life of Jesus, the forensic analysis questions its historical significance. The investigation adds to the ongoing debate about the shroud's authenticity, with some experts suggesting it may be a medieval creation or a 'didactic' representation rather than a genuine relic.\n\nThe study's findings have reignited interest in the scientific examination of the Shroud of Turin, with researchers calling for further study to determine the exact method used to create the image on the fabric.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The FBI expressed concerns about the memo's release, fearing it might expose sensitive information. President Donald Trump ultimately approved the memo's declassification, acknowledging the importance of transparency while respecting the President's role in protecting national security.\n\nThe memo alleges that the DOJ and FBI relied heavily on a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy, to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant for Page. The dossier, funded by the DNC and Clinton campaign, contained unverified information and was not disclosed to the court as fully as it should have been. The FBI was aware of Steele's political connections and potential conflicts of interest, yet the applications did not disclose them adequately. Additionally, the memo questions the credibility of the dossier due to Steele's termination for unauthorized media contacts and his anti-Trump biases.\n\nThe second passage discusses the broader context of the investigation into the DOJ and FBI's actions during the election, specifically regarding the surveillance of Carter Page and the role of FBI agents like Peter Strzok, who was involved in the surveillance and had personal biases against Trump. The existence of the dossier was seen as a basis for surveillance warrants, despite its uncorroborated nature and potential political motivations.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights concerns over the legality and potential abuse of power in the FBI's surveillance of a political figure, as well as the use of unverified information in obtaining surveillance warrants.

In 2015, the release of \"Wild\" led to a 300% increase in website traffic and a rise in the number of hikers attempting the full trail, from around 300 in 2006 to over 1,000 in 2014.\n\nThe surge has raised concerns about overcrowding, environmental impact, and safety. The Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) introduced a permit system in 2015 to manage the growing numbers, limiting daily permits to 50 hikers on the northbound trail. This is aimed at preserving fragile ecosystems, preventing resource depletion, and minimizing rescue operations. The trail's popularity, particularly among women, is increasing, with anecdotal evidence suggesting a shift from 10% to 30% female hikers.\n\nCheryl Strayed's story of self-discovery and resilience has inspired many, but the hike is not without its challenges.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

This dinosaur, with rainbow-colored feathers, is believed to be the first dinosaur with asymmetrical feathers, suggesting the potential for feather steering in flight. The dinosaur had a mix of dinosaurian and bird-like features, such as a Velociraptor-like skull, bird-like feathers, and a possible adaptation for flight, though its ability to fly is still debated. The dinosaur's vibrant feathers, particularly the iridescent ones on its head, neck, and chest, were analyzed using microstructural studies, revealing melanosomes similar to those in modern hummingbirds, indicating a possible iridescent display, possibly for mating purposes or social signaling. Caihong's unique features, including its crested head, short iridescent feathers, and a frond-shaped tail, suggest a mix of dinosaurian and avian traits, challenging our understanding of dinosaur plumage and its potential functions.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

After being spotted on the show, the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office removed her from the missing persons list. Rebekah's case highlights the issue of people being listed as missing due to various reasons, including temporary disappearances or personal choices, as well as the Humboldt County's relatively high rate of missing persons reports, which is partly attributed to the transient nature of the cannabis industry and the difficulty in distinguishing between voluntary disappearances and suspicious cases.\n\nThe Humboldt County has the highest per-capita rate of missing persons in California, with a mix of cases ranging from unexplained disappearances to those involving suspected serial killings. The county's large number of missing persons reports include both adults and children, with some cases dating back decades. The Sheriff's Office acknowledges that many cases are resolved quickly, often due to runaways or temporary disconnections, but some remain unsolved, like the cases of Karen Mitchell and the Stuarts, whose disappearance remains open.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office faces challenges in investigating cases, especially those involving the cannabis industry, as individuals may choose to remain uncontactable for extended periods. The Eureka Police Department receives around 40 missing persons reports monthly, with many cases being resolved quickly.

Researchers found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen, a commonly recommended pain reliever, had a higher likelihood of their children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related issues. The study, conducted on 64,000 Danish children, observed a correlation between acetaminophen use and a 29% increased risk of ADHD, particularly when taken for extended periods.\n\nWhile the study does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, it suggests that chronic or long-term use of acetaminophen during pregnancy might not be entirely safe. The researchers emphasize that it's not about avoiding the drug altogether, but rather advise against frequent or prolonged use until more research is done. Acetaminophen's potential impact on fetal brain development, as well as its hormonal effects, are cited as areas of concern.\n\nThe study authors, like Dr. Beate Ritz from UCLA, advise pregnant women to weigh the risks and consider alternative methods for pain relief, such as non-pharmacological treatments. However, they also note that it's crucial not to generalize the findings, as other factors like genetics and prenatal infections may play a role.\n\nDr. Jeff Chapa from Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital cautions that more research is needed to understand the relationship between acetaminophen and ADHD, and that it's essential not to assume causality without definitive evidence.

He and his colleague Konstantin Batygin argue that their evidence, based on the gravitational influence on distant dwarf planets and other small objects, strongly suggests the existence of a massive planet beyond Pluto.\n\nBrown's team's research, published in the Astronomical Journal, estimates the planet's mass as 5 to 10 times that of Earth, making it potentially larger than Pluto, which was downgraded from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006 due to a redefinition of the term by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through resource acquisition and energy harvesting.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's theory proposes a three-step progression for civilizations seeking to dominate the universe. The first step involves utilizing a planet's resources (Type I), followed by harnessing a star's energy (Type II), and ultimately capturing energy from an entire galaxy (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that civilizations must actively collect energy from distant stars to prevent being isolated due to the expanding universe's dark energy. As space expands, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible, necessitating proactive measures to secure resources.\n\nHooper argues that advanced civilizations would comprehend the need to expand and capture stars, potentially using massive structures like Dyson spheres – solar-powered satellites forming a shell around a star to extract its energy. These structures, first envisioned by science fiction writers like Olaf Stapledon and later analyzed by physicists, could indicate the presence of older, more advanced civilizations.\n\nThe quest for energy efficiency becomes crucial for survival, as civilizations strive to reach Type II or Type III status. Freeman Dyson's concept of a Dyson sphere, while initially theoretical, suggests a practical method for capturing starlight. Practical Dyson spheres would consist of numerous statites, or hovering satellites, maintaining balance through solar radiation pressure.\n\nWhile humanity is currently at a relatively early stage, with estimates placing us around a 0.7 on Kardashev's scale, the possibility of alien civilizations far more advanced than ours harvesting stars from other galaxies looms. The search for such civilizations could involve observing unusual light signatures, such as galaxies with missing prime stars or those exhibiting unusual energy emissions due to star manipulation.\n\nIn summary, the news revolves around the idea that advanced civilizations face a cosmic race against time to secure energy resources as the universe expands. Key concepts like Kardashev's types, Dyson spheres, and the importance of energy harvesting are discussed, with implications for both scientific speculation and the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Initially, Stewart took over the show in 1999, replacing Craig Kilborn, amidst tensions with the existing staff who were resistant to his vision. Stewart's appointment was met with skepticism, but his distinct point of view, characterized by a shift from mocking conventional news to a more pointed, purposeful approach, eventually led to a turning point.\n\nBen Karlin, a writer with a similar perspective, was brought in as head writer, and their collaboration marked a significant change in the show's tone. The early years were marked by clashes, particularly during a \"fuck-you meeting\" and a controversial \"fuck-you\" episode, where Stewart clashed with the writers over the direction of the show. Key hires like Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert, who brought a fresh energy and on-air chemistry, contributed to the show's growth. Carell's portrayal of a straightlaced correspondent and Colbert's satirical skills transformed the show's format, focusing on politicians and the media rather than just light-hearted mockery.\n\nThe show's coverage of the 2000 presidential campaign, particularly a memorable segment where Steve Carell grilled Senator John McCain, marked a shift in the show's focus from quirky field pieces to a more political and analytical approach. This moment, which showcased the show's ability to ask tough questions, led to increased relevance and critical acclaim. As the show evolved, it became a platform for Stewart to challenge the status quo and hold public figures accountable, setting it apart from traditional news formats.\n\nThroughout the process, Jon Stewart faced numerous challenges, including internal conflicts and external pressures, but his determination and the addition of fresh talent like Karlin and Javerbaum solidified the show's success.

{"pred": "Recent studies based on observations of Mars' atmosphere have revealed significant discoveries about the planet's ancient water history. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a substantial portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, which reached depths of up to a mile, persisted for millions of years, providing a potentially habitable environment for life.\n\nThe water on Mars was initially abundant, with a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. The isotopic analysis of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere indicates a high concentration of deuterium, suggesting extensive water loss over time. The loss of water, particularly from the polar reservoirs, is inferred to have been caused by the planet's thinning atmosphere, leading to the eventual recession of the ocean and the formation of ice caps.\n\nMars' ocean was not uniform; it pooled in low-lying areas, with some regions showing higher deuterium enrichment, indicating more water loss. The presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere, although not necessarily implying life, adds to the intrigue, as it suggests the possibility of past biological activity.\n\nWhile the current consensus is that Mars was wetter and more habitable in its past than previously thought, there is still debate about the exact extent of water and the likelihood of past life. Researchers like James Kasting acknowledge that the true amount of water may have been much greater than estimated, and the findings reinforce the case for further exploration of Mars' potential for past or present microbial existence.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

She accused Stumpf of prioritizing cross-selling, which led to the creation of fake accounts, and questioned his leadership, stating that he should be criminally investigated.\n\nWarren highlighted the disconnect between Stumpf's public statements and the bank's actions, pointing to a pattern of misbehavior that stretched over several years. She also criticized the bank's response, including the lack of punishment for senior executives and the potential for \"clawing back\" bonuses from former CEO Carrie Tolstedt.\n\nSenators from both parties questioned Stumpf on the extent of the fraud, the bank's responsibility to affected customers, and the role of cross-selling in the bank's practices. Stumpf admitted that the bank's culture may have contributed to the issue but defended cross-selling as a means to deepen customer relationships.\n\nIn addition to Warren's call for criminal investigation, Sen.

The probability distribution is updated as new information emerges, with a greater likelihood of the plane being found farther from the initial takeoff point due to the suspected deliberate diversion. Bayesian methods were successfully employed in locating the wreckage of Air France Flight 447, where Metron Scientific Solutions' calculations, considering factors like beacon detection rates and crash scenarios, helped identify the crash site.\n\nHowever, the complexity of the current search, with limited historical data and conflicting information, presents challenges. While Bayesian techniques, like those used by Metron in the Air France case, can be adaptable and useful in incorporating new evidence, critics argue that they may not be suitable when faced with drastic changes in the situation, as in the case of Flight 370. Some statisticians suggest that without concrete breakthroughs, the probability of finding the plane at this stage is slim, and the wreckage may remain undetected.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

This eclipse is unique due to the combination of a Supermoon (when the moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it appear 14% larger and 30% brighter) and a Blue Moon (the second full moon in a month). The event will be visible from various locations, including Australia, western USA, and parts of Asia, with the moon turning red during the eclipse due to the Earth's atmosphere bending the sunlight.\n\nA team of astrophotographers, led by the Virtual Telescope Project, will be capturing the eclipse, including participants from Australia, the United States, and Italy. They will also showcase the Supermoon rising above Rome and other landmarks, providing a live commentary and a virtual experience for viewers worldwide.\n\nThe next total eclipse featuring a Blue Moon won't occur until 2028 and 2037, emphasizing the rarity of this occurrence. For those unable to observe it live, virtual options are available, such as the Virtual Telescope Project's livestreams.\n\nIn addition to the lunar eclipse, the month of January will see three consecutive supermoons, with the first two occurring on December 3 and January 1.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine revealed that MRSA becomes more aggressive and difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. The smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, thereby enhancing its survival and invasiveness.\n\nIn a previous study, e-cigarette vapor was also found to affect MRSA resistance, but cigarette smoke had a significantly stronger impact, increasing resistance by a factor of 10 times.

The research demonstrated that MRSA exposed to smoke was more lethal in mice, as it invaded human cells better and caused increased mortality.\n\nThese findings highlight the dual role of smoking, not only posing health risks to smokers but also aiding pathogens like MRSA in their survival and virulence.

The CDC is investigating a potential link between AFM and enterovirus infections, but no definitive cause has been established.\n\nThe condition is particularly concerning due to its unpredictable nature and lack of effective treatments. Most cases involve temporary paralysis, with recovery varying from partial to full recovery. In 2014, only three out of 121 children fully recovered. Treatment options currently focus on supportive care, with some doctors reporting potential benefits from intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Prozac.\n\nAs of August, the CDC is monitoring the situation closely, urging increased reporting and maintaining vigilance for any clustering of cases.

Their study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found that the blood patterns are inconsistent with those expected from a crucifixion scenario.\n\nThe researchers observed that the bloodstains on the Shroud do not match the positions and angles that would be produced by a crucified or hanging individual.

The spear wound patterns and the blood flow from the lower back stain also showed discrepancies, pointing to a standing model or an artistic representation, not a life-sized, crucified figure.\n\nWhile the shroud's radiocarbon dating places it between 1260 and 1390 CE, the forensic analysis questions its historical significance.

Regional leaders, including President Alassane Ouattara, have responded by forming a diplomatic committee that threatens sanctions if the junta does not relinquish power. The international community, including the United Nations, is urging swift action to prevent a total collapse of the Malian state.\n\nThe fighting in northern Mali, particularly in Timbuktu, has raised concerns about the safety of the UNESCO World Heritage site, which could be damaged by the conflict. The rebels, a mix of Tuareg nationalists and Islamist factions, have imposed Islamic law in some areas, imposing a challenge to the existing government.

In 2015, the number of permits issued for the trail doubled, and the 2016 permit system indicates a continued rise in hikers, with a daily limit of 50 permits for Northbound thru-hikers to manage overcrowding. The surge is driven by both the book's success and the movie's influence, leading to a predicted 3,000+ hikers attempting the full trail this year.\n\nCheryl Strayed's story of self-discovery and redemption through hiking has inspired many, but concerns have arisen about inexperienced hikers flooding the trail, potentially causing environmental damage, overuse of resources, and safety issues.

This dinosaur, with feathers resembling those of hummingbirds, had rainbow-colored plumage, making it the first known dinosaur with iridescent feathers. The feathers were not only colorful but also displayed microscopic structures resembling bird-like melanosomes, suggesting a more vibrant world than previously imagined. Caihong had a theropod-like body, Velociraptor-like skull, and a crested head, but its feathers indicate a more complex evolution of feather usage, with both peneal and asymmetrical feathers. The dinosaur's unique features, such as the lacrimal crests and iridescent feathers, make it a significant find in understanding the diversity of paravians during the Jurassic period.\n\nThe dinosaur's feathers, particularly on the head, neck, and chest, were preserved in such a way that scientists could analyze the nanostructures, revealing that the fossilized melanosomes were similar to those in modern birds. This indicates that the dinosaur's feathers were likely iridescent, giving them a rainbow-like appearance. The presence of iridescence in feathers suggests that dinosaurs may have had more colorful displays for social or mating purposes, similar to modern birds.\n\nCaihong's discovery challenges our understanding of dinosaur plumage and its potential functions, as it had a mix of bird-like and dinosauric traits. The dinosaur's relatively short, but feathered tail suggests it may have had a frond-shaped tail for possible flight or display, making it a potential candidate for early avian-like behaviors. The study also highlights the diversity of feather structures in the dinosaur, with some resembling alula-like feathers found in other non-avialan theropods.\n\nOverall, Caihong juji's extraordinary fossil findings shed light on the intricate evolution of feathered dinosaurs and the potential role of coloration in their lives, pushing the boundaries of what was previously known about dinosaurian displays and the origins of avian traits.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation.

And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Researchers found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen, a commonly recommended pain reliever, had a higher likelihood of their children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related issues. The study, conducted on 64,000 Danish children, showed a correlation between acetaminophen use and a 29% increased risk of ADHD when taken chronically or for extended periods.

Democrats, led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, refuse to budge on any changes to the ACA, fearing it could lead to a shutdown if House Republicans succeed in attaching anti-Obamacare provisions to the funding bill.

Now, he and his colleague Konstantin Batygin have presented compelling evidence for a potential ninth planet, which they call \"Planet Nine\" or \"Planet X.\" This unseen planet is believed to orbit far beyond Pluto, with an estimated mass between five to 10 times that of Earth, making it the largest planet candidate discovered in recent times.\n\nTheir findings are based on the gravitational influence Planet Nine would have on nearby dwarf planets and other small objects, causing their orbits to align in a way that suggests a massive unseen body.

He expressed frustration with the constant questioning about Russia, stating that he would not telegraph his actions, such as military responses or the timing of policy announcements.\n\nDuring the conference, Trump addressed topics like the \"mess\" he inherited, including the economy, the Islamic State (ISIS), and the ongoing debate over Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Trump also defended his travel ban, which faced legal challenges, and hinted at a new version of the ban to be announced soon.\n\nAt the news conference, Trump's demeanor was a mix of self-assuredness and frustration, with occasional moments of camarader然, such as joking with a reporter about his cabinet nominee's last name.

This shift, as seen in a study by the University of Michigan, calls for reevaluation of current guidelines, which typically recommend screening at age 50. Younger patients are at a higher risk of having advanced colorectal cancer, with 15% of cases diagnosed at younger ages. They are more likely to present with regional or distant malignancies and receive more aggressive treatments, such as surgery (72% vs 63% for younger patients) and radiation therapy (53% vs 48% for younger patients).\n\nThe study highlights the need for early detection, as younger patients tend to live slightly longer despite having more advanced disease due to earlier diagnosis and treatment. However, the exact reasons for this increase in younger patients are not fully understood, with factors like lifestyle, environmental influences, and genetic predispositions being discussed.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

At the Warratyi rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a chance discovery by archaeologist Giles Hamm and aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard revealed a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, challenging the conventional timeline of human presence in Australia. The site is significant due to the presence of sophisticated tools, including sophisticated stone axes, ochre use, and evidence of interactions with megafauna like the Diprotodon optatum. The find pushes the arrival of humans in the arid regions up to 10,000 years earlier than previously thought, suggesting a rapid expansion of settlement from the coastal areas.\n\nCarbon dating of artefacts and fossils suggests human activity between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago, indicating a quicker migration than previously estimated. The site, particularly Warratyi, showcases the oldest known evidence of human settlement in the arid zone and the development of key technologies, such as the use of ochre and the presence of bone and stone tools. The discovery challenges the notion that climate change delayed human settlement in the region, with experts suggesting a more favorable environment for habitation during the initial colonization.\n\nThe site also provides insights into the coexistence and potential hunting of megafauna, with bone fragments from extinct species like Diprotodon optatum suggesting a level of interaction that questions the role of humans in the extinction of megafauna.

In 1967, the Detroit riots and the Algiers Motel incident, where three young Black men were killed by white police officers, are brought to light in a recent film by director Kathryn Bigelow. The movie, \"Detroit,\" directed by Bigelow and co-written with Mark Boal, explores the systemic racism and police violence during the height of the 1967 riots, which saw extensive destruction and loss of life.\n\nThe film, set against the backdrop of the Motor City's racial tensions, examines the actions of the Detroit Police Department, with a particular focus on the Algiers Motel incident. While not shying away from depicting the brutality and racism of some officers, it also portrays the moral dilemma faced by some within the police force and the National Guard. The movie highlights the harsh reality that even decades after the events, issues of racial inequality and police misconduct persist.\n\n\"Detroit\" is a powerful and emotionally charged film, using a blend of documentary-style filmmaking and fictional elements to recreate the atmosphere of the time. The director's choice to include scenes like the Algiers Motel siege, with its graphic depictions of violence and torture, aims to provoke a visceral response from the audience. The film's portrayal of the Algiers Motel incident, which remains unsolved, underscores the ongoing relevance of the story.\n\nThe movie also delves into the broader context of the 1967 riots, with the National Guard's role and the Algiers Motel killings serving as a microcosm of the racial tensions that erupted that year. The film's characters, such as rising R&B singer Larry Reed, private security guard Melvin Dismukes, and the white visitors caught in the wrong place, provide a glimpse into the diverse individuals affected by the events.\n\nWhile \"Detroit\" is praised for its immersive and harrowing depiction, it is criticized for its lack of nuanced character development and reliance on factual accuracy. The film's examination of the Algiers Motel incident leaves some details to be imagined by the filmmakers, reflecting the limitations of reconstructing a historical event.\n\nOverall, \"Detroit\" serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle against systemic racism and police brutality, resonating with contemporary issues.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through resource acquisition.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's theory proposes a three-step progression for civilizations seeking to dominate the universe. The first step involves utilizing a planet's resources (Type I), followed by harnessing a star's energy (Type II), and eventually capturing energy from an entire galaxy (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that civilizations must actively capture energy from distant stars to prevent being isolated due to the expanding universe's dark energy. As space expands, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible, necessitating proactive measures to secure energy sources.\n\nHooper proposes that advanced civilizations, like those possibly at the Type II or III stage, would actively collect energy from stars by constructing Dyson spheres or other mega-structures, such as solar-powered satellites (statites) forming a cloud around the star. This would ensure a continuous supply of energy for their growth and survival.\n\nOlaf Stapledon's science fiction and physicist Freeman Dyson's theories have inspired ideas about energy-harvesting structures, with Dyson spheres being a prominent example. These structures could be detected by their waste heat or unusual light signatures, with longer wavelength peaks indicating harvested stars.\n\nWhile humans are currently at a relatively early stage, the possibility of ancient, advanced civilizations operating on a grand scale is discussed. The search for these civilizations could involve observing unusual light patterns, such as Dyson spheres or accelerated stars, as signs of energy extraction and manipulation.\n\nIn summary, the news revolves around the pursuit of galactic dominance by civilizations, driven by the need for energy and the looming threat of cosmic isolation due to dark energy.

Initially, Stewart took over the show in 1999, replacing Craig Kilborn, amidst tensions with the existing staff who were resistant to his vision. Stewart's appointment was met with skepticism, but his distinct point of view, characterized by a shift from mocking conventional news to a more pointed, purposeful approach, set the show on a new trajectory.\n\nThe introduction of Jon Stewart marked a change in the show's content, with a focus on political satire and deconstructing the news process. Key hires like Ben Karlin, a fellow writer with a similar perspective, and Stephen Colbert, who brought a unique blend of humor and a straight-faced delivery, contributed to the show's growth. The early years were marked by clashes and power struggles, with Stewart asserting control and pushing for a more aggressive stance against politicians and the media.\n\nNotable moments include a controversial \"fuck-you\" meeting and a field piece by Steve Carell, which showcased the show's evolving format. The segment with John McCain during the 2000 presidential campaign, where Carell grilled him about unauthorized appropriations, was a turning point, demonstrating the potential for the show to delve into political satire beyond light-hearted jokes.\n\nAs the show gained popularity, it became a platform for Stewart to challenge the status quo and hold public figures accountable, setting it apart from traditional news formats. The Daily Show's success coincided with the rise of cable news networks and the changing media landscape, attracting a younger audience and eventually becoming a cultural force.\n\nThroughout the summary, Jon Stewart's determination to transform the show into a more pointed commentary on politics and the media is highlighted, leading to a period of growth and innovation, despite initial resistance from the staff.

The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes. Prosin, meanwhile, says her group isn't stopping with the chimps and will also target the release of other animals.

Gibson CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, maintained that the company had purchased the wood legally, but the government claimed that emails and seized documents suggested the company was aware of the potential illegality.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) director, Andrea Johnson, stated that the Lacey Act requires end-users of endangered wood, like Gibson, to verify the legality of their supply chain. According to EIA, Gibson was allegedly on the ground in Madagascar to assess the possibility of sourcing wood legally, but the agency alleged that the company knowingly imported contraband wood despite the ban on exports from Madagascar following a coup.\n\nOther guitar industry figures, such as Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Company, expressed concerns about the Lacey Act's retroactive nature, which could potentially affect guitar makers with older stock.

{"pred": "Recent studies based on observations of Mars' atmosphere reveal a fascinating glimpse into the planet's ancient past. Researchers have discovered that Mars once had a massive ancient ocean, covering nearly half of the planet's northern hemisphere, with a depth of up to a mile in some areas. This extensive body of water, estimated to hold around 20 million cubic kilometers, was present during the planet's early days, making it a potentially habitable environment. The ocean's existence supports the theory that Mars was warmer and wetter than previously believed, with water covering the surface for millions of years, possibly providing conditions conducive to life.\n\nThe water, primarily composed of standard hydrogen and deuterium, indicates significant water loss over time. The higher concentration of deuterium suggests Mars lost a substantial amount of water, with the remaining ice caps representing only a fraction of the original volume. The maps of atmospheric water and its isotopes show a pattern of water loss, with higher enrichments in deuterium in certain areas, suggesting a diverse hydrological history.\n\nThe discovery challenges earlier assumptions about Mars' water cycle and strengthens the case for the possibility of life on the planet. Mars' ancient ocean would have provided a more stable environment for life to evolve, although the search for definitive evidence of past or present life is ongoing. Future missions, such as the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, will continue to investigate the planet's potential for past or extant life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, the court ruled that the shape alone does not confer enough distinctiveness to maintain the trademark, requiring evidence of recognition in every EU country, not just a significant part. This ruling affects Nestlé's attempt to protect the Kit Kat shape, potentially removing its EU trademark status and opening the door for competitors like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj to produce similar products without fear of legal action.\n\nThe case highlights the ongoing battle between Nestlé and Mondelez, with Nestlé arguing that the shape of Kit Kat is distinctive enough to warrant trademark protection, while Mondelez disputes this claim. The outcome of the case means that the EU trademark office must reconsider its decision, potentially leading to the removal of the Kit Kat shape trademark.\n\nIn parallel, other trademark disputes have been mentioned, such as Cadbury's unsuccessful attempt to trademark a purple shade and a legal battle over the shape of gold-wrapped Easter bunnies between Lindt and Riegelein.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic roar of the T. rex, suggesting that dinosaurs, including the mighty predator, likely made sounds quite different from what popular culture portrays. According to a study published in the journal Evolution, the T. rex's vocalization might have resembled the coo of a pigeon or an ostrich's mumble, rather than the loud roars depicted in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" The study, based on the vocalizations of living birds and the possibility of closed-mouth vocalizations, proposes that dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies, might have communicated through throaty, low-frequency sounds, unlike the cinematic roars associated with dinosaurs in movies.\n\nThe research team, led by University of Texas biologist Chad Eliason, analyzed the vocalizations of various animals, including birds and crocodiles, to identify a pattern of \"closed-mouth\" vocalizations, which are common in birds with large bodies like doves and ostriches. These sounds, characterized by throaty coos or mumbles, were thought to have evolved independently multiple times in different animal lineages, including dinosaurs.\n\nWhile the iconic T. rex roar in \"Jurassic Park\" was created using a combination of animal sounds, such as baby elephant cries, tiger growls, and a goose's hiss, the real-life dinosaur sounds remain largely speculative. The study suggests that without vocal cords, dinosaurs might have produced quieter, possibly bird-like vocalizations, with the T. rex's potential sound resembling an ostrich's hoot or a coo.\n\nThe findings challenge the popular perception of dinosaur vocalizations and emphasize the gaps in our knowledge about dinosaur communication. With only limited fossil evidence, scientists can only speculate on the exact nature of dinosaur sounds, but the study provides a framework for understanding the diversity of vocal behaviors in prehistoric times. As a result, the next time you imagine a dinosaur, remember that it might have been cooing or murmuring, rather than roaring like a Hollywood creation.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

In a groundbreaking study, scientists observed subjects inside an MRI machine as they watched YouTube videos, recording the brain patterns associated with the visual cortex. By analyzing these patterns, a computer algorithm was able to create a continuous, albeit abstract, reconstruction of the videos subjects were watching, essentially 'reading' their minds. This achievement marks a leap in understanding how the brain processes dynamic visual information and could potentially pave the way for insights into dreams, thoughts, and even the decoding of internal mental imagery.\n\nThe research, led by Shinji Nishimoto and Jack Gallant, suggests that scientists are inching closer to the ability to 'see through' a person's eyes, offering a glimpse into their mental content. While the current technology can only reconstruct blurry, dream-like versions of videos, it opens up possibilities for future applications, such as understanding brain activity during dreaming and potentially even deciphering private thoughts.\n\nHowever, the technique is still in its early stages, and there are limitations. It focuses on static and dynamic visual experiences, with more complex brain areas yet to be explored. Future research aims to refine the method, improve resolution, and investigate its potential applications, including assisting individuals with paralysis by allowing them to control external devices using imagined visual experiences.\n\nWhile the technology raises ethical considerations, particularly in the realm of privacy and potential uses in criminal investigations, it primarily advances our understanding of the brain's processing capabilities and could ultimately contribute to enhancing communication and accessibility for those with disabilities.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

Bayesian statisticians, who have a history of aiding in similar searches, can help update probabilities based on factors like flight path, wind patterns, and ocean currents. The search initially focused on an area based on the plane's last known location, but as new information emerged, the probability distribution shifted. Theories about the cause of the disappearance, believed to be more likely due to a deliberate act, influenced the search priorities. Bayesian calculations involve assessing probabilities for each latitude-longitude coordinate, considering the probability of the plane being intact or damaged, and adjusting for overlapping information and conflicting data.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian analysis played a crucial role in locating the wreckage in 2009. Statisticians, using Metron Scientific Solutions' methods, accounted for factors like beacon detection probabilities, previous search areas, and the probability of the plane's survival. While Bayesian techniques were instrumental in the Air France case, experts debate their effectiveness in the ongoing Malaysia Airlines search due to the complexity of the situation and the lack of definitive information.\n\nSome statisticians argue that Bayesian methods are valuable precisely because they can adapt to changing circumstances and incorporate subjective judgment, while others express concerns about the limitations of applying statistical models when faced with limited data and conflicting theories. The search for Flight 370 has involved international collaboration, with the French government's involvement drawing on lessons learned from previous disasters, but the hunt remains challenging due to the vastness of the search area and the uncertainty surrounding the plane's fate.\n\nWithout concrete breakthroughs, the prospects for locating the plane using Bayesian techniques are considered dim.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine revealed that MRSA becomes more virulent and resistant to antibiotics when exposed to cigarette smoke. The smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it more resistant to immune defenses such as reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides. The bacteria can adhere better to human cells, facilitating their invasion. Similar findings were observed with e-cigarette smoke, although cigarette smoke had a more pronounced impact on bacterial resistance.\n\nIn another study, led by pulmonologist Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke showed enhanced survival rates and increased invasiveness in lab tests. The resistance persisted even after the smoke exposure, indicating a potential long-term impact. The research suggests that smoking not only poses health risks to smokers but also aids pathogens like MRSA in becoming more difficult to treat.

Researchers, including Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the University of Pavia, have performed a bloodstain pattern analysis on the fabric, challenging the traditional interpretation of the stains. Using live subjects and mannequins, they tested various positions and blood flow scenarios, finding inconsistencies with the patterns supposedly created by a crucifixion victim.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, highlights that the bloodstains on the shroud do not align with those expected from a crucified or hanging individual. For instance, blood trickles on the shroud indicate angles that are incompatible with the positions they should have taken if the body was in a crucifixion position. The spear wound patterns and blood flow do not match the expected flow dynamics, suggesting a standing model or artistic representation, rather than a lifelike scenario.\n\nThe investigation questions the realism of the bloodstains, particularly the spear wound and the \"blood belt\" around the waist, which cannot be replicated by either a standing or a supine body. The findings imply that the shroud may be a medieval creation, possibly a didactic representation from the 14th century, rather than a genuine relic.\n\nWhile the study does not definitively prove the shroud's inauthenticity, it adds to the ongoing debate and scientific scrutiny of the cloth.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The United Nations and other international actors are increasingly recognizing the damaging effects of institutional care, which can lead to severe emotional, physical, and cognitive harm, particularly for infants and those with special needs.\n\nLumos' work focuses on advocating for alternative care models such as family-based solutions, inclusive education, and support services for families.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

However, the tax faced criticism for its potential negative impacts. Critics argue that soda taxes don't improve public health, as they drive consumers to purchase beverages outside the city, hurting local businesses and causing revenue loss. Seattle's tax led to price hikes, with a case of Gatorade increasing by over 64% due to the tax. The tax exempted beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, prompting businesses like Costco to display price differences to inform customers about cheaper options outside the city. The tax's regressive nature united diverse groups against it, including businesses, unions, and libertarians.\n\nIn contrast, the Cook County, Illinois, soda tax was repealed within two months due to public backlash, with businesses experiencing decreased sales and customers voting with their feet. Seattle's tax prompted retailers like Costco to adjust prices and lose customers, while the city's reliance on soda tax revenue seems uncertain.\n\nSimilar debates have erupted in other cities, like Spokane, where a bill to introduce a statewide soda tax was introduced but not expected to pass this year. The Seattle tax's unintended consequences highlight the challenge of using pricing as a behavioral tool, as it can lead to counterintuitive outcomes, such as reduced revenue and potential job losses.\n\nOverall, the implementation of soda taxes has proven controversial, with critics arguing that they don't achieve their intended goals and can create more problems than they solve, especially when it comes to fairness and unintended economic consequences.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Rebekah's case highlights the issue of missing persons in Humboldt County, which has the highest per-capita rate of missing persons in California, as reported by the Attorney General's office.\n\nThe county's high rate of missing persons is not due to a surge in cold cases or serial killings, as previously speculated. Instead, it is attributed to factors such as the lenient reporting policy, a large transient population, and the high number of missing children, particularly those in foster care, due to the area's cannabis industry. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office receives numerous reports, with many cases being resolved quickly, either because the individuals were voluntarily missing or found soon after reporting.\n\nThe Humboldt County has a higher number of missing persons reports, with both adults and children, but the majority of cases are not considered cold cases. The Sheriff's Office is actively searching for missing individuals, with a dedicated team of detectives working on each case. The situation is further complicated by the possibility of false reports, as some individuals, like Rebekah Martinez, turn out to be alive and well after being listed as missing.\n\nThe Humboldt County's high rate of missing children is partly due to the transient nature of the cannabis industry workers, who may go uncontacted for extended periods. The Sheriff's Office emphasizes the importance of keeping the lines of communication open with family members and encourages them to report any changes in contact, as this helps in resolving cases more efficiently.\n\nIn conclusion, while Humboldt County's statistics on missing persons may seem alarming, the majority of cases are not unsolved mysteries but rather reflect the transient nature of the population and the challenges associated with maintaining contact in a remote area with a thriving cannabis industry.", "answers": ["It turns out missing people are pretty easy to find when they appear every week in your living room.

Based on mathematical models and analysis of the orbits of distant dwarf planets and other small objects, Brown and his colleague Konstantin Batygin argue that there is strong evidence for a massive planet, which they call \"Planet Nine,\" located at the edge of the solar system.\n\nThis unseen planet, estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth, could lie between 50 to 100 astronomical units (AU) beyond Pluto, causing the orbits of nearby objects to exhibit unusual patterns. While Brown initially believed Pluto's demotion was inevitable due to the discovery of Eris, a similarly-sized dwarf planet, he now believes the existence of a ninth planet could restore Pluto's status as a planet, as it would meet the criteria for clearing its orbital neighborhood.\n\nBrown's work, along with Batygin's, relies on indirect evidence, such as the gravitational influence on distant objects, rather than direct observation. The discovery of Planet Nine would be a significant event, potentially altering our understanding of the solar system's formation and dynamics.

This shift in demographics challenges current guidelines, which typically recommend screening at age 50.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The rock shelter, with a blackened roof indicating controlled fires, contained sophisticated tools, bone fragments from a large extinct marsupial (Diprotodon optatum), and evidence of human interaction with megafauna. This pushes back the timeline of human presence in Australia, suggesting a quicker colonization than previously believed.\n\nThe excavation uncovered 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, including the oldest known use of ochre and evidence of early technological advancements like stone axes and bone tools. The presence of megafauna remains, particularly Diprotodon bones, indicate possible hunting and coexistence with early humans.

The movie, \"Detroit,\" directed by Bigelow and co-written with Mark Boal, explores the systemic racism and police violence during the height of the riots, which left 43 dead and thousands injured. The film highlights the stark contrast between the official exoneration of the police and the lingering consequences of racial inequality.\n\nThe movie, set against the backdrop of the National Guard's enforcement of order amidst the chaos, exposes the racism and brutality of some officers, while also depicting the moral dilemma faced by others. It delves into the Algiers Motel siege, where a young black singer, Larry Reed, and his friends become caught in the crossfire. The film's focus on the characters, such as Reed, played by Algee Smith, and Melvin Dismukes, portrayed by John Boyega, reveals the harsh reality of the time, even if it lacks extensive character development.\n\nThe film's portrayal of the police force is nuanced, with some officers shown as horrified by the violence they encounter.

{"pred": "This news summary highlights the intriguing prospects of advanced civilizations expanding and dominating the universe, as outlined by various scientific theories and recent research. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev's three-step plan for galactic expansion proposes civilizations progress through three stages: Type I (planet-bound), Type II (star-bound), and Type III (galaxy-bound). The recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, revisits Kardashev's model, emphasizing the importance of energy harvesting for long-term survival and resource acquisition.\n\nAs civilizations advance, they face the challenge of dark energy's accelerating expansion, which threatens to isolate them from distant star systems. To counter this, Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations would actively capture stars, forming Dyson spheres or other structures like solar-powered satellites (statites) to harness their energy. This would involve capturing stars with sufficient mass (around 20-100 times the sun's mass) to ensure a sustainable energy source.\n\nOlaf Stapledon's science fiction and physicist Freeman Dyson's work inspired by Stapledon's \"Star Maker\" envision massive energy-trapping structures, such as Dyson spheres or statites, as signatures of highly evolved civilizations. These megastructures would be stable, possibly using solar sails to maintain equilibrium around their host star without disrupting orbits.\n\nWhile humans are currently at a relatively early stage (Type I), advanced civilizations could have already reached Type II or III, harvesting energy from entire stars. The search for such civilizations involves monitoring for unusual light signatures, like galaxies with missing stars or those showing signs of star acceleration due to energy extraction.\n\nIn conclusion, the quest for universal dominance involves not just resource acquisition but also a race against time, as civilizations strive to secure energy from distant stars before the expanding universe isolates them. As scientists and science fiction continue to ponder these concepts, the search for extraterrestrial life may reveal clues to the existence of ancient, resourceful civilizations expanding and adapting to the challenges of the cosmos.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "A series of recent discoveries in East Africa challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors. Researchers, as reported in three papers published in Science, suggest that dramatic climate shifts during the Middle Stone Age, around 320,000 years ago, may have driven significant advancements in toolmaking and social interactions among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. The excavated tools, including sharp obsidian spearpoints and Middle Stone Age tools, indicate a shift from simple, regional stone tools to more specialized instruments crafted from faraway resources like obsidian.\n\nThese innovations, such as the use of obsidian and the development of standardized Middle Stone Age tools, suggest increased mobility, trade, and information sharing among hominid populations. The Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, with its alternating wet and dry climate conditions, provides a crucial context for these changes. While it's uncertain if Homo sapiens were the primary creators of these tools, the evidence points to a growing reliance on long-distance resources and social networks.\n\nThe findings align with the idea that climate fluctuations played a significant role in shaping human behavior, as seen in the downsizing of earlier tools and the adoption of more specialized tools like hand axes and obsidian-based spearpoints. The discovery of red pigment and the earliest evidence of pigment use also hints at symbolic communication and social organization.\n\nThe research challenges the traditional view of a single \"human revolution\" around 40,000-50,000 years ago, proposing that the development of modern behaviors might have started much earlier, possibly in response to environmental pressures. However, the relationship between these technological advancements and the rise of Homo sapiens remains complex, with evidence from different parts of Africa showing a mix of behaviors across various hominin species.\n\nOverall, these discoveries shed light on the gradual development of complex human cognition and social structures, highlighting the importance of adaptation and cooperation in response to environmental changes, potentially setting the stage for the emergence of modern human traits well before the commonly acknowledged timeline.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

United is now using two lanes, with one lane dedicated for top-tier passengers (Premier 1K and Global Services, as well as military personnel and passengers with special privileges) and another for groups 1 to 5, with groups 3, 4, and 5 boarding after the initial priority groups.

The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes. Prosin, meanwhile, says her group isn't stopping with the chimps and will also target the release of other animals.

The raid was part of an enforcement of the Lacey Act, a law that extends protection to endangered plants, including the ban on imports of certain hardwoods like ebony due to concerns over illegal harvesting. Gibson, led by CEO Henry Juszkiewicz, maintains its innocence, stating that it believed it was sourcing legally, despite the government's claims that emails and seized documents suggested the company knew about potential illegal practices. The Environmental Investigation Agency's Andrea Johnson argues that the law requires companies like Gibson to verify the legality of their supply chain, and EIA's investigations have reportedly linked Gibson to knowingly using wood from illegal sources.\n\nThe situation has raised concerns among other guitar manufacturers, such as C.F. Martin & Co., who faced similar issues with Madagascar wood after a coup led to questions about the legality of their supply chain. The Lacey Act, amended in 2008, applies retroactively to the trade in endangered wood, potentially affecting the industry's practices and the documentation required for wood sourcing.\n\nAttorneys, like Ronald Bienstock, criticize the law's retroactivity and the potential for it to cause uncertainty for those with old guitars, as the government could ask for proof of the legality of wood sourced years ago.

{"pred": "Recent research findings shed new light on the water history of Mars, revealing a previously unseen level of water coverage on the planet. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a significant portion of the Martian northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, up to a mile deep in some areas, existed during the planet's early days, providing a warm and wet environment. The ocean persisted for millions of years, with water covering about half of Mars' surface, potentially supporting the possibility of life.\n\nThe study, conducted by NASA scientists using infrared telescopes, discovered that Mars had lost a vast amount of water due to its thinning atmosphere, leaving behind a deuterium-enriched ice layer. The maps of atmospheric water and its deuterium form indicate a D/H enrichment, suggesting substantial water loss. The depleted water reservoirs imply a global equivalent water layer of at least 137 meters deep, with the highest enrichment in some regions, reaching up to 8 times the Earth's ocean ratio.\n\nThis discovery challenges previous beliefs about the sporadic presence of water on Mars, indicating a more prolonged and widespread wet period. Mars' ancient climate supported the formation of rivers, deltas, and possibly even lakes, making it a more favorable environment for life. However, while the conditions were conducive to habitability, the exact extent of past life remains uncertain.\n\nThe search for life on Mars continues, with upcoming missions like the Exomars rover set to explore further.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

This decision annuls Nestlé's appeal and sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) for reconsideration.\n\nThe Kit Kat shape has been a subject of legal battles for years, with Mondelez arguing that the shape is not distinctive enough to warrant trademark protection.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic roar of the T. rex, suggesting that dinosaurs likely didn't sound like the fierce beasts portrayed in popular culture. A study published in the journal Evolution reveals that the T. rex's vocalizations might have resembled those of birds, particularly large-bodied dinosaurs like ostriches or doves, emitting low-frequency, throaty sounds similar to cooing or muffled grunts. The study, based on analysis of living and extinct animals, including birds and crocodiles, found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are common in birds with large bodies, could have evolved independently multiple times in ancient reptiles.\n\nThe sounds in the 1993 film \"Jurassic Park\" were created using a variety of animal sounds. For instance, the T. rex's roar was a composite of baby elephant cries, tiger growls, and an alligator's gurgle, while the raptors' sounds were influenced by goose vocalizations, with the velociraptors' hiss resembling a goose's. The team behind the film, such as sound designer Gary Rydstrom, mixed real-life animal recordings to craft the fictional dinos' calls, with some surprising sources like mating tortoises for the raptors and a baby elephant for the T. rex.\n\nThe study highlights the lack of knowledge about dinosaur vocalizations due to the scarcity of fossil evidence for vocal organs. While it's suggested that dinosaurs might have had air sacs similar to birds, enabling them to produce bird-like coos or throaty murmurs, the exact nature of their calls remains speculative. The findings challenge the traditional notion of dinosaurs roaring like King Kong, pointing towards a more subtle and possibly bird-like repertoire.\n\nThe research underscores the complexity of dinosaur vocalizations and the potential for diverse sounds, even if dinosaurs didn't have vocal cords like mammals. With the discovery of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and the possibility of their evolutionary origins, scientists are revising our understanding of dinosaur communication, leaving room for future discoveries in the realm of dinosaur vocalizations.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

{"pred": "The news passages discuss the application of Bayesian statistics in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014. Bayesian statisticians play a crucial role in refining search efforts by updating probabilities based on available data. These statisticians, like those who worked on the Air France Flight 447 case, use a systematic approach to analyze factors such as flight path, wind patterns, ocean currents, and previous search areas to create a probability distribution. Bayesian methods help in assessing the likelihood of the plane being in a specific location, considering the probability of accidents, deliberate acts, and the probability of the plane being intact or damaged.\n\nThe search for Flight 370 has involved complex calculations, with experts estimating the probability of the plane's location, taking into account new information that suggests a deliberate diversion. Bayesian calculations have been compared to the challenge of deciding on a restaurant or college basketball team's championship chances, updating probabilities as new information emerges. However, the search for Flight 370 is complicated by the uncertainty of the cause of disappearance, with the probability distribution shifting as new evidence suggests a deliberate act.\n\nThe hunt for Air France Flight 447 serves as a precedent, where Bayesian techniques, initially employed by Metron Scientific Solutions, helped locate the wreckage after multiple searches. The process involves quantifying subjective judgment and accounting for factors like beacon detection rates, damage probability, and the overlap of different variables.\n\nWhile Bayesian methods are seen as valuable in refining search strategies, critics like statistician Bradley Efron argue that they may not be suitable for drastic changes in circumstances, as in the case of Flight 370, where the initial search area might need to be adjusted significantly. The search for the Malaysia Airlines flight remains ongoing, with statisticians grappling with the challenge of balancing quantitative analysis with the limitations of available data and the need to adapt to new information.\n\nThe search for Flight 370 highlights the importance of record-keeping and the need for flexibility in Bayesian calculations. While statisticians like Colleen Keller emphasize the need to update models as new information comes in, others, like Tony O'Hagan, advocate for Bayesian techniques in adapting to changing circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayesian statistics are proving instrumental in refining the search for missing aircraft, but the application of these methods to the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 case is complicated by the evolving nature of the investigation and the need to balance statistical rigor with the uncertainty of the situation.

{"pred": "On Wednesday evening, an unusual incident occurred in Mendon when a driver, Nabila Altahan, followed her GPS directions too hastily. While driving a Toyota Corolla on Route 4, Altahan, attempting to correct for a missed destination, overreacted to a GPS instruction. The car veered off the road and became suspended from a telephone pole after she turned around abruptly. The Corolla, with Altahan and her passenger unharmed, was lifted up the wire support after the GPS directed her to make an unexpected U-turn. A witness observed Altahan exit the vehicle as it dangled from the pole. Local authorities, including State Police and the Rutland City Fire Department, responded to the scene, resolving the situation without further injury. This amusing yet cautionary tale highlights the potential risks of overly relying on GPS technology.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP. Police say 30-year-old Nabila Altahan of Dorchester, Mass., was headed west on US Route 4 when she passed her intended destination and reacted quickly to the instructions, leaving the road at a significant enough speed to propel the vehicle up the wires.

The investigation, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found that they are inconsistent with the idea that the shroud is a genuine relic of the crucifixion.\n\nThe researchers, led by forensic scientist Matteo Borrini and organic chemist Luigi Garlaschelli, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to study the bloodstains on the cloth. They found that the bloodstains on the cloth are not consistent with the idea that the shroud is a death shroud of a person who was crucified or hung on a cross. Instead, the bloodstains suggest that the cloth was used to create an artistic or didactic representation of the crucifixion, rather than an actual relic of the event.\n\nThe researchers found that the bloodstains on the cloth are inconsistent with each other, and do not match the expected patterns of blood flow that would occur if the cloth was used to wrap the body of a person who was crucified.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The site, which is part of the Marden Henge complex, is thought to have been used for status and power displays, showcasing the wealth and ability to mobilize a massive workforce.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wilsford Henge, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton of a child has been unearthed. The skeleton, which is about 1.5m in length, was found lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace. Scientific analysis will provide information on the child's gender, diet, pathologies, and date of burial, which may shed light on where the child lived.\n\nThe discoveries are part of a three-year dig in the Vale of Pewsey, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary.

The melanosomes, or pigment sacs, in the feathers are organized into sheets and are similar to those found in hummingbirds, suggesting that Caihong may have had a rainbow-like sheen. The discovery is significant because it is the oldest known example of iridescent feathers in a dinosaur, and it provides evidence that this type of coloration evolved in small raptor dinosaurs before the origin of birds.\n\nThe fossil was found in 2014 by a local farmer in Hebei Province, China, and was acquired by the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

Since then, research has shown that prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a range of effects, including physical, behavioral, and cognitive problems.\n\n**Symptoms of FASD**\n\nThe symptoms of FASD can vary widely, but may include physical characteristics such as a small head size, short stature, and facial abnormalities. Behavioral symptoms may include hyperactivity, impulsivity, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Cognitive symptoms may include intellectual disability, memory problems, and difficulty with problem-solving.\n\n**Prevention and Treatment**\n\nThe best way to prevent FASD is for women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy. If a woman is already pregnant and has been drinking, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.

The study found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar disorders. The researchers analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers, and found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy had a higher risk of having a child with ADHD.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development. However, the study did not find a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD, and the authors emphasized that the results do not mean that pregnant women should never take acetaminophen. Instead, they recommend that women avoid taking the drug frequently and consider alternative methods for pain relief, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has linked acetaminophen use during pregnancy to an increased risk of behavioral problems in children. However, other experts have pointed out that the study's results are not definitive and that more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.\n\nThe manufacturer of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, has issued a statement saying that the company is aware of the study's findings, but that there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.

The House of Representatives has passed a bill to fund federal agencies through December 15, but the bill includes conditions related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which Senate Democrats are likely to reject. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a harder stance on the ACA, while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is refusing to budge on the issue.\n\nThe standoff has significant implications for the Washington D.C. region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors. According to a local economist, a shutdown could cost the region $200 million a day and affect over 700,000 jobs. The shutdown could also impact tourism, with popular attractions like the Smithsonian museums and National Zoo potentially closing.\n\nThe potential shutdown has widespread ripple effects, including delays in federal benefits, mail delivery, and court proceedings. Local governments are bracing for the impact, with some setting aside funds to mitigate the effects of a shutdown. The shutdown could also have a disproportionate impact on the region's economy, which is already weak.\n\nAs the deadline approaches, lawmakers are scrambling to find a solution. The White House and Senate Democrats are refusing to accept the House bill, while House Republicans are pushing for a vote on a clean continuing resolution. The outcome is uncertain, but one thing is clear: a shutdown would have significant consequences for the nation's capital and the country as a whole.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission is named after astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. The spacecraft will be launched in the summer of 2018 and will take seven years to complete its mission.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will travel to within 4 million miles of the sun's surface, closer than any other spacecraft has ever been. It will have to withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit and will be protected by a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield. The spacecraft will also have a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to keep it at a safe temperature.\n\nThe mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring the mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The findings from the mission will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will make 24 close flybys of the sun, with its closest approach being within 9 solar radii of the sun's surface. The spacecraft will also carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate with an inscription of his choice.\n\nThe mission is a testament to Parker's groundbreaking work and will provide new insights into the sun and its behavior.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

However, she noted that doctors should be on the lookout for warning signs of colon cancer and that people with a family history of the disease should begin screening earlier.\n\nOther experts, such as Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, have expressed caution about expanding screening to younger age groups, citing the low risk of colon cancer in this population.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

The Warratyi rock-shelter, located about 550 kilometers north of Adelaide, contains a treasure trove of artefacts, including burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, and the earliest known use of ochre in Australia. The site also provides evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and a large, extinct flightless bird.\n\nThe discovery pushes back the known dates of human settlement in the region by around 10,000 years, and suggests that humans were able to adapt to the harsh arid environment much earlier than previously thought. The site also challenges the assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world, as the artefacts found at Warratyi show a high level of technological sophistication.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of archaeologists led by Giles Hamm from La Trobe University, who used a combination of radiocarbon dating and optical dating to determine the age of the artefacts. The team found that the quartz grains from the site date back to around 44,000 years ago, while the radiocarbon dating of the burnt eggshells suggests that they are between 45,000 and 49,000 years old.\n\nThe find is significant not only for its age, but also for its implications for our understanding of the history of human settlement in Australia. It suggests that humans were able to expand out of the coastal regions and into the interior of the country much more quickly than previously thought, and that they were able to adapt to the harsh conditions of the arid environment.\n\nThe discovery is also significant for its implications for the debate over the extinction of megafauna in Australia. The presence of Diprotodon and other megafauna remains at the site suggests that humans were living alongside these animals, and may have played a role in their extinction. The find is a major milestone in the study of Australian prehistory, and is likely to be the subject of ongoing research and debate in the years to come.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "A recent paper published on arXiv.org has revived the concept of a Russian astronomer's proposal for a three-step plan to dominate the universe, which involves harvesting energy from stars. According to the paper's author, Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, harvesting energy from distant stars is not only a way to increase a civilization's resources but also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving a civilization alone in the vastness of space.\n\nThe paper suggests that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies, reel them in, and harvest their energy before they become inaccessible forever. This would be done by using a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" to hover around a star and beam energy back to a nearby planet.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960 and has since been featured in science fiction works such as Olaf Stapledon's novel \"Star Maker\" and Larry Niven's novel \"Ringworld.\" Dyson spheres are thought to be a way for advanced civilizations to harness the energy of their star and could potentially be detectable as a sign of intelligent life.\n\nThe paper also suggests that advanced civilizations would likely be picky about the stars they harvest, only targeting stars with a mass of 20 to 100 times that of the sun, which would be viable candidates for capturing and hauling back to their home galaxy. The spectrum of starlight from a galaxy that has had its useful stars harvested would be dominated by massive stars and would peak at longer wavelengths than otherwise would have been the case.\n\nWhile humans are still at Level I of Kardashev's scale, which involves harnessing all the resources of a planet, advanced civilizations could be thousands or even millions of years older and already be well into their Level III, star-harvesting phase. The paper concludes that if another civilization has indeed begun rearranging the stars, it may not be long before Earthlings notice them, and astronomers could potentially detect the unusual galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away from them.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show. Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them.\" Head writer Ben Karlin: \"I remember seeing it in the editing room. I remember Jon called me down, and seeing it and thinking, Yeah, this is what we should be doing. This is the goal. It was one of Carell’s most incredible moments. He asks McCain a question in a way that no journalists were talking to the candidates. And it was like, Oh s---, we are able, in this weird, unintentional way, to add a level of insight to the process that doesn’t exist. That was really, really exciting.\" Click for the full piece, in which Stewart talks about how that 2000 campaign provided his \"aha moment\" of how to present the show—by \"deconstructing the process.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 7229}

{"pred": "Scientists have made groundbreaking discoveries in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin, uncovering evidence of ancient human innovation and technological advancements dating back 320,000 years. The findings, published in three new studies, suggest that early humans in Africa were more advanced than previously thought, with a sophisticated understanding of technology, social networks, and symbolic expression.\n\nThe research reveals that the earliest evidence of Middle Stone Age tools, characterized by smaller, more specialized stone tools, emerged around 320,000 years ago. These tools were made from obsidian, a volcanic glass, which was transported from distant locations, indicating long-distance trade and exchange networks. The discovery of brightly colored red and black rocks, which were drilled into to extract pigment, suggests a complex culture with symbolic expression.\n\nThe findings challenge the traditional view of human evolution, which posits that modern human behaviors, such as symbolism and innovation, emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that these behaviors were present much earlier, around 300,000 years ago, and were driven by environmental pressures, such as climate change and the need to adapt to a changing landscape.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of social networks and exchange in early human societies, with evidence of long-distance trade and the sharing of knowledge and skills. The discovery of obsidian and pigment suggests that early humans were able to maintain relationships with distant groups, which was crucial for their survival during times of stress.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the emergence of modern human behavior. They suggest that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern may not have been a sudden event, but rather a gradual process that occurred over thousands of years. The research also highlights the importance of considering the African continent as a whole, rather than just focusing on Europe and Asia, in understanding the evolution of human behavior.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year.

The raid was related to the Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law that was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, despite the country's ban on exports of ebony and rosewood. Gibson denies these allegations, claiming that all of its purchases from Madagascar complied with US and Malagasy law.\n\nThe Lacey Act has been criticized for being burdensome, with some guitar builders worried about being forced to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago. The law is also retroactive, which has raised concerns about the impact on the guitar industry. The government has tried to create exemptions for vintage instruments, but these have been delayed and have caused uncertainty for dealers and collectors.\n\nThe EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the Lacey Act, saying that it is intended to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that responsible sourcing of wood is necessary. The government has not commented on the case, but a court motion filed in June asserts that Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband. Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, has expressed frustration that the company has been implicated in wrongdoing without being charged, and that the government has not provided clear guidance on how to comply with the law.\n\nIn related news, Alexa Internet has been donating its crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996, which is used to create the Wayback Machine.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \"It's a nightmare,\" says a dealer. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 1352}

In a split second, Borch decided to use her bare hands to defend herself, holding the raccoon underwater in a puddle until it stopped struggling.

{"pred": "NASA scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the history of Mars, revealing that a massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the planet's northern hemisphere. The ocean, which was at least a mile deep in some areas, was a significant portion of the planet's surface, equivalent to the Atlantic Ocean covering the Earth. This finding challenges previous theories that Mars was a dry and barren planet, and instead suggests that it was once a warm and wet world with a habitable environment.\n\nThe discovery was made by analyzing the Martian atmosphere and the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water vapor. The team found that the Martian atmosphere has a higher proportion of deuterium than Earth's, indicating that the planet has lost a significant amount of water over time. By calculating the rate at which the ordinary hydrogen has been leaking into space, the scientists were able to estimate the amount of water that once existed on Mars.\n\nThe results suggest that the ancient ocean would have covered the entire planet to a depth of about 137 meters, but it's likely that it would have formed an ocean in the northern hemisphere, which has a lower altitude. The discovery has significant implications for the search for life on Mars, as it suggests that the planet may have been habitable for a longer period than previously thought.\n\nThe study also found that the early Martian atmosphere was rich in heavy hydrogen, which would have escaped along with the ordinary variety, skewing any calculations based on today's values. This means that the true amount of water that once existed on Mars may have been even larger than estimated.\n\nThe discovery is a major breakthrough in our understanding of Mars' history and has significant implications for the search for life on the Red Planet. The European Space Agency's Exomars rover, set to launch in 2018, will search for chemical signatures of life on Mars, and the discovery of an ancient ocean on the planet increases the chances of finding evidence of life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The court ruled that Nestlé had failed to prove that the shape was distinctive enough to be recognized as a trademark across all EU countries. This means that the EU's trademark office must review its decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark, and it is possible that the trademark could be cancelled.\n\nThe case has been ongoing for over a decade, with Nestlé applying for a trademark in 2002 and the EU trademark office granting it in 2006. However, rival company Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, had objected to the trademark and the case has been the subject of numerous appeals and court battles.\n\nThe ruling has implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. It also has been followed closely by trademark lawyers, who see implications for the protection of intellectual property rights.\n\nThe case has also been mirrored by a dispute between the two multinationals in the British courts, where Nestle objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.\n\nIn related news, the EU's trademark office has also been considering a trademark application for the shape of Toblerone, a Swiss chocolate bar owned by Mondelez.

The company had also argued that the EU trademark office had been wrong to grant Nestlé's trademark in the first place.\n\nThe case is not yet over, as Nestlé has said that it will continue to fight for its trademark and may appeal the decision to the EU's highest court.

The research, published in the journal Evolution, found that many birds make sounds with their closed mouths, which are often quieter and lower in pitch than sounds made with an open beak. The study's authors analyzed the distribution of this vocal ability among birds and other reptilian groups and found that it has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs, and may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays. They also found that only animals with a relatively large body size, such as doves and ostriches, use closed-mouth vocalization behavior.\n\nThe study's authors used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups, and found that it is more common in large-bodied birds and less common in small-bodied birds. They also found that the association with large bodies is a matter of physics, as the inflation of an elastic cavity requires a certain amount of lung pressure, which is more challenging for smaller animals.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of what dinosaurs sounded like. While we may not know exactly what they sounded like, the study suggests that they may have made sounds similar to those of birds, such as cooing or booming sounds. The study's authors plan to continue their research by integrating information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to understand the sounds that extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors produced.\n\nIn related news, a sound designer who worked on the movie Jurassic Park revealed that he used a variety of animal sounds to create the dinosaurs' vocalizations, including tortoises, horses, and even a baby owl.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one.

{"pred": "Egypt is holding its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its gains and potentially win a majority of the seats. The party has already won a significant number of seats in the first two rounds of voting, and is expected to do well in the nine provinces voting in the final round. The Brotherhood has played down its electoral strength, but some analysts believe it could win more than half of the seats.\n\nMeanwhile, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak has resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing Mubarak of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensuring his son Gamal would succeed him. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the uprising that forced him from office, and could face the death penalty if convicted.\n\nThe election and Mubarak's trial come amid growing opposition to the ruling military council, which has been criticized for its handling of the transition to democracy. The council has said it will not cede power until presidential elections are held by the end of June, but protesters are demanding an earlier transfer of power.\n\nThe economy is also a major concern, with growth slowing due to the unrest and foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% in the first 11 months of 2011. The benchmark EGX 30 stock index lost 49% last year, making it the third-worst performer among world markets.\n\nThe new parliament is expected to be formed on January 23, but it is unclear what powers it will have and how a new government will be formed. The Brotherhood has said it intends to form a coalition or unity government, but winning a clear majority would enable it to govern without forming a coalition.\n\nThe ultraconservative Salafis, who have won around 25% of the seats in the first two rounds of voting, are also expected to play a significant role in the new parliament. The Brotherhood has sought to ally itself with liberal parties, but the Salafis have been critical of the Brotherhood's moderate approach.\n\nThe trial of Mubarak's sons, Alaa and Gamal, is also ongoing, with the two facing corruption charges. The trial has been marked by procedural delays and controversy, with lawyers for the victims demanding that the presiding judge be removed.\n\nOverall, the election and trial are significant milestones in Egypt's transition to democracy, but the country still faces many challenges, including economic instability and political uncertainty.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

Nabila Altahan, the driver of a Toyota Corolla, was heading westbound on Route 4 when her GPS device suddenly instructed her to turn around, as she had passed her intended destination. Altahan reacted quickly to the directions, leaving the road and causing the car to become suspended on the guy wire of a telephone pole across from Sugar & Spice Restaurant.

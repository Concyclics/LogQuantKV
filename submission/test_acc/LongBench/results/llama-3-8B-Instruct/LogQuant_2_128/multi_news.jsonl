According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, cigarette smoke fuels the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses. The study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, found that cigarette smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species. This means that MRSA becomes more difficult to kill, allowing it to thrive and cause more harm to the body.\n\nThe study also found that cigarette smoke makes MRSA more resistant to the immune system's antimicrobial defenses, allowing it to better adhere to human cells and invade them more easily. This increased virulence could lead to more severe infections and a higher mortality rate in mice.\n\nThe researchers suggest that cigarette smoke may be an additional contributing factor to the increasing resistance of MRSA to antimicrobial treatments.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The bill has been met with opposition from retailers and consumers, who argue that the tax will drive business out of the state and harm local economies.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

In the United States, the right to habeas corpus was enshrined in the Constitution, but recent legislation has eroded this fundamental right. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 revoked the right to habeas corpus for those detained at Guantanamo Bay, allowing the government to hold individuals indefinitely without cause.\n\nIn a related development, a New York judge has granted a writ of habeas corpus to two research chimps, Hercules and Leo, allowing them to challenge their detention at Stony Brook University.

The ocean, which was at least 137 meters deep, was present on Mars around 4.5 billion years ago, when the planet was still in its early stages of formation. The discovery was made by analyzing the composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which showed a significant enrichment of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThe research team, led by NASA's Geronimo Villanueva, used data from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope to study the atmospheric water vapor on Mars. They found that the water vapor was enriched with deuterium, indicating that the planet had lost a significant amount of water over time.\n\nThe team's findings suggest that the ancient ocean on Mars was at least 137 meters deep and covered about 20% of the planet's surface. The discovery has significant implications for the search for life on Mars, as it suggests that the planet was once warm and wet, with conditions that could have supported life.\n\nThe research also provides new insights into the planet's history, suggesting that Mars was once a more Earth-like planet with a thicker atmosphere and a more stable climate.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The report, published in the Lancet medical journal, analyzed data from 188 countries and found that obesity is not limited to developed countries, but is a problem in both rich and poor nations.\n\nAccording to the report, the number of overweight or obese individuals has increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013, with the highest rates found in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Pacific. The report also found that obesity is not limited to adults, but is also affecting children and adolescents, with rates increasing by 47% in the past 33 years.\n\nThe report highlights the complexity of the problem, citing factors such as increased availability of junk food, sedentary lifestyles, and changes in the mix of bacteria in the human gut as contributing to the rise in obesity. The report also notes that obesity is not limited to developed countries, with developing countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and China also experiencing high rates of obesity.\n\nThe report's findings are concerning, as obesity is a major risk factor for a range of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study the issue and find solutions.\n\nThe report also highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing the problem, including changes in food availability, increased physical activity, and education and awareness campaigns.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

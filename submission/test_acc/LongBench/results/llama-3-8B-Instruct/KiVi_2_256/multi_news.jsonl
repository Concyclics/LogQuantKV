Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

The discovery was made by analyzing the orbits of other objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system that contains many small, icy bodies.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked excitement among astronomers, who believe that it could be a major breakthrough in the field of astronomy. The planet is thought to be a gas giant, similar to Jupiter, and is believed to be the ninth planet in our solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine was made possible by the analysis of the orbits of other objects in the Kuiper Belt. The researchers used mathematical models to predict the existence of the planet and then used observations of the orbits of other objects to confirm its existence.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has significant implications for our understanding of the solar system. It suggests that there may be many more planets in the solar system than we previously thought, and that the solar system is much more complex than we previously believed.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also raised questions about the definition of a planet. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has defined a planet as a celestial body that orbits the sun and has enough mass to be rounded by its own gravity. However, the discovery of Planet Nine has raised questions about whether this definition is still relevant.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked a debate about the status of Pluto, which was previously considered to be the ninth planet in our solar system. Pluto is now considered to be a dwarf planet, and its status as a planet has been disputed.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also raised questions about the possibility of other planets in the solar system. The Kuiper Belt is a region of the solar system that contains many small, icy bodies, and it is possible that there are other planets in this region that have not yet been discovered.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also raised questions about the possibility of life beyond our solar system. The discovery of a planet that is similar to Jupiter, but is located at a much greater distance from the sun, suggests that there may be other planets in the universe that are similar to our own planet.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of Planet Nine is a significant breakthrough in the field of astronomy and has implications for our understanding", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd. While the dwarf planet tries to fight its way back into the good graces of Those Who Deem What Counts as a Planet, another icy orb even further out may snatch that designation first. Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology say a giant celestial body \"lurking at the end of our solar system,\" as the Washington Post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \"Planet Nine.\" In their research published in the Astronomical Journal, the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in getting Pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as Earth, and per the AP, almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says. Not everyone's convinced. \"I have seen many, many such claims in my career,\" a planetary scientist at Colorado's Southwest Research Institute tells Nature. \"And all of them have been wrong.\" (The Washington Post caught up with Brown for a Q&A on the latest Pluto-killing endeavor.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4933}

The results show that younger patients are more likely to have advanced-stage cancer and are more likely to undergo surgery and radiation therapy.

According to a paper published on the arXiv.org website, the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and the stars in distant galaxies are becoming inaccessible to us. This means that any advanced civilization that wants to harness the energy of those stars will have to capture them first.\n\nThe concept of capturing stars is not new, and was first proposed by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in the 1960s. He suggested that a civilization could harness the energy of a star by building a shell of satellites around it. This shell would be made up of millions of solar-powered satellites that would collect energy from the star and beam it back to the home planet.\n\nRecently, a new study has revived this idea and added a twist.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

The study, published in the journal Science, analyzed maps of atmospheric water and its deuterated form, revealing a significant loss of water over time. The research suggests that the ocean was at least 137 meters deep and covered a fifth of the planet's surface. The findings also indicate that the water on Mars was enriched with deuterium, a heavier form of hydrogen, which is a sign of significant water loss.\n\nThe study's lead author, Geronimo Villanueva, said that the discovery of the ancient ocean opens up the possibility of habitability on Mars, as it would have provided a stable environment for life to thrive. The research also suggests that the ocean was not a one-time event, but rather a long-standing feature of the Martian environment.\n\nThe study's findings are supported by other research, including a 2014 study that found that the ancient Martian ocean was at least 137 meters deep.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The company had argued that the shape was distinctive and had become synonymous with the Kit Kat brand, but the court found that it had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this claim.\n\nThe ruling means that other companies can now produce their own versions of the Kit Kat shape, which could lead to a proliferation of copycat products on the market. However, it's worth noting that the ruling only applies to the EU, and the trademark still exists in some countries, including Germany, France, and Italy.\n\nThe case has implications for the snack food industry, as it sets a precedent for the protection of trademarks across the EU. It also highlights the challenges of protecting intellectual property rights in a single market, where different countries have different laws and regulations.\n\nIn related news, the UK's High Court has also ruled that the purple color used by Cadbury, another chocolate company, is not a trademark. The ruling means that other companies can use the same color without infringing on Cadbury's rights.\n\nThe Kit Kat case is not the only one of its kind. Other companies have also fought over the shape of their products, including the shape of the Toblerone chocolate bar, which is owned by the Swiss company, Toblerone.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters. The brand name itself of \"KitKat\" is not being contested. (Atari accused Nestle of ripping off one of its popular video games in an ad for KitKat.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1828}
{"pred": "A new study suggests that some dinosaurs may have mumbled or cooed instead of roaring like the T. rex in Jurassic Park. Researchers found that birds, including large-bodied birds like ostriches and cassowaries, make low-pitched, throaty sounds when they vocalize with their mouths closed. This type of vocalization, known as \"closed-mouth vocalization,\" is thought to have evolved in birds to produce low-frequency sounds, often used for mating or territorial displays. The study suggests that this type of vocalization may have also been present in some dinosaurs, particularly large-bodied ones, as it is a common trait among archosaurs, a group that includes birds and crocodiles. The researchers analyzed the vocalizations of over 200 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization. They also found that this trait is more common in large-bodied birds, which may have been the case for some dinosaurs as well.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

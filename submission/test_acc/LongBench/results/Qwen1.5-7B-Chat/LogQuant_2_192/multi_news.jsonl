Former cheerleader Krystal C., who filed the initial class-action lawsuit in 2014, alleged that the cheerleaders were underpaid and not compensated for practice time. The settlement, announced in 2015, has been praised by State Sen.

The Jets' settlement sets a precedent for other teams, with the Bills already making progress in their own wage dispute.\n\nIn related cases, the Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Oakland Raiders have also faced lawsuits and have settled with their cheerleaders, with amounts ranging from $825,000 to $1.25 million.

Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) affects children and young adults, with the average age being 7, and has been linked to a strain of enterovirus, particularly EV-D68, which was also present in the 2014 outbreak. The exact cause of AFM is unknown, but it is believed to be linked to viral infections like EV-D68 and other enteroviruses. The condition presents with symptoms such as limb weakness, facial drooping, and difficulty breathing, and there is currently no specific cure, with treatment focusing on supportive care and rehabilitation.\n\nIn 2014, a spike in cases coincided with an outbreak of enterovirus D68, but the CDC has not detected EV-D68 in recent AFM cases. The best prevention methods include hand hygiene, avoiding contact with sick individuals, and staying up to date with vaccinations. Parents and healthcare providers are advised to report suspected cases to the CDC, and the agency is urging continued surveillance and research to identify the cause and potential treatments.\n\nChildren affected by AFM often require hospitalization and may experience long-term disabilities, with some cases showing partial recovery. The severity of the condition varies, with some patients needing ventilator support and others making little progress. The rise in cases has raised concerns among health officials, who are monitoring the situation closely and communicating with doctors to ensure timely reporting of cases.\n\nThe CDC has issued guidelines for preventing AFM, including washing hands regularly and avoiding contact with infected individuals.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found them to be inconsistent with a body lying flat, suggesting the blood could not have been transferred in the way described in the traditional account. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions and angles, comparing the blood flow on the shroud to those in realistic scenarios.\n\nThe researchers found that the bloodstains on the shroud do not match the expected patterns for a person standing upright, with some spots appearing only in positions where a person would stand with their arm at a 45-degree angle, rather than the 90-degree angle typically associated with a vertical cross. The analysis also revealed that the \"lumbar stain,\" which is supposed to represent blood from the back, was not replicated in the study.\n\nThe study's findings challenge the commonly held belief that the shroud's image was transferred during the three days after Jesus's death, as the blood flow patterns are incompatible with the supposed positions of the wounds. The researchers concluded that the bloodstains are more consistent with a model standing upright, rather than a person hanging on a cross or lying on the ground.\n\nWhile the Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, this investigation raises doubts about its authenticity and calls for further scientific examination. The researchers' work, though not definitive, highlights the need for a clearer understanding of the techniques used to create the image on the cloth and the possibility that it may be a medieval representation rather than a direct relic from the crucifixion.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The founder, inspired by a photograph that triggered her to action, wrote letters to influential individuals, leading to the establishment of Lumos and its mission to combat this issue.\n\nLumos' CEO, Georgette Mulheir, shares the harrowing reality of these institutions, describing them as \"nightmarish\" conditions with inadequate care and support. The charity's work is based on empirical evidence, highlighting the negative impacts of institutionalization on children's education, health, and psychological well-being. They estimate that eradicating institutionalization globally is achievable by 2050 through investments in education, healthcare, and fostering alternatives.\n\nThe article also emphasizes the importance of raising awareness, as demonstrated by the #Letstalklumos campaign launched by Rowling. Lumos, with its successes in countries like Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, has shown that reducing the number of children in institutions is not only morally right but also economically beneficial. By supporting families and promoting community-based care, the organization aims to phase out the practice of institutionalization in the near future.\n\nIn conclusion, Lumos, led by J.K.

The lead investigator, Eusebio Felix, or \"Felix the Fat Catcher,\" was suspended from his position due to his false statements.\n\nFelix had claimed that the suspects, known as \"Pishtacos,\" were based on a local Andean legend where travelers were attacked by a group who harvested their fat for valuable fat.

The PCTA reports a 300% increase in trail inquiries and permit requests since the release of \"Wild.\" The trail, which typically sees only around 3,346 completed through-hikes since its inception in the 1950s, is now attracting more than 4,000 through-hikers in 2016, with 500 planned for the southern part of the trail and hundreds more for section hikes. This has led to concerns about overcrowding, particularly in the desert areas, where the PCTA has implemented a daily permit quota system to protect the trail and its environment.\n\nThe increase in hikers has not only affected the number of permits issued but also the trail's natural resources, as more hikers require rescue services and strain on local communities. The PCTA's trail information specialist, Jack Haskel, notes that while the current system is working, it's crucial to maintain a balance to prevent overuse. The PCTA's #responsiblywild campaign, supported by Strayed, aims to promote safety and \"leave no trace\" principles.\n\nThe trend of women hikers is also on the rise, with the PCTA observing a shift from less than 10% to 30% of hikers being female.

Its feathers, found in a nearly complete fossil, displayed a rainbow-like iridescence, with structures similar to melanosomes in extant bird melanosomes. Caihong's head and chest had the most extensive iridescence, while its tail feathers contributed to a broad, sub-rectangular tail with large, organized vanes.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The tax's impact on local businesses, particularly small retailers, has been negative, with some stores experiencing drops in sales and potential job losses. A proposed tax in Seattle to expand the tax statewide has also been met with skepticism, with concerns about its impact on local businesses and potential for higher prices. The overall consensus is that these taxes, despite初衷, have not lived up to their promise and have instead fueled public discontent and a shift in consumer behavior.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol, were found to have a 29% higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD and a 37% higher risk of hyperkinetic syndrome, a rarer diagnosis. Researchers caution that the study does not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, as other factors, such as underlying infections, could be contributing to the increased ADHD risk. The丹麦 researchers, who analyzed data from 64,000 children and their mothers, suggested that pregnant women should avoid chronic or long-term use of acetaminophen, but not completely, as it is a common pain reliever. The American Medical Association's Dr. Beate Ritz, who co-authored the study, advises against overuse but warns that more research is needed.

However, Senate Democrats have refused to accept changes to the ACA, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any bill with these provisions. The House is likely to hold off on passing a bill with significant changes to the ACA until the last minute, potentially causing a short-term shutdown to appease conservative House Republicans.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid is pushing for a hardline Democratic strategy, encouraging the rejection of any attempts to alter the ACA and demanding that Republicans accept the law as it stands. The Senate has removed the ACA provisions from the funding bill, and the House's proposed delay of the ACA has faced division within the party, with some Republicans hoping for a win on the issue.\n\nThe government shutdown, if it occurs, would have significant economic consequences, with the Washington region, home to a large number of federal workers, expected to lose around $200 million per day and 700,000 jobs. The Senate and House will have to negotiate a spending bill by Monday, with the House's preference being to attach conditions to the ACA, while the Senate is likely to reject such provisions.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Despite the higher risk of advanced disease, younger patients have a slightly better survival rate, suggesting that the current screening guidelines might be too late for some.\n\nThe study's authors argue that the medical community should be aware of the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark blood in stool. However, the study's limitations, including the lack of data on family history and potential selection bias, raise questions about adjusting screening guidelines to start at a younger age.\n\nWhile some experts, like Dr. Andrew Chan, caution against expanding screening to younger ages due to the low risk, others, like Dr. Samantha Hendren, suggest the need for further research to determine if earlier screening could benefit more patients. The issue of long-term support for young survivors is also emerging as a critical aspect of addressing this growing trend in colorectal cancer.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

In a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a site dating back 49,000 years has been found, revealing evidence of human activity, including the use of fire, stone tools, and ochre, as well as the presence of megafauna bones. The discovery, made by La Trobe University's Giles Hamm and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard, challenges the commonly accepted timeline of human colonization in the country, suggesting a more extensive and earlier presence than previously thought.\n\nThe site, Warratyi, houses artifacts and fossils that date back to around 49,000 years, pushing the known record of human occupation in Australia's arid interior forward by 14,000 years. The use of ochre, a critical tool for early humans, was also identified at the site, indicating the development of complex cultural practices. The presence of bone tools and the interaction with megafauna, such as the extinct Diprotodon optatum, suggests a coexistence and possibly even hunting by early humans.\n\nThe excavation methods and dating processes, including the use of optical dating techniques, were carefully executed to minimize contamination and ensure accurate age estimates. The findings challenge the assumption that human settlement in the arid region was solely driven by climate, as the site's location near permanent springs indicates a more dynamic and adaptable population.\n\nThe discovery at Warratyi not only pushes the boundaries of human history in Australia but also contributes to the ongoing debate about the role of humans and climate change in the extinction of megafauna. The study, published in Nature, highlights the ingenuity and cultural evolution of the Indigenous Australians, challenging the traditional narrative of a more recent arrival in the region.\n\nOverall, these findings emphasize the complexity and diversity of human occupation in Australia and the need for continued research to fully understand the prehistory of the continent.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds a new twist to this concept, suggesting that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for survival as the universe expands and makes stars inaccessible.

The region's shifting climate, marked by frequent droughts and floods, forced foraging over larger areas with smaller tools, and the use of obsidian from distant sources, suggest the existence of trading networks among early humans.\n\nThe third passage focuses on the innovative stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie, which date back to 300,000 years ago. These hand axes, considered the \"Swiss army knife\" of the Stone Age, indicate a shift from scavenging to hunting and the potential for complex social interactions, including the exchange of obsidian and red pigments, possibly for signaling group identity or trade.\n\nThe fourth passage challenges the traditional view of a sudden \"human revolution\" around 40,000-50,000 years ago, arguing that modern behaviors, such as art, symbolism, and cultural complexity, were present in Africa much earlier than previously thought.

This incident raised questions about the president's judgment and the appropriateness of his presence during a medical emergency.\n\n2. President Trump's homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, defended the president's tweet targeting CNN, stating that it was not perceived as a threat.

The Lacey Act, which covers endangered species, was cited as the reason for the raid, as it requires end users to verify the legality of their wood supply chains.\n\nGibson CEO Henry Juszkiewicz denied the allegations, stating that the company had only continued to source wood from Madagascar legally after the 2009 raid. The U.S. Justice Department, however, is preparing a case against the company, citing emails that suggest knowledge of illegal timber practices. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and other experts, including the Lacey Act director, Andrea Johnson, have raised concerns about the accuracy of the accusations and the impact on the guitar industry.\n\nThe case highlights the intersection of music and environmental regulation, with the company facing the challenge of proving its compliance with the law. The situation has affected not only Gibson but also other guitar manufacturers, such as Chris Martin of the C.F.

This move came after days of rocket attacks on both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, with no significant casualties on the Israeli side but several deaths in Gaza, including civilians and Hamas fighters. Egypt's prime minister visited Gaza, expressing support for Hamas but also calling for a ceasefire, while the United States urged countries to pressure Hamas to stop rocket attacks.\n\nHamas, the ruling group in Gaza, claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted many of the rockets, but not all. The situation escalated as Israel intensified its airstrikes and considered a potential ground invasion.

{"pred": "In recent news, scientists have discovered significant evidence of a large ancient ocean on Mars, challenging the previously assumed arid and water-poor history of the planet. A massive body of water, covering nearly half of the northern hemisphere, existed around 4.5 billion years ago, comparable to Earth's Atlantic Ocean, according to data collected by NASA's telescopes. The ocean, which was 10 times larger than Mars' current polar ice caps, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, and its deuterium content suggests a global water layer up to 137 meters deep.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, used infrared telescopes to analyze the Martian atmosphere and found that water near the poles is highly enriched in deuterium, indicating that Mars had a global ocean with a high concentration of heavy hydrogen. This enrichment, combined with the planet's thinning atmosphere, suggests that a significant amount of water, equivalent to 6 times the current ice caps, must have been present in the past.\n\nThe presence of this ancient ocean raises the possibility of habitability on Mars, as it provides a more favorable environment for life. However, the exact amount of water and its distribution across the planet's surface remain uncertain due to the potential for additional water loss through the leakage of ordinary hydrogen into space. Mars' current climate and the lack of a permanent liquid surface make it less hospitable for life as we know it, but the discovery of this ancient ocean strengthens the case for past habitability on the Red Planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long associated with ferocious roars in popular culture, may not have sounded like the terrifying beasts we imagine, according to new research. The study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaur vocalizations, known as \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" were more akin to the coos of birds like doves or the mumbles of ostriches. These sounds were produced through a bulging of the throat, facilitated by a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch, which allowed for low, throaty sounds. The iconic \"Jurassic Park\" roar, a combination of animal noises like baby elephant cries and a sound engineer's creation, is not representative of the actual dinosaur vocalizations.\n\nDinosaurs, particularly large-bodied ones, may have had the ability to produce these sounds, as closed-mouth vocalizations evolved independently in 16 different animal lineages, including birds. The lack of preserved fossil evidence makes it difficult to determine the exact sounds dinosaurs made, but scientists believe they could have resembled the coos of doves or the hoots of birds.\n\nThe study also found that the sounds dinosaurs produced were likely \"closed-mouth\" vocalizations, not the full-throated roars often depicted in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" This is because the vocal cords, necessary for producing the deep, resonant sounds, are absent in dinosaurs, replaced by air sacs. The researchers suggest that large-bodied dinosaurs, like birds with proportionally large bodies, may have had similar vocal abilities.\n\nWhile the exact sounds remain uncertain, the study challenges the common perception of dinosaurs as roaring behemoths and opens up the possibility that they may have sounded more like the smaller birds of today.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way.

This breakthrough, known as \"mind reading\" or \"internal imagery reconstruction,\" suggests the possibility of someday viewing a person's dreams and thoughts without visual cues.\n\nThe study involved subjects lying still in an MRI machine, with their brain activity linked to specific visual elements in the videos.

It could also potentially lead to the development of devices that could transmit imagined imagery, particularly for individuals with paralysis who could use their thoughts to control devices.\n\nWhile the technology raises ethical concerns, particularly in the context of privacy and memory manipulation, the researchers emphasize the need for more research to refine the method and ensure its accuracy.

The speaker asserts that politicians, including both Republicans and Democrats, are aware that the sequester won't affect their own salaries, which are protected, while non-performing staff, such as congressional aides, will face a 20% pay cut. This has led to a perception that Congress is not likely to be deterred by the proposed cuts.\n\nIn summary, the news can be summarized as:\n\n1.

Bayesian methods, developed by statisticians, help refine and update search strategies in complex situations like underwater searches, where multiple factors like wind, ocean currents, and potential damage to the plane's communication devices influence the probability of finding the wreckage.\n\nIn the case of Flight 370, Bayesian analysis has been employed to determine the likelihood of the plane being in different locations based on new information, such as the possibility of a deliberate diversion. This approach adjusts the initial uniform probability distribution to account for flight paths, wind patterns, and the likelihood of the plane's position based on previous search efforts.\n\nThe search for Air France Flight 477, which also disappeared in 2009, demonstrates the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques in refining search strategies. Bayesian methods were used to analyze the probability of the plane's location and the likelihood of certain events, such as beacon malfunction, which led to the discovery of the wreckage.\n\nHowever, the use of Bayesian statistics in the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 case faces challenges due to the complexity of the situation, with the likelihood of the plane being in a specific location influenced by a change in the primary cause of the disappearance. Some experts argue that Bayesian methods may not be suitable for drastic changes in the situation, as they rely on a steady update of probabilities, whereas others believe they can adapt well to changing circumstances.\n\nDespite the challenges, Bayesian techniques provide a systematic approach to integrating new information and adjusting search strategies, making them valuable in the search for missing aircraft. The reliance on expert judgment and the flexibility of Bayesian methods in handling conflicting information is highlighted as a strength.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayesian statistics play a role in refining search efforts for missing aircraft, but their effectiveness depends on the nature of the case and the availability of reliable data.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

This incident, described as \"an unthinkable kind of situation\" by the judge, added to Egeland's 10-year federal prison sentence for mortgage fraud. The additional time was imposed due to his guilty plea in a conspiracy to commit wire fraud and interstate failure to pay child support.\n\nEgeland's scheme involved his son, Rylan, who was directed to shoot him in the legs in July 2014, just a day before Egeland was scheduled to begin his 10-year prison term. The insurance scam was designed to delay Egeland's imprisonment and capitalize on a fraudulent disability insurance policy. However, the plan backfired, and Egeland's health took a severe turn, leading to the amputation of his left leg.\n\nAssistantU.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown criticized Egeland for his manipulation and the emotional toll it took on his son. In the second article, Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Bradford described Egeland as a \"menace to society\" who had been involved in various criminal activities, including fraud and perjury.

The severity of the crash was attributed to the crushed crash attenuator, a safety feature that was not functioning properly due to the lack of maintenance.\n\nTesla has emphasized that Autopilot, while not preventing all accidents, significantly reduces the risk of fatalities. They claim that Autopilot has reduced crash rates by 40% in the US and that equipped Tesla vehicles have a fatality rate three times lower than non-autonomous vehicles.

{"pred": "In the first two phases of Egypt's parliamentary elections, the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party has shown significant gains, leading in the polls and raising concerns about the Islamists' potential to consolidate their power in the new parliament. The final round of voting, which covered nine provinces, took place amidst a backdrop of political tensions and the ongoing trial of former President Hosni Mubarak, who is accused of tyranny and oppression. The trial, with prosecutor Mustafa Soliman describing Mubarak as a \"tyrant,\" highlights the public's desire for accountability and the struggle between the Brotherhood, the military council, and liberal factions for political influence. Economic challenges, with slowing growth and declining foreign currency reserves, further complicate the political landscape. The outcome of the elections remains uncertain, with the military council yet to clarify the distribution of seats among parties, leaving the formation of a new government uncertain. The anniversary of the uprising that led to Mubarak's downfall is approaching, and protests are expected to continue, adding to the political pressure.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

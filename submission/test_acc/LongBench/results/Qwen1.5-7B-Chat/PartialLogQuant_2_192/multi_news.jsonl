Researchers from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, including Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, have found that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resilience of MRSA, making it more difficult to combat.\n\nCigarette smoke, according to the research, stresses MRSA by altering its cell walls, making it less susceptible to the immune system's defenses. Specifically, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes more resistant to reactive oxygen species, which are released by immune cells to fight off infections. This resistance is demonstrated by the bacteria's ability to withstand the antimicrobial peptides that normally break down bacterial cell walls.\n\nThe study shows that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA is not only more resistant to antibiotics but also more adept at infecting human cells. It becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing and is even more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. The bacteria's cell walls are modified, allowing it to evade immune responses and survive longer, increasing its chances of causing infection and survival.\n\nCrotty Alexander and her team found that cigarette smoke exposure significantly enhances MRSA's ability to adhere to human cells and causes a 10-fold increase in surface changes compared to e-cigarette vapor exposure. This resistance to antibiotics and enhanced invasiveness pose a significant concern, as it could lead to increased mortality in mice infected with smoke-exposed MRSA.\n\nThe research suggests that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also aids in the survival and aggression of MRSA, potentially contributing to increased susceptibility to infections in smokers.

The cause is unknown, but the virus EV-D68 has been linked to previous outbreaks, though it was not detected in the specimens of affected patients in 2014. Enteroviruses, particularly EV-D68, are believed to be a contributing factor, but the CDC has not found a definitive link. There is no specific cure for AFM, and treatment involves supportive care and rehabilitation. Parents and healthcare providers are advised to practice good hygiene and be vigilant for symptoms, reporting any suspected cases to the CDC.

{"pred": "The Shroud of Turin, a revered artifact believed to be the burial cloth of Jesus, has experienced renewed scrutiny over its authenticity after a recent scientific investigation. Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found them to be inconsistent with a person lying flat, as previously thought. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions and found that the blood flow on the shroud does not match the reported wounds of a crucified individual.\n\nThe researchers tested the blood consistency with both human and synthetic blood, focusing on specific body parts like the hand, forearm, chest, and waist. The blood flow patterns on the shroud indicate that the wounds, particularly on the hand, do not align with the standard angle for a person hanging crucified, with rivulets appearing at 45-degree angles instead of the expected 90-degree angles. The analysis also revealed that the \"lumbar stain,\" which is supposed to represent blood from the back, was not replicated in any position.\n\nThese inconsistencies, according to the investigators, point to the possibility that the bloodstains on the shroud are not consistent with a single event but rather from multiple poses, suggesting a standing model was used to create the blood patterns. The study challenges the traditional belief that the shroud is an authentic representation of the crucifixion wounds and raises questions about the authenticity of the cloth.\n\nWhile the Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, this forensic investigation adds to the ongoing debate about its authenticity and calls for further scientific analysis. The researchers' findings, though not conclusive, have sparked interest in using forensic techniques to investigate the shroud and potentially shed light on the enigmatic image's creation.", "answers": ["The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion; bloodstains on the linen shroud, which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb, form the image of a crucified man.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The founder, inspired by a photograph that sparked her to action, realized that the majority of children in institutions are not orphans but are often placed due to poverty, lack of local services, or disability. Lumos' mission is to raise awareness about these issues and advocate for change.\n\nThe founder, George Mulheir, shares a harrowing story from a residential institution that led to the establishment of Lumos. The charity works to expose the harsh conditions in these institutions and advocate for alternative, family-based care. The article emphasizes that the majority of children in institutions are not orphans but have parents who can care for them, often due to misinformation or limited resources.\n\nLumos aims to eradicate global child institutionalization by 2050 through partnerships, investments in education and healthcare, and fostering or adoption alternatives. The organization has seen significant progress in countries like Moldova, where there has been a 70% decrease in children in institutions, and the Czech Republic, where the number of children in institutions is falling and foster care placements increasing.\n\nThe founder's personal commitment to the cause, as demonstrated by her decision to become president for life, underscores the urgency of addressing this issue. The article also highlights the launch of the #Letstalklumos campaign, which seeks to raise awareness and encourage public engagement in ending child institutionalization.\n\nIn summary, Lumos, led by J.K. Rowling, is working tirelessly to combat child institutionalization by shedding light on the situation, advocating for change, and making progress in several countries.

Rowling wants to change that, not by improving these orphanages with \"pretty murals\" or teddy bears, but by eliminating them altogether, she writes in the Guardian. The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

Here's a summary:\n\n1. In 1994 and 1995, Japan's cult Aum Shinrikyo used VX in attacks, raising concerns about North Korea's potential chemical weapons capabilities. North Korea has been accused of possessing a large arsenal of chemical weapons, including VX, which is considered a weapon of mass destruction.\n\n2. Malaysia's police announced that the VX nerve agent was used in Kim Jong-nam's death, implicating North Korea in the attack. However, North Korea denied any involvement and accused Malaysia of fabricating evidence. The North Korean government also accused Malaysia of having \"sinister\" intentions.\n\n3. The toxicology report indicates that the VX was applied to Kim's face, causing immediate effects on him and the woman who came into contact with it. The agent, which is persistent and lethal, raised concerns about potential contamination in the airport and other areas the victims had visited.\n\n4. The use of VX is considered extraordinary due to its rarity and the fact that it requires a highly trained operator. A small amount can be lethal, and the attack on Kim Jong-nam was believed to involve a diversionary spray and a direct application of the poison.\n\n5. The Malaysian authorities are investigating how the VX entered the country and are considering the possibility that it was brought in through clothing or other means. North Korea's refusal to cooperate with the investigation and its accusations against Malaysia have fueled the diplomatic tensions between the two nations.\n\n6. Kim Jong-nam, who was traveling under a false identity, had a history of criticizing the North Korean regime and was seen as a potential threat to the leadership. His death has raised questions about the regime's security and the role of chemical weapons in their arsenal.\n\n7. The case has exposed the potential for North Korea to have connections with other countries involved in chemical weapons, such as the possibility of sharing expertise with Syria, Iran, or other non-signatories to the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n8. The Malaysian government has taken steps to decontaminate the airport and areas associated with the suspects, but the persistence of VX raises concerns about the long-term health risks for those who may have been exposed.\n\n9.

He said that one of two women believed to have rubbed the extremely toxic substance on Kim's face with their hands suffered from vomiting after the attack. The New York Times reports that VX agent can be created by mixing two compounds—and police suspect the two women put the substances on Kim's face, one after the other, to create a deadly dose. The police chief said the airport where Kim was attacked is now being decontaminated.

The first article reports that Eusebio Felix, the country's top organized crime investigator, was put on leave after misleading the public by claiming to have caught a group of \"Pishtacos,\" a mythical Andean legend, who were responsible for up to 60 murders and selling their victims' fat for profit. The investigation, which involved police displaying human fat as evidence, turned out to be a fabrication, with only one possible murder victim and no evidence of the fat being sold for commercial purposes.\n\nThe second article further details the case, revealing that police initially reported the suspects as confessing to the murders, using the myth as a motive. However, after weeks of doubt, the investigation was found to be flawed, with police in the affected region acknowledging that there was only one murder and linking the suspects to the cocaine trade. The police chief, General Miguel Hidalgo, expressed embarrassment and the need to restore the reputation of the police force. The incident has sparked criticism from anthropologists, doctors, and politicians, who argue that the story was a baseless attempt to explain a crime and may have contributed to a decline in tourism in the region.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights a series of missteps by law enforcement in Peru, resulting in a tarnished reputation for the police and a loss of credibility in their investigations.

The PCTA, which manages the trail, reports a 300% increase in website traffic and hiking permit requests since the release of \"Wild.\" The movie has not only raised awareness about the trail but has also led to an increase in long-distance hikers and potential encounters with overcrowding. The PCT, which typically allows 500-600 people to hike the entire 2,650-mile stretch annually, faces a challenge with the current 50 permits per day quota, as it has been almost fully subscribed in 2016. The PCTA implemented the quota system to manage the impact on the trail and its fragile desert ecosystems, as well as to prevent overuse and environmental damage.\n\nCheryl Strayed's hike, though a transformative experience for her, has sparked a debate among hikers about the wisdom of intentionally entering a challenging journey with little preparation, hoping to find salvation through the physical activity. Some argue that a lack of preparedness and a \"deliberate ineptitude\" approach can lead to problems for both the individual hiker and the trail itself. The PCTA has launched a campaign, #responsiblywild, to promote Leave No Trace principles and encourage hikers to consider the trail's impact on the environment and fellow hikers.\n\nThe increase in female hikers, as suggested by the PCTA, is another trend observed, with more women being inspired by Strayed's story. However, this has led to concerns about overcrowding, particularly in the Southern portion of the trail. The PCTA's permit system, while addressing some of these issues, may not be enough to accommodate the growing interest in the PCT, necessitating a continued conversation about responsible hiking and managing the trail's popularity.", "answers": ["Hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail can expect to encounter harsh-but-beautiful landscapes, extreme fatigue, and—these days, at least—traffic. \"You can’t talk about the Pacific Crest Trail without mentioning the crowds,\" Pete Brook writes for Outside.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

Its feathers, found in a nearly complete fossil, displayed a rainbow-like iridescence, with structures similar to melanosomes in extant bird feathers. Caihong's head and chest had particularly vibrant colors, suggesting they may have served a communicative purpose, possibly for attracting mates or displaying dominance. The dinosaur's feathers, along with its long tail feathers, indicate a possible connection to the evolution of feathers in birds, as it possesses asymmetrical feathers, a feature seen in some early birds but not in all. The study also highlights the diversity of feather patterns and colors in non-avian dinosaurs, suggesting that iridescence and other feather adaptations were not unique to birds but evolved earlier in the evolutionary tree.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

Dr. Beate Ritz, the lead author, advises pregnant women to avoid chronic or long-term use of acetaminophen, but acknowledges that the drug is still useful for managing mild pain during infections like influenza. Other experts, like Dr. Jeff Chapa, suggest that pregnant women should consider non-pharmacological methods for pain relief and avoid excessive use of any medication, including acetaminophen, without consulting a doctor.

The reliquary, once part of an early Christian basilica, is considered a rare find due to its connection to this period when pilgrimage to the Holy Land for healing purposes was common.\n\nIn addition to the relic, the 2014 excavations at the fortress of Burgas, also known as Poros, revealed a 10th-century Bulgarian royal seal. The site also housed a 6th-century basilica, a 5th-6th-century AD building complex, and a 1st-century AD latrine.

The discovery, reported in the Astronomical Journal, has sparked excitement among some astronomers, who argue that it could reshape our understanding of the solar system's formation.\n\nMichael Brown, known as \"Pluto Killer\" due to his role in the demotion of Pluto from the official planet list, now believes he and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, have gathered enough evidence to support the existence of Planet Nine.

However, the study's limitations, including the lack of data on family history and potential selection bias, suggest that altering screening guidelines might not be the sole solution.\n\nThe American Cancer Society's guidelines recommend starting CRC screening for people aged 45 or older, but the recent study findings prompt a debate about whether this age should be lowered. Some experts, like Harvard's Andrew Chan, argue that the increased incidence of CRC in younger individuals could be due to environmental factors like smoking, obesity, and unhealthy diets. However, others, like Samantha Hendren, believe more research is needed to determine if earlier screening would be beneficial and cost-effective.\n\nIn the meantime, doctors are encouraged to be vigilant for early warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as dark blood in stool, and to consider referring patients with risk factors for more frequent screening. The long-term implications for these younger survivors, including their physical and emotional well-being, are also a concern for the medical community.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

In a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a site dating back 49,000 years has been found, revealing one of the most important prehistoric sites in Australian prehistory. The discovery, made during a survey, was made possible by a chance encounter when an archaeologist needed to use the toilet. The site contains evidence of human activity, including fire-making and the use of sophisticated tools, as well as the presence of megafauna bones, indicating coexistence and possibly interaction between humans and these large animals.\n\nThe site challenges the commonly accepted timeline of human arrival in Australia, with evidence suggesting that humans reached the northern parts of the continent as early as 49,000 years ago, contradicting the previously estimated 50,000-year mark. The presence of well-preserved ochre and bone tools, as well as the use of these technologies, indicates a more advanced technological and cultural development than previously thought.\n\nThe Warratyi site also holds significance due to the discovery of the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and the southern hemisphere, which was dated to around 49,000-46,000 years ago. This finding pushes back the understanding of the development of these technologies and the use of ochre, which has been a crucial tool for communication and artistic expression.\n\nThe study, led by La Trobe University's Giles Hamm, underscores the ingenuity of Indigenous Australians in adapting to the harsh arid environment, as evidenced by the establishment of settlements and the use of advanced tools. The dating of artefacts, particularly the bone and quartz tools, supports the hypothesis that humans colonized the region earlier than previously believed.\n\nThe findings challenge the prevailing narrative that human colonization in Australia occurred solely from the coastal regions, suggesting a more complex and diverse spread of innovations across the continent. The collaboration between the Adnyamathanha Traditional Lands Association and the researchers highlights the importance of local knowledge and the role of traditional custodians in understanding the past.\n\nThe research also underscores the need for continued scrutiny and refinement of dating techniques, as the dating of artefacts like the stone axe remains a topic of debate.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The tools found in the Olorgesailie Basin, Kenya, are the oldest of their kind, with evidence suggesting long-distance communication through the use of obsidian, a rare material that required trading. The second passage focuses on the discovery of Middle Stone Age tools in the region, which were smaller and more specialized, possibly indicating a shift from foraging to hunting and the establishment of trading networks due to changing environmental conditions. The tools were made from both local and distant sources, suggesting increased mobility and cooperation among early humans.\n\nThe third passage highlights the significance of the Olorgesailie Basin findings, which challenge the traditional view of a sudden \"human revolution\" occurring outside of Africa. Researchers found evidence of stone tools and pigment use, suggesting a technological and cultural evolution around 300,000 years ago, before the emergence of Homo sapiens. This period was marked by frequent climate changes, which forced early humans to adapt and innovate, potentially leading to the formation of trading networks.\n\nThe fourth passage disputes the idea of a single \"human revolution\" and argues that modern behaviors, such as symbolism and art, may have emerged earlier in the African stone age, around 280,000 to 50,000 years ago, as suggested by the study at Olorgesailie. This evidence challenges the notion that modern behaviors were exclusive to the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa and implies a more complex and gradual process of cultural and technological evolution.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the adaptive responses of early humans to shifting climates, the development of specialized tools and trading networks, and the complex interplay of environmental and cultural changes that led to the emergence of modern human behaviors in Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

This move came after days of rocket attacks on both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, causing no casualties but damaging infrastructure.

{"pred": "In recent news, scientists have discovered significant evidence of a large ancient ocean on Mars, challenging the previously assumed arid and water-poor history of the planet. A massive body of water, covering around 20% of the northern hemisphere, similar to the Atlantic on Earth, was inferred from Mars' atmospheric data collected by NASA's telescopes. The water, estimated to be up to 137 meters deep, persisted for millions of years and was enriched in deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, indicating a global ocean on Mars.\n\nThe deuterium enrichment suggests that Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 4.5 billion years ago, with some basins and high-altitude regions showing even higher enrichments. Researchers have found that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to a level of 8 times Earth's standard, suggesting a significant water loss from the planet.\n\nA study published in the journal Science further supports the presence of a global ocean, with the concentration of deuterium in the atmosphere indicating a water loss of at least 6 times the current Martian ice caps. This water loss could have created a global ocean that covered 13% of the planet, similar to the coverage on Earth during its early days.\n\nNASA's Mars missions, including the Curiosity rover, have also contributed to the understanding of Mars' water history. The detection of methane on Mars has raised questions about the possibility of life, but the exact origin and persistence of such methane remain uncertain.\n\nOverall, these findings challenge the conventional view of Mars and open up new possibilities for the planet's habitability and the potential for past microbial life.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, the court found that Nestlé had not proven the shape was distinctive enough across all EU member states.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long associated with ferocious roars in popular culture, may not have sounded like the terrifying beasts we imagine, according to new research. The study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaur vocalizations, known as \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" were more akin to the coos of birds like doves or pigeons, rather than the screams or roars we associate with them. These sounds, produced through a bulging throat, were likely similar to the quiet coos of modern birds with large bodies, like pigeons and cassowaries.\n\nThe iconic \"Jurassic Park\" dinosaurs' roars were created using a blend of animal sounds, including baby elephant cries, tiger chuffs, and a gurgling alligator, mixed in a sound studio. The actual dinosaur vocalizations might have resembled the coos of birds, not the loud, high-pitched calls often portrayed in films.\n\nThe researchers found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are low, throaty sounds, were more common in large-bodied birds like doves and pigeons, suggesting that large dinosaurs, like T. rex, might have had similar abilities. The lack of fossil evidence for dinosaur vocalizations makes it difficult to pinpoint specifics, but the study highlights the diversity in the sounds dinosaurs might have produced.\n\nThe evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds is thought to have occurred independently in different animal lineages, with the trait evolving in large-bodied species as a way to communicate, particularly in mating displays. The study's authors emphasize that understanding dinosaur vocalizations requires considering the unique anatomy of these ancient creatures, which may have included a bird-like syrinx, allowing for low-frequency sounds.\n\nIn conclusion, the dinosaur soundscape was likely more complex than previously imagined, with a mix of realistic animal noises and creative sound design in movies like \"Jurassic Park.\" The discovery of closed-mouth vocalizations challenges our preconceived notions of dinosaur communication and underscores the mystery surrounding these long-extinct creatures.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The PS4, led by system architect Mark Cerny, aims to prioritize gaming experience over technology, with a focus on accessibility and ease of development. The PS4 is described as an advanced x86-based personal computer, designed to simplify game development compared to the previous PlayStation 3. The system includes a powerful x86 CPU and a custom GPU, allowing for easier creation of games and improved performance.\n\nCerny highlighted the evolution of the PS4, acknowledging that the early PS3's limitations due to tech constraints influenced the design. The PS4's tech is not centered on raw processing power, but rather on creating a platform that prioritizes user experience. The device features a DualShock 4 controller with a touchpad and a 3D stereo camera, similar to the Xbox Kinect, for enhanced gameplay and social features.\n\nThe PS4's hardware also supports quick save states and background downloading, mimicking mobile gaming trends. The system is designed to be more accessible for developers, addressing the difficulties faced with the previous PlayStation generation. The company also revealed a redesigned DualShock 4 controller with improved tracking capabilities.\n\nIn terms of graphics, the PS4's live demos showcased impressive visuals, comparable to high-end PC gaming, but not revolutionary. The console is expected to have a local HDD with no mention of solid-state storage, and there's no confirmation on the price or console design.\n\nOverall, the PlayStation 4 represents a significant upgrade from the previous generation, focusing on user-friendly gaming experiences and leveraging the power of a traditional PC architecture.

By analyzing the brain patterns associated with visual information, the researchers were able to generate a video that reflected the subjects' thoughts, essentially creating a \"Surrealist\" version of their experiences. This is the first time that scientists have been able to continuously reconstruct dynamic visual experiences from brain activity, rather than just static images.\n\nThe technology holds promise for future applications, such as decoding dreams and thoughts, as it could potentially reveal what's happening in our minds without external visual cues. However, the current level of resolution is limited by the need for large amounts of computing power and the complexity of the brain's visual processing.\n\nThe researchers are also exploring the possibility of using this technology to reconstruct internal imagery, which could be useful for individuals with paralysis who could control their environment through imagined movements. While the technology raises ethical concerns, particularly in the realm of privacy and memory recall, the potential for enhancing communication and understanding of inner experiences is evident.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

{"pred": "The news articles discuss the use of Bayesian statistics in the search for missing aircraft, specifically focusing on the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the Air France Flight 447. Bayesian methods, developed by statisticians, help refine and update search strategies in complex situations like the missing plane's location and the cause of its disappearance.\n\nIn the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Bayesian tools were applied to analyze flight data, wind patterns, and ocean currents to determine the probability of the plane's location. The search was influenced by new information, such as the possibility of a deliberate diversion, which shifted the focus to specific areas. Bayesian inference allows for the integration of new data and expert judgment, making the search more flexible and adaptable.\n\nThe Air France Flight 477 search, in which Bayesian methods were used, involved simulating the movement of debris and adjusting for the possibility of equipment failure. The Bayesian approach, despite its limitations, proved successful in locating the plane's wreckage.\n\nHowever, the current search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 faces additional complexities due to the likelihood of a deliberate act causing the disappearance, which increases the probability of the plane's location being in areas further from the initial point of departure. Bayesian statisticians, like those from Metron Scientific Solutions, are involved in the search, but their methods are not without challenges, as Bayesian calculations can become more complicated when dealing with changing circumstances.\n\nSome experts argue that Bayesian statistics might not be the best fit for the Malaysia Airlines case, as it relies on a stable foundation of previous experiences, which may not be applicable given the unique circumstances. However, Bayesian techniques can provide valuable discipline and help in adapting to new information, as demonstrated by the successful recovery of the Air France Flight 477's wreckage.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayesian statistics, though not without its limitations, plays a crucial role in the search for missing aircraft by integrating available data and adjusting probabilities based on new information. The application of these methods in the Malaysia Airlines case highlights the importance of subjectivity and the need for careful interpretation in complex search operations.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

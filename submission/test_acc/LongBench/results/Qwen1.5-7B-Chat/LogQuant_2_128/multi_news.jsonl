Researchers from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, including Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, have found that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resilience of MRSA, making it more difficult to combat and causing it to become more aggressive.\n\nCigarette smoke, according to the studies, stresses MRSA by altering its cell walls, making it less susceptible to the immune system's defenses. Specifically, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract is more resistant to reactive oxygen species, antimicrobial peptides, and even adheres better to human cells, enhancing its ability to invade and cause infections. The study found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was four times more resistant to macrophage killing and 20% more resistant to antimicrobial peptides.\n\nThe researchers observed that cigarette smoke exposure not only makes MRSA more resilient but also prolongs its resistance, as exposed bacteria showed increased resistance even 24 hours after initial exposure. In lab experiments, cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more lethal to mice and more effective at infecting human cells than MRSA not exposed to smoke.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also aids in the survival and virulence of MRSA, contributing to increased infections and hospitalizations. The study's lead author, Dr. Crotty Alexander, warns that this could be an additional factor contributing to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases.\n\nA related study by the same team found that e-cigarette vapor also has a similar effect, making MRSA more resistant, although the smoke from cigarettes appears to have a stronger impact.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found them to be inconsistent with a body lying flat, as previously suggested by the cloth's design. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions and angles, comparing the blood flow on the cloth to those observed on the Shroud. The analysis revealed that the bloodstains do not match the reported positions, pointing towards a standing model being used to create the images, rather than a person hanging from a cross.\n\nThe researchers found that the rivulets on the hand and the angle of the blood flow on the arm do not align with the reported position on the shroud, suggesting a standing position for the model. The bloodstains from the \"lance wound\" in the torso, which contains iron oxide consistent with pigment or blood, also do not match the expected direction. The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, challenges the commonly held belief that the blood on the shroud represents the actual crucifixion wounds of Jesus.\n\nWhile the Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, this investigation raises doubts about its authenticity and calls for further scientific analysis.

The organization, named after the spell from the Harry Potter series, has been instrumental in shedding light on the plight of millions of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. The founder, inspired by a photograph that triggered her to action, began writing letters to influential figures, leading to the establishment of Lumos and its mission to combat this issue.\n\nLumos' CEO, Georgette Mulheir, shares the harrowing reality of these institutions, describing conditions that are often inhumane and detrimental to children's physical and mental well-being. The majority of these children are not orphans but are placed in institutions due to a lack of adequate care and support in their homes. The problem is particularly acute in countries like Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where significant progress has been made in reducing the number of children in institutions.\n\nThe author emphasizes that the solution lies not in improving institutions but in eliminating them altogether. Lumos aims to eradicate institutionalization globally by 2050 through investments in education, healthcare, family-based care, and fostering. The charity's work is supported by international donors, and their success in countries like Moldova and the Czech Republic demonstrates the feasibility of such a goal.\n\nThe urgency of the issue is highlighted, as the author points out that the practice of institutionalization is not only morally reprehensible but also economically inefficient. By supporting families and communities, the long-term costs of caring for children in institutions can be significantly reduced.\n\nFinally, the launch of the #Letstalklumos campaign, led by J.K. Rowling, aims to raise awareness and encourage public engagement in ending this harmful practice. With her commitment to serve as president for life, the hope is to create a world where the thought of institutionalizing children becomes a thing of the past.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic.

However, the investigation was later found to be a fabrication, with only one possible murder victim and no evidence of the fat being sold for profit.\n\nThe case began when Felix claimed that the gang, consisting of up to 60 people, had been caught and was linked to the export of human fat, which was presented as evidence during a press conference.

However, the PCTA, concerned about the impact of a large number of inexperienced hikers, has implemented a 50-permit daily quota system to manage the trail's resources and prevent overuse. This has led to a mix of opinions, with some hikers enjoying the trail and others concerned about the strain on the environment and the need for responsible behavior.\n\nThe trail, known for its Leave No Trace principles, encourages self-sufficiency but warns against the dangers of arriving unprepared. The PCTA is promoting the use of the hashtag #responsiblywild to emphasize the importance of respecting the trail and its surroundings.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol, were found to have a 29% higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD and a 37% higher risk of hyperkinetic syndrome, a rarer diagnosis. The researchers, however, caution that this does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship and advise against chronic or long-term use of the drug. The study, based on the Danish National Birth Cohort, suggests that taking acetaminophen for more than 20 weeks during pregnancy may be associated with these risks. While acetaminophen is generally considered safe during pregnancy, the FDA has recommended limiting its use due to concerns about potential harm to the developing fetus. Other experts, like Dr. Beate Ritz, emphasize the need for further research and advise pregnant women to consult with their doctors before using any medication, particularly acetaminophen. The study's authors and Dr. Jeff Chapa, a neurologist, both acknowledge that other factors, such as genetic predispositions and environmental influences, may contribute to ADHD.

Despite initial objections from Gloria, who was in Hawaii at the time, she has remained devoted to him and has only been allowed to visit him in prison once a year for conjugal visits. During these visits, they spend time together, making pizza, watching TV, and engaging in intimate activities. Chapman's latest parole hearing is scheduled for the week starting August 20, and if granted, it would mark a significant milestone in his life sentence.\n\nIn the news, it is revealed that Chapman initially told his wife about his plans to kill Lennon, but she believed him until the news broke. After the murder, she understood the truth and has maintained her loyalty to him, despite the abuse he inflicted during their one-year marriage. The parole board has taken into account Chapman's behavior behind bars, which has led to some notorious criminals, including police killers, being released on parole in recent years.

House Speaker John Boehner has proposed a bill to fund the government until December 15, with conditions including a one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and a repeal of the medical device tax. However, Senate Democrats have refused to accept changes to the ACA, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any bill with these provisions. The Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, is pursuing a tough Democratic strategy, encouraging a no-compromise approach to the ACA and demanding that Republicans accept the law's delay.\n\nIn the House, Speaker Boehner is facing pressure from conservative Republicans who want to push for a full repeal of the ACA. If the House passes a bill with the ACA conditions, it is unlikely to be accepted by the Senate without changes, potentially leading to a government shutdown.

The House and Senate must pass a bill by the Monday deadline, or a partial government shutdown will occur. The potential for a shutdown could have significant economic impacts, particularly in the Washington region, where federal agencies account for a large portion of the local economy.

There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains.

Planet Nine, estimated to be around five to ten times the mass of the Earth, has been inferred from the gravitational influence it exerts on smaller objects in the outer solar system. The discovery, reported in a paper published in the Astronomical Journal, has raised excitement among some astronomers, who argue that it could reshape our understanding of the solar system's formation.\n\nMichael Brown, known as \"Pluto Killer\" due to his role in the demotion of Pluto from the official planet list, and his colleague Konstantin Batygin believe they have compiled enough evidence to support the existence of Planet Nine. They have not directly observed the planet but have deduced its presence based on the orbits of distant dwarf planets and other small objects. Planet Nine's existence, if confirmed, would challenge the current definition of a planet, as Pluto's demotion in 2006 was largely due to the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) reclassification rules.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine has led to debates about the planet's definition, with some astronomers like NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, cautioning that extraordinary evidence is required for confirmation.

The significance of the site lies in the presence of burned rock art, indicating the use of fire and human activity, as well as the discovery of stone tools and ochre, which pushes back the known dates for the development of these technologies in Australia.\n\nThe site challenges the commonly accepted timeline of human arrival in Australia, with the latest research suggesting a colonization date of around 49,000 years ago, earlier than previously thought. The presence of megafauna bones, such as the giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum, and the use of ochre for the first time in Australia indicate a complex interaction between humans and these megafauna. The site also includes evidence of human interaction with the environment, as evidenced by the presence of burnt eggshells, suggesting both habitation and possibly the use of fire for cooking.\n\nThe dating of the site, artifacts, and fossils was crucial in determining the age of the human occupation, with the evidence placing it between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago. The study highlights the ingenuity of early humans in adapting to the arid environment, as they established settlements and developed advanced technologies like bone axes and ochre use, even in the harsh conditions of the Flinders Ranges.\n\nThe findings challenge the prevailing theory that humans only reached the central interior of the country around 50,000 years ago, suggesting a more rapid expansion and earlier interactions with the environment. The study, published in Nature, contributes to the ongoing debate about the role of climate and human activity in the extinction of megafauna, as it presents evidence of coexistence and potential hunting of these animals by humans.\n\nOverall, the Warratyi site provides valuable insights into the early history of human settlement in Australia and underscores the adaptability and cultural richness of the indigenous population.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News. Hamm was surveying a section of Australia's Flinders Ranges when his partner, aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard, had to go to the bathroom. \"Nature called and Cliff walked up this creek bed into this gorge and found this amazing spring surrounded by rock art,\" Hamm says. At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

The show initially focused on lampooning local news and the conventions of the time, using humor to criticize the pop culture and lifestyle aspects of news coverage. Jon Stewart, who took over the show in 1999, shifted the focus to be more pointed, addressing issues like the lack of substance in news coverage and the need for a more informed perspective. The show's format included guest interviews, parodying political figures, and commentary on current events. During Stewart's tenure, there were conflicts with the writers, particularly after he fired some and demanded they adhere to his vision for the show. Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent, joined the show and became a key figure, contributing to the shift towards more political satire. The Daily Show thrived during a period of media upheaval, with the rise of cable news networks like Fox News and MSNBC, and the show's influence extended beyond lampooning, influencing the media landscape and shaping public opinion. The show's success led to Steve Carell's character, Steve Carell, becoming a prominent correspondent and eventually transitioning to hosting the show after Stewart's departure.

The first passage discusses a study revealing that dramatic climate shifts around 320,000 years ago may have driven the development of tool-making advancements and trading networks among early humans, specifically Homo sapiens or their relatives. The tools found in the Olorgesailie Basin, Kenya, include larger, more primitive tools from before and after the shift to Middle Stone Age, suggesting climate-driven behavioral changes. The tools, particularly obsidian, indicate long-distance communication and trading, possibly hinting at the emergence of early trading networks among Homo sapiens.\n\nThe second passage focuses on the latest research revealing the Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age tools, which are the oldest of their kind, dating back to 320,000 years ago. These tools, featuring downsized hand axes, suggest adaptation to changing environmental conditions, with frequent shifts between wet and dry periods. The presence of obsidian from distant locations hints at the development of trading networks among early humans.\n\nThe third passage highlights the significance of the Olorgesailie discoveries, with researchers suggesting that the region's Middle Stone Age tools and pigment use indicate a more advanced level of social organization, possibly involving the exchange of resources and the establishment of long-distance social networks.

The Lacey Act, which covers endangered species, was cited as the reason for the raid, but the company disputes the claims, stating they believed their wood sourcing was legal.\n\nGibson CEO Henry Juszkiewicz described the raid as a \"raid without cause,\" as the government did not provide specific evidence or charge them with a crime.

The situation highlights the intersection of music and environmental regulation, with the U.S. Justice Department potentially pursuing a case against the iconic guitar manufacturer.\n\nIn addition to the Gibson case, the Lacey Act's impact on the guitar industry is discussed, with some companies like C.F. Martin Guitar Co.'s Chris Martin supporting the regulation, believing it helps combat illegal logging. However, there are concerns among attorneys representing guitar builders who fear retroactive application of the law, as it could force them to prove the provenance of wood they've used for decades.\n\nThe situation has led to a shift in the guitar industry, with dealers like George Gruhn, a prominent collector and dealer, warning about the potential consequences for importing vintage instruments.

{"pred": "In recent news, scientists have discovered significant evidence of a large ancient ocean on Mars, challenging the previously assumed arid and water-poor history of the planet. A massive ocean, covering nearly half of the northern hemisphere, existed around 4.5 billion years ago, with a volume comparable to that of Earth's Atlantic Ocean. The ocean was composed of heavy hydrogen-rich water, as indicated by the detection of a high concentration of deuterium, a byproduct of water loss due to Mars' weak atmosphere. \n\nNASA's research, using powerful telescopes, has revealed that the ancient Martian atmosphere had a high level of deuterium-enriched water, suggesting a global ocean that was 137 meters deep. This water loss has been inferred from the depletion of normal hydrogen, with the remaining deuterium-rich water concentrated in the planet's polar regions. The study also indicates that Mars had a more hospitable environment for life, as the presence of liquid water for millions of years raises the possibility of past habitability.\n\nA separate study found that Mars may have had a global water layer 4.5 billion years ago, with water ice enriched in deuterium to levels as high as 8 times Earth's standard, suggesting a more substantial water presence than previously thought. The high deuterium content in certain basins and high-altitude regions suggests a significant water loss over time.\n\nThese discoveries challenge the conventional understanding of Mars' history, with the potential for past life on the planet becoming more plausible. However, the exact amount of water and the likelihood of life existing on Mars remain subjects of ongoing investigation.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, the court found that Nestlé had not proven the shape was distinctive enough across all EU markets. This means the EU's Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must reconsider its decision and potentially revoke the trademark. The ruling has implications for other brands, as it suggests that a product's trademark status must be recognized in every EU country for it to be considered distinctive. The case is not yet closed, as Nestlé and Mondelez, the owner of KitKat, are expected to continue their legal battle, with Nestlé stating that it believes the EU trademark office will uphold its position. The legal battle over KitKat's shape, first introduced in 2002, has been a long-standing issue, with both companies vying for protection in the European market.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long associated with ferocious roars in popular culture, may not have sounded like the terrifying beasts we imagine, according to new research. The study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaur vocalizations, known as \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" were more akin to the coos of birds like doves or the mumbles of ostriches. These sounds were likely produced through the closure of the mouth, using a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch, rather than the high-pitched calls of mammals. The iconic \"Jurassic Park\" roar, created in a sound studio, was not based on actual dinosaur vocalizations but on a mix of animal noises like baby elephant cries and a gurgling alligator. The researchers found that closed-mouth sounds, like those of pigeons and doves, were more common in larger-bodied dinosaurs, suggesting they may have had similar vocal abilities. The lack of fossil evidence makes it difficult to determine the exact sounds dinosaurs made, but the study highlights the diversity of vocalizations among dinosaurs and the possibility that some may have resembled bird-like coos or hoots. The discovery challenges the common perception of dinosaur roars in films like \"Jurassic Park,\" which relied heavily on sound effects created in a studio.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

In a groundbreaking experiment, researchers were able to create a continuous, albeit blurry, representation of the subjects' thoughts by analyzing their brain patterns while they watched movie trailers. This breakthrough, known as \"mind reading\" or \"internal imagery reconstruction,\" suggests a potential for decoding dreams, memories, and even thoughts without visual cues.\n\nThe study involved subjects lying in an MRI machine, with their brain activity linked to specific visual elements in the videos. By matching patterns of neural activity to YouTube content, the researchers developed a computer model that could reconstruct the videos from the subjects' brain patterns. This represents a significant advancement from previous attempts, which mainly focused on reconstructing static images.\n\nThe technology has the potential to delve into the realm of mind-reading, particularly in understanding what happens within our minds without external visual stimulation. It could potentially reveal our thoughts and memories, as the researchers aim to understand the brain's processing of dynamic visual experiences. However, the technology is still in its early stages, and more complex models are needed to achieve clearer reconstructions.\n\nWhile the researchers are optimistic about the implications for understanding internal imagery and even transmitting such images, the application of this technology raises ethical concerns, particularly in regards to privacy and the possibility of accessing unfiltered memories. The technology could also be used for broadcasting imagery, potentially allowing paralyzed individuals to control their environment through imagined movements.\n\nIn summary, the research at UC Berkeley has taken a significant step forward in understanding the brain's capacity to interpret visual experiences, with the potential to unlock insights into dreams, memories, and even thoughts.

{"pred": "The news articles discuss the use of Bayesian statistics in the search for missing aircraft, specifically focusing on the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the Air France Flight 447. Bayesian methods, developed by statisticians, help refine and update search strategies in complex situations like underwater searches, where multiple factors like wind, ocean currents, and potential damage to the plane's communication devices influence the probability of finding the wreckage.\n\nIn the case of Flight 370, Bayesian analysis has been employed to update the search area based on new information, such as the possibility of a deliberate disappearance, which shifts the focus to specific points. The method involves calculating the probability of finding the plane at different latitudes and depths, considering the likelihood of a crash due to an accident versus a deliberate act.\n\nIn the Air France search, Bayesian techniques were used to analyze the probability of the plane's location, taking into account the likelihood of beacon malfunction and the possibility of damage to the black boxes. The approach, led by Metron Scientific Solutions, led to the successful discovery of the wreckage in the case of the Air France flight.\n\nHowever, the use of Bayesian statistics in the Malaysia Airlines search, involving the missing plane, faces challenges due to the complexity of the situation and the likelihood of a more dramatic change in the cause of the disappearance, which makes traditional Bayesian methods less suitable. Some experts argue that Bayesian rules might not be the best fit for the situation, as they can be adjusted to accommodate new information, unlike quick human intuition.\n\nDespite these complexities, Bayesian techniques provide a disciplined framework for integrating expert judgment, allowing search teams to adapt to changing circumstances. The Bayesian approach, while not infallible, offers a systematic way to weigh and update information as it becomes available, making it a valuable tool in the search for Flight 370.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayesian statistics, originally developed in the 18th century, continues to play a role in modern search operations, helping to refine and adapt search strategies in the face of complex mysteries like the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. While it may not guarantee a definitive answer, Bayesian methods offer a structured approach to analyzing and updating probability distributions in the hope of uncovering the missing aircraft.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

Fortunately, neither Altahan nor her passenger were injured in the incident.\n\nState Police reported that the car had been traveling on Route 4 in Mendon when the GPS system directed a quick turn, leading to Altahan's decision to follow the instruction. However, this action resulted in the car being stranded on the wire. A witness, who happened to be passing by, saw Altahan跳出 the vehicle as the emergency services arrived, including the State Police and the Rutland City Fire Department.\n\nThe situation was quickly resolved, with both law enforcement and fire personnel arriving at the scene. The car was eventually removed from the pole, and the incident serves as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of relying too heavily on GPS without considering real-time road conditions.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP. Police say 30-year-old Nabila Altahan of Dorchester, Mass., was headed west on US Route 4 when she passed her intended destination and reacted quickly to the instructions, leaving the road at a significant enough speed to propel the vehicle up the wires. She wasn't injured. (This driver followed her GPS into a lake.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 310}

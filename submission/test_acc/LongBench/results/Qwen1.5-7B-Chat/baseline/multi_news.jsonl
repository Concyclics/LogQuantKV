The research, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander at the University of California, San Diego, shows that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the virulence and resilience of MRSA.\n\nIn the first study, Crotty Alexander and her team found that cigarette smoke extract makes MRSA more resistant to the immune cells' defenses, such as reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides. This resistance allows the bacteria to adhere better to human cells and survive longer, making infections more difficult to treat. The study also noted that the resistance to smoke exposure persisted for 24 hours, suggesting it could be inherited by the bacteria.\n\nA second study, led by the same team, investigated the effects of e-cigarette vapor on MRSA and found that while it also contributed to increased resistance, the effect was less pronounced compared to cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke, in particular, seemed to have a stronger impact on MRSA's cell walls, altering its structure and enhancing its ability to evade host defenses.\n\nThese findings highlight the dual role of cigarette smoke: not only does it harm smokers by damaging their respiratory and immune systems, but it also aids in the survival and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The researchers hope that their work will contribute to public health campaigns emphasizing the importance of quitting smoking to reduce the risk of MRSA infections and the spread of antibiotic resistance.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

AFM affects the nervous system, causing paralysis in children and adults, with symptoms including muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and facial droop. The exact cause is unknown, but enteroviruses, particularly enterovirus D68, have been linked to the condition in the past. In 2014, a significant outbreak occurred, affecting 120 children, leading to concerns about a potential repeat.\n\nEnteroviruses, such as EV-D68, are common and usually cause mild illnesses, but when they enter the central nervous system, they can lead to more severe complications. There is no specific treatment for AFM, and recovery can be slow, with some patients experiencing long-term disabilities. Good hygiene practices, such as hand washing and staying up-to-date on vaccinations, are advised to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe CDC is urging healthcare providers to report suspected cases and is conducting investigations to determine the cause and potential risk factors. Parents and doctors are concerned about the lack of information and the potential recurrence of the disease. Some cases have been linked to enteroviruses, but the exact role of EV-D68 in the current rise is still uncertain.\n\nIn response to the increase, the CDC has issued health advisories and provided clinical management guidelines for affected individuals.

A study published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences analyzed the blood patterns on the cloth and found them to be inconsistent with those that could have been produced by a crucified body lying flat. Researchers, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used blood flow analysis on a live subject and a mannequin to simulate various positions, including standing and supine, to determine the blood flow patterns.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the blood stains on the shroud do not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion, with angles being off by up to 10 degrees. The researchers found that the bloodstains on the left hand, forearm, and \"lance wound\" in the torso are inconsistent with each other, suggesting a standing model was used to create the image. The study also noted that the simulated spear wound in the chest did not produce the same pattern as seen on the shroud, either when the victim was standing or lying down.\n\nWhile the bloodstain pattern analysis does not definitively prove the shroud to be a forgery, it casts doubt on its claimed historical authenticity. The Vatican, which regards the shroud as an icon, has not officially weighed in on its authenticity. The investigation has reignited the debate surrounding the shroud's origins and has sparked interest in using forensic techniques to further investigate its possible origins.\n\nIn summary, the forensic investigation of the Shroud of Turin's blood patterns suggests that the cloth may not be the actual burial cloth of Jesus, but rather a medieval representation.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

{"pred": "The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), the subject of Cheryl Strayed's best-selling memoir \"Wild\" and the recent movie adaptation, has experienced a surge in popularity due to the book and film. Strayed's story of self-discovery and healing through hiking has inspired many, leading to a 300% increase in website traffic for the Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) since December. The movie has not only raised awareness but also led to a small increase in inquiries about the trail and a significant rise in permit requests.\n\nThe PCT, stretching 2,650 miles across California, Oregon, and Washington, has traditionally seen only around 3,346 completed through-hikes since the 1950s. However, the number of hikers attempting the full journey has been on the rise, with 1,000 hikers attempting a through-hike in 2014. The increase in interest has led to concerns about overcrowding, particularly in the desert sections, where the PCTA implemented a permit system with a daily quota of 50 to spread the load and minimize environmental impact.\n\nThe movie has not only attracted novice hikers but has also contributed to a shift in the demographic, with anecdotal evidence suggesting a growing number of female hikers. The PCTA has launched a campaign, #responsiblywild, to promote safety and \"leave no trace\" principles among the increasing number of hikers.\n\nWhile the PCTA's permit system aims to manage the人流, there are concerns about the strain on resources, such as increased search and rescue operations, and the potential for overuse and degradation of the trail. The desire for a dispersed hiking experience is evident, but the honor system and the lack of a formalized sign-up system leaves room for issues to arise.\n\nIn conclusion, the Pacific Crest Trail's popularity, driven by the book and movie, has led to both a surge in interest and challenges related to overcrowding and environmental preservation.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

This crow-sized dinosaur, which lived during the Jurassic Period, has been named after the Mandarin word for rainbow due to its shimmering, rainbow-like colors. The fossil, with nearly complete preservation, reveals that Caihong had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, similar to those of hummingbirds. These feathers, made up of pancake-shaped melanosomes, may have served as a display feature, attracting mates and providing insulation.\n\nThe dinosaur, with a bird-like body and a Velociraptor-like skull, had a distinctive crest on its head and was a two-legged predator. Its feathers, despite being bird-like, are believed to have been insufficient for flight but could have played a role in communication or courtship. Caihong's feathers, with their unique arrangement and coloration, suggest a more colorful Jurassic world than previously thought.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature Communications, used advanced imaging techniques to analyze the fossil's nanostructures, which were found to be similar to melanosomes in modern birds, indicating the presence of pigmentation. The researchers propose that the iridescence was likely for display purposes, but the exact colors remain unknown.\n\nThis discovery challenges the traditional view of dinosaur feathers, as it is the oldest known creature with asymmetrical feathers, a trait used by birds for aerodynamic purposes. The fossil's combination of feather characteristics and its placement on the evolutionary tree suggests that iridescent coloration in small dinosaurs existed before the emergence of birds.\n\nOverall, Caihong juji provides valuable insights into the diversity and complexity of feathered dinosaurs and the evolution of iridescence in pre-bird animals.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial sugary drink tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding initiatives like free community college, has faced widespread opposition and negative consequences. The tax, which imposes a 1.75 cent per ounce charge on sweetened beverages, has led to a significant increase in prices, with a case of Gatorade doubling in cost. Retailers like Costco have responded by directing customers to purchase the product outside the city to avoid the tax, resulting in lost revenue for Seattle. The tax has been criticized for its lack of effectiveness in promoting health, driving revenue away, and being regressive, affecting low-income families more. The backlash against the tax has been strong, with groups like Bernie Sanders and libertarians opposing it, as well as businesses and labor unions. Cook County, Illinois recently repealed its own soda tax after a public outcry, highlighting the failure of similar measures in other cities. The tax's impact on local businesses, particularly in Seattle, has been negative, with some reporting decreased sales. A proposed statewide soda tax in Spokane, Washington, is also being reconsidered due to concerns about its potential impact on local businesses. The overall consensus is that these types of taxes, while intended to address health issues, often face public resistance and fail to achieve their intended goals.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The employee, Myrna Arias, claims the app violated her privacy and that her employer's actions were illegal.

Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says.

House Speaker John Boehner's Republican-led Congress has passed a bill to fund the government until December 15, but it includes conditions that include a one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and a repeal of the medical device tax. Senate Democrats, however, are refusing to accept any changes to the ACA, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto the bill.\n\nThe House's move to delay the ACA is driven by conservative pressure within the Republican conference, who see it as a chance to challenge the law. If the House accepts a spending bill without major changes to the ACA, it is unlikely to do so until the last minute, possibly necessitating a short government shutdown to satisfy conservative demands. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, is not expected to concur with the House's version until Monday afternoon, after the midnight deadline.\n\nThe Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, has adopted a hardline stance, urging the president not to negotiate with House Republicans and insisting on maintaining the ACA. This has led to a showdown between the two chambers, with Reid planning to kill the House's anti-ACA provisions in the Senate.\n\nIf the House refuses to pass a clean stopgap measure, a partial government shutdown will occur, marking the first time since the Clinton era. The potential shutdown would have significant economic consequences, with the Washington region, home to a large number of federal workers and contractors, projected to lose around $200 million per day and affect over 700,000 jobs. Local services, such as trash collection and library operations, could also be disrupted.\n\nBoth parties are blaming each other for the impending shutdown, with Republicans accusing Reid of seeking a political advantage and Democrats arguing that it is Boehner's responsibility to pass a funding bill without ACA provisions.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

In South Africa, a lion named Sylvester, who had escaped from Karoo National Park, was initially considered for relocation rather than killing due to public appeals, but ultimately, the decision was made to put him down to protect human safety.\n\nThese incidents have raised questions about the use of tranquilizers versus lethal force, with factors such as the animal's behavior, available resources, and the potential risk to humans weighing into the decision-making process. In both cases, local residents have sometimes interfered with wildlife officials, leading to conflicts.\n\nKenya's famous lion, Mohawk, a 13-year-old celebrity, was tragically killed by rangers after being cornered and attacking a boda boda rider. The killing was criticized for not attempting tranquilization, and locals expressed disappointment. The park's infrastructure, particularly the lack of a fully functioning electric fence, has contributed to the increasing number of stray lions in the area.\n\nThe escapes from Nairobi National Park, where Mohawk was born, have led to concerns about habitat loss and the impact of urbanization on wildlife. Conservationists blame the growth of the city for the lions' displacement, while the government is working on balancing resource management with infrastructure development.\n\nOverall, these incidents serve as a reminder of the complex challenges faced by wildlife conservation in the face of human encroachment and the need for better management strategies to protect both people and lions in their natural habitats.", "answers": ["An escaped lion, a taunting crowd, and an ill-prepared first-response team came together in Kenya to cause what some are saying was the unnecessary, senseless death of the lion, the country's Star reports.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

Markham claimed she did not want the baby to consume any animal products and instead used a soy-based formula from Whole Foods. She was arrested after police received a tip about the situation and found the baby in need of medical attention. The baby has since been placed in state custody and Markham is scheduled to appear in court in August for a hearing on the charges.\n\nIn the second story, a similar situation occurred in Orlando, Florida, where a mother, also named Sarah Markham (not related to the previous case), regained custody of her son Caleb after a court ruling. Caleb, who was less than 2 weeks old and had lost 10% of his body weight, was initially taken away from her by Seminole County Child Protective Services due to concerns about his health. Sarah argued that she was trying to provide a vegan diet for her son, but a doctor recommended hospitalization. The judge ruled in her favor, allowing her to keep Caleb on the condition that she provides a nutritionist's report within 10 days. Caleb's grandfather expressed relief and said the case was \"simply a doctor challenging a mother's choice.\"\n\nBoth cases highlight the complexities of parenting decisions, particularly when they conflict with medical advice, and the legal implications that can arise when these choices lead to allegations of neglect or child endangerment.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products.

A University of Michigan study found that one in every seven colorectal cancer patients is under 50, upending current guidelines that recommend screening at age 50. The \"symptomless cancer\" can present with subtle symptoms like anemia, changes in bowel habits, or dark blood in stool, often leading to delayed diagnosis.\n\nYounger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to have advanced stages at diagnosis, which are more dangerous, but they tend to survive longer without recurrence due to aggressive treatment. The study by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team, using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, revealed that younger patients undergoing distant metastasis were more likely to undergo surgery and receive radiation therapy compared to older ones.\n\nThe five-year survival rates for younger patients with localized, regional, and distant disease were higher than those for older patients, emphasizing the need for improved risk assessment and screening strategies for this age group. However, the study's limitations, including the lack of data on family history and selection bias, necessitate further investigation.\n\nA Reuters Health article reports that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and over one in ten colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50, prompting a call to action for the medical community. While some experts, like Dr. David Weinberg, caution against altering screening guidelines too early due to the lower likelihood of colorectal cancer in younger individuals, others argue that it's a wake-up call to consider earlier detection.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients, coupled with the need for tailored screening and treatment, underscores the need for continued research and updated guidelines to address this evolving health issue.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

In a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a site known as Warratyi was found to contain evidence of human occupation dating back to 49,000 years, with the use of sophisticated tools, bone fragments, and ochre. The discovery was made by Giles Hamm, a consultant archaeologist, and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard during a survey. The site's significance lies in its age and location, as it challenges the previously accepted timeline of human arrival in Australia.\n\nThe site's blackened roof, indicating fire-making, was a key indicator of human activity. The excavation recovered around 4,300 artifacts and 200 bone fragments from various mammals and reptiles, with some dating back to 49,000 years. These findings challenge the belief that humans migrated from the Levant to Australia with advanced technologies, suggesting a local, cultural evolution that produced these tools.\n\nThe presence of megafauna bones, particularly Diprotodon optatum, suggests coexistence and potential hunting by early humans. The use of ochre, the earliest known in Australia, was also dated to around the same period. The study, published in Nature, challenges the commonly held view that Indigenous Australians' material culture was less sophisticated.\n\nThe discovery at Warratyi underscores the ingenuity and adaptability of early humans in Australia, as they rapidly expanded from coastal regions into the arid interior.

{"pred": "The news articles cover various scientific discoveries and insights into human history and evolution. Here's a summary:\n\n1. In a study published in Science, researchers propose that dramatic climate shifts in East Africa around 320,000 years ago drove toolmaking advancements and the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their relatives. The discovery of new Middle Stone Age tools and red pigment from Olorgesailie Basin suggests a trend of climate-driven behavior changes, leading to increased foraging over larger areas and the use of faraway obsidian for tools, indicating long-distance contacts and potential trading.\n\n2. The oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, with spearpoints and other small stone implements, date back to 320,000 years ago, challenging previous estimates of 280,000 to 300,000 years. These tools show gradual downsizing, possibly reflecting adaptations to changing environmental conditions, and may have been used for hunting, resource acquisition, and possibly signaling social status.\n\n3. The Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya, where these tools were found, experienced frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions, which may have influenced the evolution of tool-making and social organization. The presence of obsidian from distant sources suggests the formation of trading networks among dispersed human populations, supporting the idea that social networking played a crucial role in the success of early Homo sapiens.\n\n4. The new findings challenge the traditional view that modern behaviors, such as symbolism and innovation, emerged only after Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa. Archaeological evidence from the Olorgesailie Basin, dating back to 320,000 years, indicates that some of these behaviors occurred much earlier, possibly in response to environmental changes, and suggest the presence of technologically advanced hominin groups.\n\n5. The transition from the Acheulean culture to the Middle Stone Age in the region is marked by the appearance of smaller, standardized stone tools, which were made with exotic materials like obsidian and red ochre. This evidence points to the existence of expanded social networks, information sharing, and technological innovation among these early humans.\n\nIn summary, these discoveries reveal a more complex and dynamic picture of human evolution, with advanced tool-making and social interactions occurring earlier than previously thought, challenging the notion of a single \"human revolution\" and suggesting a more gradual and regional development of modern behaviors.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water.

The decision annuls the protected status of the KitKat shape within the European Union, allowing for similar products like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj to remain unchallenged and potentially allowing supermarkets to sell own-brand imitations.

Nestlé plans to appeal the decision, but experts suggest the EU Intellectual Property Office may reconsider the trademark based on the new evidence.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long associated with the iconic roar heard in movies like \"Jurassic Park,\" may not have sounded like the terrifying beasts we imagine. A recent study published in the journal Evolution suggests that the roar of T. rex and other dinosaurs was likely a combination of fictional sound effects, created in a sound studio, rather than based on fossil evidence. The actual sounds of dinosaurs, the researchers propose, could have resembled the cooing of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich, with closed-mouth vocalizations that are low-pitched and produced through a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch.\n\nThe study challenges the common perception of dinosaur vocalizations, which have often been portrayed as high-pitched and mammalian-like. Instead, these sounds, called \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" are more akin to those of birds, with a whooshing, throaty quality. The researchers found that large-bodied dinosaurs, such as doves and ostriches, may have had similar vocal abilities due to the presence of this trait.\n\nThe lack of fossil evidence for dinosaur vocal cords and the discovery of closed-mouth behavior in multiple animal lineages, including birds and crocodiles, supports the idea that this vocal trait evolved independently. Some dinosaurs, particularly those with large body sizes, may have used closed-mouth vocalizations for mating displays or territorial defense.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on \"Jurassic Park,\" shared that he created the raptor and T. rex sounds by blending animal noises, including horse breathing for the raptors and a goose's hissing for the aggressive ones. The study's findings emphasize the importance of understanding the vocal capabilities of living birds to better comprehend the sounds of their extinct dinosaur relatives.\n\nIn conclusion, the latest research challenges our preconceived notions of dinosaur vocalizations, revealing a more nuanced and bird-like reality. While the exact sounds of these ancient creatures remain uncertain, the study provides valuable insights into the evolution of vocal behavior in birds and the potential for similar traits in non-avian dinosaurs.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

The report includes a timeline that contrasts the public statements made by officials with private communications that revealed a different story.\n\n3. Representative Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo, both Republicans, signed onto the official majority document and authored an additional 51-page report that supports the committee's findings of a deliberate deception by the administration.\n\n4. The report highlights the inconsistencies between public statements made by Secretary Clinton and private conversations, where she acknowledged the attack was a terrorist act, not a protest linked to a video.\n\n5. The State Department was concerned about the potential impact of Marines wearing uniforms on diplomacy during the attack, but the military never deployed to Benghazi.\n\n6. The clothing issue, whether Marines should wear uniforms or civilian clothing, was raised during the emergency conference call but was not found to have affected the military response's speed or timeliness.\n\n7.

The first was 8-year-old Martin Richard, and his father, Bill, released a statement today thanking supporters and asking for privacy, reports WBZ. \"My dear son Martin has died from injuries sustained in the attack on Boston. My wife and daughter are both recovering from serious injuries. We thank our family and friends, those we know and those we have never met, for their thoughts and prayers.

{"pred": "The world is grappling with a significant obesity crisis, affecting both developed and developing countries, according to a pair of recent studies. The United States leads the global obesity rate with 13% of its population being obese, despite having only 5% of the world's population. However, the problem is not unique to the US, as obesity rates are on the rise in many other countries, including those in the Middle East, Central America, and Pacific Islands.\n\nThe Lancet medical journal published a comprehensive study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which reveals that obesity has increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013, representing almost 30% of the global population. This growth is not evenly distributed, with some countries experiencing extraordinary obesity rates, such as 50% among men in Tonga and women in Kuwait.\n\nThe study highlights that obesity is a multi-faceted issue influenced by factors like increased calorie intake, changes in diet, reduced physical activity, and shifts in gut bacteria. The rise in obesity is linked to the accessibility and affordability of unhealthy, processed foods, particularly in developing countries where income gains have coincided with population-wide weight gains.\n\nIn the United States, while obesity rates have slowed among adults, they continue to accelerate among children. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to address the rising obesity among children globally, with a report expected in early 2015.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that obesity is a major health concern, contributing to numerous chronic diseases and leading to millions of deaths annually. They note that the burden of obesity is not limited to wealthy nations, as developing countries are also witnessing significant increases.\n\nOverall, the news underscores the urgent need for global efforts to tackle obesity through public health interventions, promoting healthier diets, encouraging physical activity, and addressing the environmental factors that contribute to the rise in obesity rates.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns. The 188-country study found that there are 2.1 billion overweight or obese people in the world, making up around 30% of the world's population, up from 20% in 1980, USA Today reports. Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

Islamists are expected to consolidate their gains, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party leading, followed by the Nour party representing Salafi Muslims. The election comes amidst trials for Mubarak, who is accused of tyranny and violence, and growing opposition to the ruling generals. The outcome of the elections is uncertain, as the military council has not yet announced the seat allocation formula. Economic growth has slowed due to the unrest, and clashes between protesters and security forces have persisted. The trial of Mubarak, who has pleaded not guilty, continues, with the prosecution aiming for a harsh punishment. The new parliament, set to convene in January, will face political struggles among the military, Brotherhood, Salafis, and revolutionary forces, with the Brotherhood considering forming a coalition to avoid a single-party government.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house.

Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party.

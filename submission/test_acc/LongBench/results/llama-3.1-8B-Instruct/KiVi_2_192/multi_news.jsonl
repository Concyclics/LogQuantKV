The policy allows the company to collect voice data, including voice commands, and transmit it to third-party services.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax.

The app, Xora, was required by her employer to track her every move, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Arias, a sales executive, claimed that the app was an invasion of her privacy and likened it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet. \n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias was a high-performing employee, earning $7,250 per month, and had met all her job quotas. However, she was fired after she expressed her concerns about the app's GPS function tracking her location during non-work hours. Her employer, John Stubits, admitted that employees would be monitored while off-duty and that she was being tracked, and that her location was being monitored, even when she was off-duty. \n\nArius' lawsuit claims that her employer, Intermex, retaliated against her for her objections to the tracking app, leading to her wrongful termination. The lawsuit also alleges that her employer interfered with her ability to find new employment, as she was fired from her previous job at NetSpend due to her employer's actions.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $500,000 and claims that Intermex's actions were an invasion of her privacy, retaliation, and unfair business practices.

Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called. Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says.

Here are five notable individuals who have experienced a significant loss in their public standing.\n\n**1. Anthony Scaramucci**\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the former White House Communications Director, is one of the most recent examples of a high-profile figure who fell from power. Fired in July 2017, just 10 days after his appointment, Scaramucci's tenure was marked by controversy, including protocol breaches and public feuds with other officials. His short-lived stint in the White House was also marred by a divorce filing by his wife, which added to his public woes.\n\n**2. Chris Christie**\n\nGovernor of New Jersey and a contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, Chris Christie's reputation took a hit after the Bridgegate scandal, where he was involved in a traffic jam controversy. Christie's reputation took another hit when he was replaced by Donald Trump as his transition team's head, and he was eventually replaced by Mike Pence as the head of the transition team. Christie's approval ratings plummeted, and his reputation was further damaged by the Bridgegate scandal.\n\n**3. James Comey**\n\nJames Comey, the former Director of the FBI, was fired by President Donald Trump in 2017, after a tumultuous tenure marked by public feuds and controversies.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

According to the study, nearly 15% of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer are under 50, which is a significant increase from previous estimates. This trend raises questions about the current guidelines for screening and treatment of colorectal cancer.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that younger patients (under 50) were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer, including tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. However, despite having more aggressive cancer, younger patients tended to live longer without a recurrence of cancer after treatment.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, notes that the reasons for this trend are unclear, but it may be linked to environmental factors, poor diet, smoking, and other lifestyle choices. \"It's a wake-up call for the medical community to be more vigilant in diagnosing and treating colorectal cancer in younger people,\" Dr. Hendren said. \"We need to start looking for signs of colorectal cancer in people under 50.\"\n\nThe study's findings suggest that younger patients are more likely to have a higher five-year survival rate compared to older patients. For instance, patients under 50 had a 95% five-year survival rate for localized disease, 76% for patients with advanced cancer, and 21% for patients with cancer that had spread to other organs.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Hendren, emphasizes that the findings are not a call to change the current guidelines for screening, but rather a wake-up call for the medical community to be more vigilant in diagnosing and treating colorectal cancer in younger people. \"We need to optimize our risk assessment and screening for people under 50,\" she said. \"We need to be more proactive in diagnosing and treating colorectal cancer in young people.\"\n\nHowever, some experts note that the study's findings may be influenced by selection bias and that the benefits of screening younger people may be overestimated. \"It's too early to say whether screening should start at an earlier age,\" said Dr. David Weinberg, a cancer expert at the Fox Chase Cancer Center.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked a call to action for the medical community to be more vigilant in diagnosing and treating colore", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to the presence of dark energy, a mysterious force that causes the universe to expand. This expansion will eventually lead to the stars beyond our galaxy becoming inaccessible, and a civilization must act quickly to capture stars from other galaxies before they become unattainable.\n\nTo achieve this, a civilization would need to create a network of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to collect energy from stars.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

However, critics argue that this move is a step backwards in audio technology.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has been met with ridicule on Twitter, with many users calling it \"arrogant\" and \"stupid.\" Critics argue that the decision is driven by Apple's desire to sell more expensive and proprietary accessories, such as the $159 AirPods. The AirPods, which use wireless technology, have been criticized for their poor sound quality and ease of loss.\n\nPhil Schiller's justification for the removal of the headphone jack has been widely mocked, with many pointing out that it's not a courageous move, but rather a move driven by Apple's desire to sell more expensive accessories. Critics argue that the decision is driven by greed and a desire to control the market.\n\nThe second most nonsensical statement made by Schiller is that the iPhone 7's design is at a premium, with the company wanting to use the space for other features like Taptic engines. Critics argue that this is a weak excuse, as many iPhone users are unaware of what Taptic engines are.\n\nThe decision to remove the headphone jack has also led to the demise of other devices that plug into the iPhone's headphone jack, including Square's credit card dongle, temperature sensors, and other devices. Critics argue that this move is a step back in innovation and a step forward for Apple's profits.\n\nThe old Apple mantra of \"it just works\" is now dead, as users are forced to use expensive and unwieldy accessories to listen to music. The decision to remove the headphone jack has sparked a large amount of pure rage among users.", "answers": ["Apple presented its new smartphone Wednesday, and nestled in with the iPhone 7's much-ballyhooed features was the disclosure that the company is getting rid of the phone's headphone jack—news that wasn't exactly met with universal acclaim, or much acclaim at all. Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

The procedure, carried out at Great Ormond Street Hospital, involved creating two new ears from cartilage taken from Kieran's ribs. The surgical team, led by Neil Bulstrode, a consultant plastic surgeon, used a combination of previous operations and a hearing aid to help Kieran hear. \n\nKieran, from Hertfordshire, was born with a rare condition called bilateral microtia, where he had small lobes instead of ears. He was also deaf, but thanks to several previous operations and a hearing aid, he can now hear. However, he still had a significant cosmetic issue, which the surgery aimed to address.\n\nThe procedure, which took six hours to complete, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into the shape of his ears. The new ears were then grafted onto his head, using skin from his rib cartilage. The surgical team used a template of his mother's ears to shape the new ears. The procedure was primarily cosmetic, aiming to improve Kieran's self-esteem and confidence.\n\nKieran's parents, Louise and David Sorkin, were overjoyed with the result, saying it was a huge boost for their son's confidence. Kieran himself was thrilled with his new ears, saying he felt like he could finally \"be like everyone else.\" The family hopes that the new ears will boost Kieran's confidence and help him fit in better at school.\n\nThe procedure is a significant step forward in treating children with microtia, a condition that affects one in 100,000 children. The surgical team at Great Ormond Street Hospital performs about 40 such operations a year, mostly to create one ear. The new procedure is a significant step forward in treating children with microtia, with the potential for future advancements in the field.\n\nIn the future, scientists at the Institute of Child Health are working on creating new ears from stem cells, which could be a less invasive procedure. However, for now, the current method of using cartilage from the ribs is the most effective way to create new ears.\n\nKieran will need a follow-up operation in six months to make his ears stand out from his scalp. The family is optimistic that the new ears will last for a long time.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage.

They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

The company has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that all wood imports complied with US and Malagasy law. However, the government has filed a court motion stating that the wood was imported from Madagascar, which is a country with a history of deforestation.\n\nThe Lacey Act has been amended to cover the trade in endangered species, including plants and trees.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

The report, which was released on Tuesday, provides new details on the attack and the Obama administration's response to it. \n\nThe report reveals that the administration knew the attack was a terrorist attack from the beginning, but they led the public to believe it was a protest sparked by an anti-Islamic video. The report also criticizes former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other officials for not adequately addressing the growing extremism in Libya.\n\nThe report highlights the contradictions between the public and private statements made by the administration. For example, Secretary Clinton's public statement on September 11, 2012, blamed the attack on a video, while private statements and emails showed that officials knew it was a terrorist attack. The report also reveals that the administration's public statements were inconsistent with the private statements made by officials, including Secretary Clinton, who knew the attack was a terrorist attack from the beginning.\n\nThe report also reveals that the administration's public statements were not based on the best available intelligence. The report states that the administration's public statements were based on a false narrative that the attack was a protest over an anti-Islamic video. The report also reveals that the administration's public statements were not based on the best available intelligence, but rather on a narrative that was not supported by evidence.\n\nThe report also criticizes the administration's handling of the attack, stating that they did not adequately address the growing extremism in Libya. The report also accuses the administration of ignoring the evidence of a terrorist attack and instead blaming it on a video.\n\nThe report's findings have been met with criticism from Democrats, including Rep. Elijah Cummings, who called the report a \"sad exercise\" and accused the GOP of trying to prevent accountability.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3608}

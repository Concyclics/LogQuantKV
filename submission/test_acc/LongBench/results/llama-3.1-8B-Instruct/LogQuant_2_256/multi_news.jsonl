Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have discovered that cigarette smoke can alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is further exacerbated by the fact that cigarette smoke can also make MRSA more aggressive, allowing it to invade human cells more easily.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at the University of California, San Diego, cigarette smoke acts as an alarm to the bacteria, triggering a stress response that makes it more resistant to the immune system. This resistance is not limited to the bacteria's cell walls; it also makes them more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are used by the immune system to kill bacteria.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was four times more resistant to the immune system than non-exposed MRSA. Furthermore, the smoke-exposed bacteria were also more likely to invade human cells and cause disease. The study suggests that cigarette smoke can make MRSA more resistant to the immune system, making it more difficult to treat.\n\nA similar study conducted by the same researchers found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and more likely to invade human cells.

The study, which used a method borrowed from Google's PageRank algorithm, initially found that Frank Sinatra was the most influential person in the world, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, this result was skewed by the fact that the algorithm was heavily influenced by the large number of species and organisms named after Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist who developed the system of taxonomy that is still widely used today.\n\nTo correct for this bias, the researchers used a second method called CheiRank, which measures the number of outgoing links from a page. This led to a new ranking, with Carl Linnaeus emerging as the most influential thinker in the world. The study found that Linnaeus' influence is due to the fact that his system of taxonomy is used in the naming of many species across different languages and cultures.\n\nThe study also found that the most influential people in the world are often those who have had a lasting impact on their respective fields.

When Forbes told Ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, Ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about—in the amount of \"more than $2 billion,\" assets Ross said he put into the trusts sometime \"between the election and [my] nomination.\" When Forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, Ross cited \"privacy issues\"—and the magazine lays out other problems with Ross' story on the supposed $2 billion transfer.

The investigator, Eusebio Felix, claimed that the gang, known as the \"Pishtacos,\" had murdered up to 60 people and sold their fat to the cosmetics industry for thousands of dollars a liter. However, it appears that the entire story was fabricated.\n\nThe investigation, which was initially presented as a major breakthrough, was based on a legend from Peruvian folklore about the Pishtacos, mythical killers who roam the Andes mountains extracting fat from their victims. However, it has now been revealed that the story was used to explain a series of murders that were actually linked to the cocaine trade.\n\nThe investigation was marred by a series of inconsistencies, including the claim that the fat was sold to the cosmetics industry, which medical experts say is not possible due to the spoilage of fat.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

However, the tax has been deemed regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and driving sales to neighboring cities and counties.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed in December 2018 after a public outcry and a significant decline in sales. The tax added a penny per ounce to sugary drinks and was seen as a burden on low-income families. The tax also led to a decline in sales of sugary drinks, but not a reduction in consumption. Instead, people simply bought their drinks in neighboring counties, depriving the city of revenue.\n\nIn Seattle, the tax has led to a significant increase in prices for sugary drinks, with a case of Gatorade going from $15.99 to $26.33. Retailers like Costco have taken steps to inform customers of the tax, posting signs directing them to nearby locations outside the city where they can buy the same products without the tax. The tax has also led to a decline in sales for retailers, with some businesses seeing a 34% decline in sales of sugary drinks.\n\nThe tax has been criticized for being regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families, and for not addressing the root causes of health issues. Some argue that the tax should be applied to all sugary drinks, not just those with milk as the primary ingredient.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

The study analyzed data from over 64,000 children in the Danish National Birth Cohort study and found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen were more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD and other related disorders.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Beate Ritz, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, emphasized that the findings do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Researchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 (15%) of them were under 50. This is a stark contrast to the current guidelines, which recommend starting colon cancer screenings at age 50.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, found that younger patients with colorectal cancer were more likely to have advanced disease, but they also lived longer without a recurrence after treatment. Younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) compared to older patients. The five-year survival rates for patients under 50 were higher than those over 50, with 95% of patients under 50 surviving without a recurrence, compared to 92% of patients over 50.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the increasing trend of colorectal cancer in younger adults may be due to various factors, including environmental influences, poor diet, and lifestyle choices. However, the exact reasons for this trend are still unknown. The study's findings are a wake-up call for the medical community to be more vigilant in screening for colorectal cancer in younger adults.\n\nExperts note that younger patients with colorectal cancer often have advanced disease, but they tend to live longer without a recurrence. Dr. David Hendren emphasizes the importance of early detection and treatment, saying that doctors should be on the lookout for symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel movements, and pain. Dr. David Weinberg notes that the study's findings are not conclusive and that more research is needed to determine whether screening should be expanded to younger age groups.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, believes that the findings are a wake-up call for the medical community to be more aware of the trend of colorectal cancer in younger adults.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The three stages of galactic expansion, or \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations, are:\n\n1. **Type I**: Harnessing all the resources of a planet (Earth's current level).\n2. **Type II**: Harnessing all the energy of a star (a step that humans may reach in a few thousand years).\n3. **Type III**: Harnessing all the resources of a galaxy (a stage that may be reached in a few hundred thousand to a million years).\n\nTo achieve this, a civilization would need to create a network of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to collect and harness the energy of a star. This concept was first proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1960 and later explored in science fiction. The idea is to create a cloud of satellites that would surround the star, collecting its energy and radiating it back to the planet.\n\nHowever, a new twist on this concept has been proposed by Dan Hooper, a scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. According to Hooper, a civilization would need to harvest energy from other stars in the universe before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe. This is because the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and stars beyond a certain distance will eventually be beyond our reach.\n\nTo achieve this, a civilization would need to create a network of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to collect and harness the energy of a star. This would require a large amount of energy, but it would also allow the civilization to expand its resources and become a universal power.\n\nThe paper suggests that a civilization would need to collect stars with masses of about 20-100 times that of our sun to be viable. This would require a large amount of energy, but it would also allow the civilization to harness the energy of the star.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres has been explored in science fiction and science, including in the works of Olaf Stapledon and Freeman Dyson. The idea of a civilization harvesting energy from a star has been explored in science fiction, including in the novel \"Star Maker\" by Olaf Stapledon and in the TV show \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\"\n\n**Detection of Alien Life**\n\nTo detect alien civilizations, astronomers would need to look", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "Recent discoveries in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin have shed new light on the evolution of early human behavior and toolmaking. A team of researchers, led by paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, has found evidence of dramatic changes in the climate and environment of the region, which may have driven early humans to adapt and innovate. The team discovered three new papers published in the journal Science, which suggest that early humans in the region made significant advancements in toolmaking and trading networks around 320,000 years ago.\n\nThe researchers found that the oldest tools, dating back to 320,000 years ago, were made from obsidian, a volcanic glass, which was transported from 25-50 kilometers away. This suggests that early humans were able to travel long distances and exchange goods, including tools and pigments, with other groups. The team also found evidence of the use of brightly colored rocks, which may have been used for symbolic purposes.\n\nThe findings suggest that early humans in the region were able to adapt to changing environments and develop new technologies to cope with the challenges. The researchers propose that the climate-driven changes in the region may have led to the development of more complex social networks and the exchange of goods and ideas.\n\nThe discovery of the Middle Stone Age tools in the Olorgesailie Basin has also led to a reevaluation of the concept of the \"human revolution,\" which was previously thought to have occurred around 50,000 years ago.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The company's decision to eliminate the standard 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of a proprietary Lightning cable has been met with ridicule and outrage. Apple's marketing chief, Phil Schiller, attempted to justify the move by citing \"courage\" as the reason behind the change. However, critics argue that this is a misguided decision that prioritizes Apple's own interests over user convenience.\n\n**The Argument Against the Change**\n\nCritics argue that the elimination of the headphone jack is a step backward in innovation. The standard 3.5mm connector has been the most widely used and successful audio standard in the world, and its removal will force users to purchase expensive and unwieldy adapters or Apple's proprietary AirPods. The AirPods, which are designed to work seamlessly with Apple devices, come with a hefty price tag of $159.\n\n**The Technological Excuse Falls Flat**\n\nApple's argument that the elimination of the headphone jack is due to \"space constraints\" has been met with skepticism. Critics argue that there is no technological reason to eliminate the standard jack, and that the sound quality of wireless headphones is inferior to that of wired headphones. The company's decision to prioritize its own proprietary technology over user convenience has been seen as a step backward in innovation.\n\n**The Impact on Users**\n\nThe elimination of the headphone jack will have a significant impact on users who rely on their iPhones for music and other audio applications. Users will now be forced to purchase expensive adapters or use inferior wireless headphones. The lack of a standard headphone jack will also affect third-party devices that rely on the 3.5mm connector, such as credit card readers, temperature sensors, and other devices.\n\n**The \"Courage\" Argument Falls Flat**\n\nPhil Schiller's argument that the elimination of the headphone jack is an example of \"courage\" has been met with ridicule on social media. Critics argue that courage involves doing something that makes you afraid, not eliminating a widely used standard in favor of a proprietary technology.\n\n**The \"Walled Garden\"**\n\nApple's decision to eliminate the headphone jack is seen as a step towards creating a \"walled garden\" of proprietary technology.

{"pred": "**Jamaica Decriminalizes Small-Scale Marijuana Possession and Establishes Medical Cannabis Industry**\n\nJamaica has made a significant step towards decriminalizing small-scale marijuana possession and establishing a medical cannabis industry. The island's parliament has passed a law that makes possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) of marijuana a petty offense, punishable by a fine rather than a criminal record. The new law also allows for the cultivation of up to five plants on private premises for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe move is seen as a major victory for Jamaican officials who have been pushing for relaxation of marijuana laws for decades. The law aims to correct decades of \"elephantine\" delays in passing the legislation, which has been in the works since 1985. The new law will also pave the way for the development of a medical cannabis industry, health tourism, and the creation of innovative products derived from marijuana.\n\nThe new law will benefit Jamaican citizens, particularly Rastafarians, who have long been allowed to use marijuana for spiritual purposes. The law also allows tourists to apply for permits to buy small amounts of Jamaican \"ganja\" for medical purposes. However, the government has emphasized that the law does not create a \"free-for-all\" in the cultivation and export of marijuana, and that the country will continue to enforce international treaties and combat transnational drug trafficking.\n\nThe move follows a trend of relaxation of marijuana laws in other countries. In the United States, over 20 states have decriminalized marijuana for medical use, and several countries, including Uruguay and Argentina, have also relaxed their laws. Jamaica's move is seen as a significant step towards becoming a player in the medical cannabis industry, which is expected to bring in revenue and create jobs.\n\nThe new law will also benefit local businesses, including those that have developed marijuana-derived products, such as \"Canasol,\" which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients. The Jamaican government hopes to capitalize on the growing demand for medical marijuana and health tourism, which could bring in significant revenue for the country.\n\nKey points of the new law include:\n\n- Possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) of marijuana is a petty offense, punishable by a fine.\n- The cultivation of up to five plants on private premises is allowed for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.\n- Rastafarians can use marijuana for spiritual purposes.\n- Tourists can apply for permits to buy Jamaican marijuana for medical purposes.\n", "answers": ["Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself.

The company's troubles began when federal marshals raided its Nashville and Memphis facilities, seizing wood and shutting down production. This is not the first time Gibson has faced scrutiny; a similar raid occurred in 2009, when the company was accused of importing ebony from Madagascar.\n\nThe Lacey Act, amended in 2008 to include plants, requires companies to ensure that the wood they use is sourced legally. However, Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims that the company has been unfairly targeted and that the law is too burdensome. The company maintains that it has complied with the law, but the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has concluded that Gibson knowingly imported wood from Madagascar, which has been banned due to concerns over deforestation.\n\nThe EIA's director, Andrea Johnson, says that Gibson's actions demonstrate a lack of compliance with the law, which requires companies to ensure that their wood supply chain is legitimate. Gibson has denied these allegations, stating that it has followed all relevant laws and regulations. The company's lawyer claims that the seized wood was sourced from India, not Madagascar.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also raised concerns among the music industry, with some guitar makers and dealers worried about the law's retroactive nature. The law requires companies to prove the origin of wood used in their instruments, even if they were built decades ago. This has led to a decrease in the sale of old instruments, as buyers are hesitant to purchase items that may contain wood from endangered species.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also led to a shift in the music industry, with some companies opting to use alternative materials or sourcing wood from countries with more stringent regulations. The EIA's Andrea Johnson believes that the law is necessary to prevent the destruction of endangered species and to promote responsible sourcing practices. However, the Gibson Guitar Company's case highlights the complexities and challenges of enforcing this law.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- The Lacey Act, amended in 2008, regulates the trade of endangered species, including plants and animals.\n- Gibson Guitar Company has been raided twice by the Lacey Act enforcement, with the most recent raid occurring in 2011.\n- The company denies allegations of sourcing wood from endangered species,", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

This finding contradicts previous theories that Mars' water was only present in short, isolated events.\n\n**Water Loss and Deuterium Enrichment**\n\nThe studies, led by NASA scientists, used infrared telescopes to analyze the Martian atmosphere and found that the planet has lost a significant amount of water over time. The loss of water has led to a higher concentration of deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen) in the Martian atmosphere, with a ratio of 7 times higher than Earth's. This suggests that Mars lost a substantial amount of water, equivalent to six times the current amount of water in the Martian ice caps.\n\n**Ancient Mars: A Vast Ocean**\n\nThe ancient ocean, which covered nearly half of the Martian surface, was at least 137 meters deep and covered nearly 20% of the planet's surface.

The water was lost due to the planet's weak gravity, which allowed the ordinary hydrogen to escape into space.\n\n**Implications for Life on Mars**\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean has significant implications for the search for life on Mars. Scientists believe that the longer water persisted on the Martian surface, the more likely it is that life could have emerged. The longer water was present, the more habitable the environment would have been. The study suggests that Mars was once a more hospitable place for life to emerge.\n\n**Ancient Mars: A Wet and Habitable World**\n\nThe ancient Martian environment was likely warm and wet, with an ocean covering nearly half of the surface.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

By using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer algorithms, they were able to reconstruct YouTube videos from brain activity patterns recorded while subjects watched the videos. This achievement marks a significant step towards understanding how the brain processes visual information and may lead to the development of a technology that can decode brain activity into visual images.\n\nThe study involved researchers from the university's neuroscience lab, who watched YouTube videos while inside an MRI machine. The brain activity patterns were then matched with images and sounds from the videos, creating a continuous, abstract representation of the visual experience. This technology has the potential to unlock the secrets of the brain's visual processing system, allowing scientists to understand how the brain interprets visual information and how it processes dynamic visual experiences.\n\nThe study's lead author, Shinji Nishimoto, said that this technology could pave the way for understanding how the brain works in natural conditions, including processing visual information, memories, and even dreams. The researchers believe that this technology could be used to broadcast imagery from the brain, such as dreams, memories, and even intentions.\n\nThe study's co-author, Jack Gallant, said that the brain activity measured in this study is just a fraction of the activity that lets us see moving images. He believes that more complex areas of the brain, such as those that help us distinguish faces from lifeless objects, need to be studied to improve the technology.\n\nThe researchers are now working on analyzing more brain areas to improve the resolution of the technology. They are also exploring the potential of using this technology to decode brain activity into visual images, which could have significant implications for people with paralyzing conditions, such as Lou Gehrig's disease. The technology could also be used to broadcast brain activity, potentially allowing people to control their environment by imagining movements.\n\nWhile the idea of decoding brain activity may seem like science fiction, the researchers say that it's a significant step towards understanding the brain's inner workings. However, the potential of this technology is still in its infancy, and more research is needed to unlock its full potential.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

The DNC learned of the attempt on Tuesday, CNN reports. The attack, which was detected by a cloud service provider and a security research company, involved a fake login page intended to gather usernames and passwords for a service called Votebuilder, which hosts the DNC's voter database. It's a method called \"spearphishing,\" according to the New York Times. \"It was very convincing,\" Mike Murray of the cybersecurity firm Lookout tells CNN, adding that it would be tough to tell the real page from the fake one, even if they were side-by-side. The fake login page was ultimately removed by the cloud hosting company DigitalOcean. The company's chief security officer says the threat was identified before the attack was launched. \"We see no evidence that any sensitive data was stolen,\" he says. A DNC official tells the Times that it is not clear who the hackers were in this case. But, the paper recalls, a 2016 hack of the DNC was ultimately traced to Russia. This latest attempt, DNC Chief Security Officer Bob Lord tells the Times, \"is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks.\" Earlier this week, Microsoft reported that it had uncovered new Russian hacking attempts targeting conservative organizations in the US."], "all_classes": null, "length": 716}

The research, led by Dr. Laura E.

The bacteria's cell walls were altered, making it harder for the immune system to eliminate them. This resistance persisted for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. When these smoke-exposed MRSA were introduced to mice, they caused significantly higher mortality and were more efficient at invading human cells in lab cultures.\n\nA similar study, led by Dr. Crotty Alexander and published earlier, investigated the effects of e-cigarette vapor on MRSA resistance. It showed that while e-cigarette smoke also altered the bacteria's cell walls, the effect was less pronounced compared to cigarette smoke.

The settlement provides each cheerleader with $2,500 per season, with additional payments for those involved in photo shoots at $400 per shoot.\n\nThe settlement comes after a five-year legal battle, with the cheerleaders, known as the Flight Crew, initially filing a class-action lawsuit in 2014.

AFM affects the nervous system, causing muscle weakness, and its exact cause is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections like enteroviruses and adenoviruses. The disease typically affects children, with the average age being 7, and can lead to severe complications like respiratory failure requiring ventilator support.\n\nIn 2014, AFM cases surged to 120, mostly affecting children under 21, and were linked to an outbreak of enterovirus D68. However, the CDC did not detect the virus in AFM specimens from that year, and limited cases of the virus were detected in 2015 and 2016. Enteroviruses are common and usually cause mild illnesses, but when they enter the central nervous system, they can cause more serious conditions.\n\nThe best prevention advice from the CDC includes regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and cleaning surfaces. There is currently no specific treatment for AFM, and recovery can be slow, with some patients showing partial improvement after a year.\n\nParents and healthcare providers are advised to be vigilant and report any sudden onset of muscle weakness to doctors, as early detection is crucial.

A study published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences has found inconsistencies in the blood patterns on the cloth, suggesting they cannot be explained by a body lying flat, as traditionally proposed. The researchers, forensic anthropologist Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and chemist Luigi Garlaschelli, used blood flow analysis on a live subject and a mannequin to simulate various positions, comparing them to the shroud's images.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the bloodstains on the cloth are inconsistent with the positions depicted, particularly in the hand and forearm patterns. For instance, the hand marks match an arm held at 45 degrees, while the forearm rivulets suggest an angle closer to 90 degrees, which is not consistent with the traditional crucifixion posture. The researchers also noted discrepancies in the simulated spear wound, which did not form a solid stain as seen on the shroud.\n\nThese findings, if true, cast doubt on the shroud's claim to be the actual burial cloth of Jesus. While the Vatican regards it as an icon, the lack of consistent blood patterns supports the idea that the shroud might be a medieval forgery. The investigation, however, does not rule out the possibility of multiple episodes of bleeding or other factors that could have affected the blood patterns.\n\nThe study's implications have sparked renewed interest in the scientific community, with some calling for further examination of the shroud's origins and methods of creation.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

{"pred": "The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), made famous by Cheryl Strayed's memoir \"Wild\" and the subsequent movie, has seen a surge in hikers due to the increased interest in the trail. The PCT Association reports a 300% increase in website traffic after the book and movie, leading to more inquiries about the trail and permit requests. The number of thru-hikers attempting the entire 2,650-mile route has risen each year, with the association estimating around 3,346 people having completed the hike since the 1950s, and this number is expected to continue to grow.\n\nCheryl Strayed's personal story of self-discovery and recovery through hiking the PCT has resonated with many, inspiring others to embark on the challenging journey. However, this surge in hikers has led to concerns about overcrowding and its impact on the trail and the environment. The Pacific Crest Trail Association implemented a permit system with a daily quota of 50 permits to spread the hiker load and prevent overuse, particularly in fragile desert environments.\n\nEnvironmental impacts include degradation of vegetation, increased human waste, and the need for more rescue operations. The PCTA is monitoring the situation and adjusting as needed. While some hikers are concerned about losing the trail's solitude, the PCT's openness and spirit of adventure remain a key draw.\n\nThe PCTA has also launched a campaign, #responsiblywild, to promote safety and \"leave no trace\" principles among hikers. This includes urging hikers to protect water quality, pack out trash, and build safe campfires. The association is aware that managing the growing number of hikers is a delicate balance and aims to preserve the trail's integrity while still allowing everyone to experience its transformative power.\n\nIn conclusion, the popularity of the PCT has both positive and negative consequences. While more people are discovering the trail and its therapeutic effects, the increasing numbers raise concerns about overcrowding and the need for responsible hiking practices. The PCTA's efforts to manage these challenges reflect the trail's enduring appeal and the importance of preserving its unique character for future generations.", "answers": ["Hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail can expect to encounter harsh-but-beautiful landscapes, extreme fatigue, and—these days, at least—traffic. \"You can’t talk about the Pacific Crest Trail without mentioning the crowds,\" Pete Brook writes for Outside.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said.

This crow-sized dinosaur, named after the Mandarin word for rainbow, possesses unique feather structures that shimmer with colors shifting in the light, similar to hummingbirds. Researchers from the Field Museum in Chicago and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have studied the fossil and determined that Caihong likely had a colorful appearance, possibly serving as a social or sexual signal.\n\nThe dinosaur's head and chest are particularly adorned with iridescent feathers, while its body has dark feathers and ribbon-like iridescent ones on the head and neck. Its small size, bird-like characteristics, and presence of a Velociraptor-like skull suggest it was a two-legged predator. The fossil's well-preserved feathers contain remnants of melanosomes, which indicate the presence of pigmentation.\n\nCaihong's feathers, with their pancake-shaped melanosomes, are distinct from those of birds, and its forelimbs are relatively short, unlike those of birds that have evolved from small feathered dinosaurs. The discovery challenges the commonly held belief that dinosaurs were all brown or gray, revealing a more vibrant and diverse world than previously imagined.\n\nThe study also discusses the possibility that Caihong's feathers, aside from attracting mates, might have served as insulation. The dinosaur's unique tail feathers, with their asymmetrical arrangement, are the oldest known example of this adaptation in animals.\n\nThe researchers are intrigued by the dinosaur's combination of feather types and the potential functions of its crested head, which could have been a display feature. Further study is needed to understand the specific roles of iridescent feathers in Caihong's behavior and whether they varied between males and females.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Caihong juji provides valuable insights into the diversity of feather colors and patterns in dinosaurs and the possible roles they played in communication and evolution.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax aimed to reduce sugar consumption, fund community college and healthy food subsidies, but its implementation led to a 64% increase in the price of a Gatorade bottle and a significant decrease in sales, particularly at Costco. Retailers like Costco directed customers to nearby locations to avoid the tax, causing a loss of revenue for the city. Opponents argue that the tax is regressive, as it disproportionately affects low-income families, and that it does not effectively promote health. The tax's opponents, including businesses, libertarians, and labor unions, united against it. Cook County, Illinois, recently repealed its own soda tax after a similar public backlash. The tax's effectiveness in achieving its health goals has been called into question, and the cost to businesses and consumers has been substantial. A proposed bill to introduce the soda tax statewide in Spokane, Washington, has been met with concerns from local businesses about potential price increases and the impact on their operations. The overall consensus is that the soda tax has failed to achieve its intended goals and has instead resulted in consumer resistance and economic consequences for the city.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

When she repeated it was polls, he responded, \"OK, which polls?” and Keilar said: “All of them.\" USA Today reports that Twitter users were quick to mock Cohen and are now replying \"Says who?\" to all his tweets. Cohen, in what Law Newz calls \"typical lawyer fashion,\" also took issue with Trump's overhaul of campaign staff being called a \"shake-up,\" insisting it was actually a \"change-up.\" Cohen also raised eyebrows when he told Kielar that Trump knows about \"the African-American problem in this country,\" the Independent reports. \"What I meant to say is the problem that exists in the African-American community,\" he later said.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The first lion, Mohawk, a popular tourist attraction, was shot dead by rangers after attacking a man, sparking outrage among locals who believed tranquilization should have been attempted first. The second lion, also in Kajiado, was killed due to its aggressive behavior towards a man, highlighting the challenges faced by wildlife officials in managing these situations.\n\nIn South Africa, a lion named Sylvester, which had escaped from Karoo National Park, was initially considered a threat to humans and was being debated over whether to kill it or capture and relocate it. The decision to kill was made after considering the potential danger to human life, similar to the situation in Kenya.\n\nThese incidents have sparked discussions about the effectiveness of electric fences in protecting wildlife, as lions have been able to escape from Nairobi National Park, a well-fenced area, and the impact of urbanization and infrastructure development on their habitats. Conservationists blame habitat loss as a significant factor contributing to the increased number of stray lions.\n\nThe incidents have also revealed the need for better training and resources for wildlife experts, as well as the importance of public education about coexistence with wildlife. Local residents have sometimes played a role in lion attacks, leading to calls for better communication and understanding between wildlife officials and communities.\n\nOverall, the news underscores the urgency of addressing the challenges faced by African lions, which are considered a vulnerable species due to their declining population, and the need for more sustainable management strategies to protect both wildlife and human lives.", "answers": ["An escaped lion, a taunting crowd, and an ill-prepared first-response team came together in Kenya to cause what some are saying was the unnecessary, senseless death of the lion, the country's Star reports.

The reliquary containing the ashes is tiny, measuring only 2.2 cm long and decorated with crosses, reflecting the importance of relics in early Christian pilgrimage.\n\nThe lead tube's presence at Burgas is linked to the belief that every year on May 8, a holy curing powder, or manna, would appear on John the Apostle's grave in Ephesus, another pilgrimage site. Only 43 lead tubes from this time period are known worldwide, with 20 of them found in Italy and one in Spain.\n\nThis discovery adds to the small number of lead tube reliquaries from the 6th century, which were typically used for holy water and were often gifts from rulers like Lombard Queen Theodelinda.

Simpson, now 70, was granted parole by a Nevada parole board after serving nine years for an armed robbery and kidnapping conviction. Simpson apologized for his role in the 2007 crime and expressed a desire to live conflict-free in Florida upon release. The hearing garnered significant media attention, reminiscent of the \"trial of the century\" from two decades earlier.\n\nSimpson's parole was based on several mitigating factors, including his record of discipline, stable release plans, and community support. The parole board members voted unanimously, with one member grading him as a \"low risk to reoffend.\" Simpson's daughter, Arnelle, testified on his behalf, describing him as her \"best friend and rock.\"\n\nThe Simpson case has been revisited in recent years, particularly through the documentaries \"O.J.: Made in America\" and the FX series \"The People v. O.J. Simpson,\" which shed light on issues of criminal justice, race, and celebrity. The murder trial's impact on society still resonates, with journalist Celia Farber stating that \"the story is O.J. and us.\"\n\nIn addition to Simpson's parole, the news brief mentions a separate topic about the Internet Archive's efforts to preserve web pages by archiving them as they are created and fixing broken links.

The baby was eventually rescued by Casselberry Police and is now in state custody. Markham faces charges of child neglect and is scheduled to appear in court in August for a hearing. Her future legal fate will be determined by a judge.\n\nIn the second story, a similar situation occurred but reversed. Sarah Markham, who had her son Caleb taken away from her by Seminole County Child Protective Services, regained custody after a judge ruled that there was no abuse or neglect. Caleb was initially diagnosed with failing to thrive, and Markham had wanted to use vegan formula instead of hospital treatment. The judge dismissed the county's claims, and Caleb is now back with his mother, who is providing a nutritionist's report as part of the custody agreement.\n\nBoth cases illustrate the complexities of parenting decisions, particularly when they conflict with medical advice, and the role of law in addressing such situations.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products.

A study by the University of Michigan revealed that one in every seven colorectal cancer patients is younger than 50, contradicting current guidelines that recommend screening at this age. The \"symptomless cancer\" often goes unnoticed due to its non-specific symptoms, such as changes in bowel habits or mild anemia, leading to advanced stages when diagnosed.\n\nYounger patients are more likely to have distant or regional malignancies, which are more aggressive and have worse survival rates compared to localized tumors. Treatment patterns differ, with younger patients undergoing more surgery and radiation therapy for distant rectal cancer. Despite having more advanced disease, they have slightly longer survival without recurrence.\n\nThe study, published in Cancer, calls for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. Researchers estimate that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and one in ten colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50. This rise in younger patients challenges the conventional wisdom and prompts discussions about whether screening guidelines should be adjusted.\n\nDr. Samantha Hendren, the lead author, acknowledges the need for further research to determine if changing the screening age would be beneficial, considering the potential benefits and costs. Meanwhile, experts like Dr. Andrew Chan from Harvard Medical School caution against expanding screening to younger age groups, stating that the risk is still low but more research is needed.\n\nThe importance of early detection through symptoms like blood in stool and family history cannot be overstated, as doctors should be vigilant for these signs in younger patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The find, made by Giles Hamm and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard, was initially stumbled upon during a toilet break. The site, known as Warratyi, contains evidence of human activity, including blackened roofs indicating fire-making and the presence of sophisticated tools and bone fragments from the largest marsupial species, Diprotodon optatum.\n\nThe discovery challenges the commonly accepted timeline of human arrival in Australia, suggesting that people may have reached the northern regions much earlier than previously thought. The presence of these artifacts and bones at Warratyi, along with the use of ochre, pushes back the earliest known dates for key technological developments in the region. The site's location in the arid interior of Australia, far from coastal settlements, highlights the ingenuity of the earliest Australians.\n\nExcavations at Warratyi uncovered around 4,300 objects and 200 bone fragments, providing valuable insights into the lives and technologies of these early humans. The site's age, around 49,000 years, is the oldest known in the arid zone, surpassing the previous record at Puritjarra by around 11,000 years.\n\nThe discovery also supports the theory that humans coexisted with megafauna, as bones from Diprotodon optatum and eggs from an ancient bird were found at the site. This interaction, although not necessarily hunting, suggests a complex relationship between humans and the environment.\n\nThe research, published in Nature, challenges the notion that Indigenous Australians were less innovative than other populations, as the development of stone tools and bone technology occurred locally. The findings challenge Eurocentric views on the simplicity of Australian material culture.\n\nWhile the dating of some artifacts, like the tiny axe fragment, is still under debate, the overall significance of the Warratyi site underscores the rapid expansion of humans into the Australian interior within a short period after their initial arrival. This discovery contributes to our understanding of the early history and cultural evolution of Australia's Indigenous peoples.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "The news articles cover various scientific discoveries and insights into the evolution of humans and their tool-making abilities. Here's a summary:\n\n1. A study published in Science suggests that dramatic climate changes in East Africa around 320,000 years ago may have driven the development of toolmaking advancements and trading networks among Homo sapiens or their relatives. The discovery of new Middle Stone Age tools and red pigment in Olorgesailie Basin, Kenya, indicates a shift in foraging behavior and the potential for long-distance communication through the use of obsidian, a rare material found far away.\n\n2. Researchers have uncovered the oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. These tools, including spearpoints and smaller implements, show a gradual downsizing trend, possibly indicating increased mobility and adaptation to changing environments. However, the exact origin of these tools (Homo sapiens or a closely related species) is uncertain due to the lack of fossil evidence.\n\n3. The Olorgesailie region's tools, made from obsidian, suggest the existence of trading networks among dispersed human populations. This implies that H. sapiens or their ancestors were able to cope with environmental stress by partnering with neighboring communities and innovating their tool-making techniques.\n\n4. The shift from the Acheulian culture to the Middle Stone Age in Olorgesailie is marked by the appearance of smaller, specialized tools, which indicate advanced thinking and planning. These tools were made with fine-grained materials and were likely used for specific purposes, such as hunting and possibly symbolic purposes.\n\n5. The new findings challenge the traditional view that modern behaviors emerged only after humans migrated out of Africa. Archaeologists now believe that some aspects of \"human revolution\" occurred much earlier, around 300,000 years ago, in response to environmental changes in the region.\n\n6. The Olorgesailie discoveries suggest that one or more hominin groups were engaging in seemingly \"modern\" activities, involving the transportation of exotic materials and the transmission of technological skills. This implies the existence of expanded social networks and the potential for cultural and cognitive evolution before the emergence of Homo sapiens.\n\nIn summary, these findings challenge the conventional timeline of human evolution, revealing that the development of modern behaviors and tool-making capabilities occurred earlier than previously thought, possibly in response to environmental pressures in East Africa. The existence of trading networks and technological innovation among early humans highlights the adaptability and complexity of our ancestors.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The author uses terms like \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" and \"stupidity\" to describe Apple's choice, which has sparked anger among consumers who argue that the removal creates inconvenience and limits compatibility.\n\nUsers express frustration at the lack of a standard aux cable input, with some even comparing it to Apple's previous decisions that removed CD drives and 30-pin connectors. The article highlights that wired audio often sounds better than wireless, and the author personally experienced the benefits of wired headphones after switching from Bluetooth.\n\nThe author also points out that Apple's claim about space constraints inside the iPhone is questioned, as they are removing a widely used feature without offering a viable alternative.

{"pred": "The latest scientific findings reveal a significant shift in our understanding of Mars' past. Mars, once believed to have had a limited and sporadic water presence, is now revealed to have had a massive ancient ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere, comparable to Earth's Atlantic, around 4.5 billion years ago. This ocean, which was up to a mile deep, contained 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to the Arctic Ocean, and was a key factor in the planet's early habitability.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, used advanced infrared telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere and detect variations in water molecule isotopes, indicating a significant loss of normal hydrogen (H2) over time, leaving behind a higher concentration of deuterium (HDO). This process, known as fractionation, suggests that Mars has lost a substantial amount of water, equivalent to six times what's currently stored in its polar caps.\n\nThe researchers calculated that the original water volume was enough to create a global ocean covering the entire planet to a depth of 137 meters. However, the water likely pooled in lower-lying areas, forming an ocean that covered almost a fifth of the planet's surface. This discovery challenges the commonly held belief that Mars was a dry and inhospitable planet.\n\nThe presence of such a large ancient ocean implies that Mars may have had a more favorable environment for life to exist, as it was warm enough for liquid water to persist for millions of years. The search for life on Mars is expected to intensify in 2018 with the launch of the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which aims to find chemical signs of life.\n\nWhile the exact amount of water on Mars in the past is still uncertain due to the potential bias introduced by the escaping hydrogen, these findings significantly broaden the possibilities for the planet's habitability and the potential for past microbial life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Nestlé had been trying to protect the unique shape as a trademark for over a decade, but the court ruled that the previous decision to annul the trademark was correct. This means that KitKat's protected European status may be revoked, allowing for similar products, like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, to be sold without legal restrictions. The ruling also puts pressure on other similar snacks that may have similar shapes but are not protected by trademarks.\n\nThe case, which started in 2002, was about whether the KitKat brand had become distinctive enough to deserve its trademark based on its shape alone. The ECJ found that the evidence provided by Nestlé did not meet the requirement for recognition across all EU countries. This decision could potentially affect other iconic chocolate brands, as trademark disputes often involve arguing for distinctiveness across the European Union.\n\nMondelez, the maker of Cadbury, also challenged Nestlé's trademark, and although its appeal was dismissed, the case may still be reconsidered by the EU trademark office. The outcome of this process could determine the future of the KitKat shape trademark in the EU.\n\nThe legal battle over the KitKat shape highlights the complexities of trademark law in the European Union, with differing national histories affecting the recognition of a brand's distinctiveness. The case has also been seen as a potential Brexit issue, with some arguing that EU courts have not adequately defended a British brand.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long known for their iconic roars in popular culture, may not have sounded like the fierce beasts portrayed in movies like \"Jurassic Park.\" A recent study published in the journal Evolution suggests that the T. rex and other dinosaurs likely produced more bird-like sounds, closer to the coo of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich. These \"closed-mouth vocalizations\" were low, throaty whooshes, unlike the high-pitched calls of birds with open beaks.\n\nThe study, based on analysis of animal vocalizations, found that about a quarter of 200 bird species analyzed emit closed-mouth sounds, with larger-bodied dinosaurs like doves and ostriches being more likely to have this trait. The researchers believe that this vocal ability evolved independently in different groups, including birds and crocodiles, and it could have existed in dinosaurs as well.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on \"Jurassic Park,\" shared that creating the film's dinosaur sounds involved mixing real and synthetic sounds. For instance, the raptor's hissing was inspired by a goose's angry response, and the T. rex roar was created using a slowed-down baby elephant sound.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of body size in vocalization, with closed-mouth sounds being more common in larger-bodied birds. This aligns with the hypothesis that some extinct non-avian dinosaurs, like dinosaurs, might have had similar vocal capabilities, particularly for sexually selected displays.\n\nWhile direct fossil evidence of dinosaur vocalizations is lacking, the findings provide insights into the potential sounds these creatures might have produced. Future research aims to bridge the gap between living birds and their extinct dinosaur relatives by combining fossil, genetic, and physiological data to reconstruct dinosaur vocalizations.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

In 2005, a US soldier from the 87th Supply Battalion distributed new uniforms, unrelated to the Benghazi controversy, but the State Department was concerned about the potential impact of Marines wearing uniforms on diplomacy in the region during the attack.\n\n2. The Benghazi Select Committee's final majority report, released in 2015, revealed a discrepancy between the public narrative provided by the Obama administration and the private communications among officials. The report concluded that the administration intentionally misled the public about the cause and nature of the attack, which was identified as a terrorist act by intelligence early on.\n\n3. The report includes a timeline that contrasts the public statements made by Secretary Clinton with private conversations that showed a different understanding of the events. For instance, Clinton initially condemned the attack without mentioning a protest or video, but later acknowledged it was a terrorist act.\n\n4. Representative Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo, both members of the majority, signed onto the official report and authored an additional 51-page report that further details the inconsistencies between public and private accounts.\n\n5. The report's release was met with criticism from some, particularly from Representative Elijah Cummings, who ranked his time on the committee as one of the lowest in his career due to its partisanship and lack of transparency.\n\n6. The report itself did not change the public's understanding of the Benghazi attack, but it criticized the State Department for not adequately addressing the growing extremism in Libya and for Clinton's initial response that blamed the violence on a video.\n\n7. The release of the Democratic rebuttal to the GOP's report aimed to correct the findings and highlight the committee's belief that the investigation was overly partisan and costly.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the political fallout surrounding the Benghazi attack, with the report revealing a discrepancy between the official narrative and the truth as revealed through private communications.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked.

Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country is currently undergoing significant political and social changes following the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. The latest round of parliamentary elections, the third phase, took place as prosecutors presented their case against Mubarak, charging him with tyranny and violence. Islamists, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, are expected to gain further ground, consolidating their lead over more conservative groups like Nour. The election results are uncertain due to the military council's handling of seat allocation, and the nature of the new parliament remains unclear.\n\nEconomic challenges persist, with slow growth and foreign currency reserves declining. The trial of Mubarak, who has pleaded not guilty, is seen as a test for future rulers and a reminder of accountability for breaking the law. The Brotherhood, despite its electoral successes, has stated it aims to form a coalition government to avoid alienating liberals and Westerners. The trial, which resumes after a two-month break, has been marred by legal disputes and the prosecutor's accusations against Mubarak have sparked public attention.\n\nThe upcoming parliament, due to convene on January 23, will likely face conflicts between the military council, the Brotherhood, Salafis, and revolutionary forces. The election outcome and the formation of a new government are crucial for Egypt's transition, with protests planned for January 25 to mark the one-year anniversary of Mubarak's fall.\n\nGamal Mubarak, the former president's son, and other defendants face corruption charges, adding to the political landscape's tensions. The trial's outcome could determine the severity of Mubarak's punishment, potentially including the death penalty if found guilty of complicity in the protesters' deaths.\n\nOverall, Egypt's political landscape is marked by uncertainty, economic challenges, and a delicate balance between Islamists, liberals, and the military, all vying for power and influence in the post-Mubarak era.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house.

Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far.

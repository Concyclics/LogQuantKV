{"pred": "Two recent studies, published by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, have revealed a surprising connection between cigarette smoke and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). These findings highlight the negative impact of smoking on the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in causing infections.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers discovered that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA by altering its cell walls. The bacteria become less susceptible to the immune system's defenses, such as reactive oxygen species, and are more adept at adhering to human cells, making them harder to treat and potentially more lethal. The study showed that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was four times more resistant to macrophage killing, a key mechanism for eliminating bacteria, and was even more resistant to antimicrobial peptides.\n\nIn a separate study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, e-cigarette vapor was also found to have a similar effect, making MRSA more resistant and increasing its ability to invade human cells. However, the researchers noted that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant and aggressive, leading to a higher mortality rate in mice when compared to MRSA that had not been exposed to smoke.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke acts as a \"warning signal\" to MRSA, enhancing its ability to resist antibiotics and evade the immune system. This could contribute to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infections, particularly those caused by MRSA. The studies emphasize the need for smokers to quit smoking not only for their own health but also to reduce the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nBoth studies highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between smoking and bacteria, as they contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance and the potential for increased infection rates.

AFM affects the nervous system, causing symptoms like muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and in severe cases, paralysis. The exact cause of AFM is unknown, but it has been linked to viruses like enteroviruses and adenoviruses.\n\nIn 2014, a significant outbreak was linked to enterovirus D68, but the CDC has not detected the virus in recent cases.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have found inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns on the cloth, suggesting they could not have been produced by a person lying on the fabric as it is commonly assumed. The study, led by Matteo Borrini of Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions of the wounds on the figure, and their analysis revealed that the blood flow patterns do not match the positions seen on the shroud.\n\nThe researchers tested the bloodstains with both human and synthetic blood, comparing them to the positions on the shroud, and found that the angles of the rivulets on the fabric do not match the ones that would be expected if the body were laid flat. For instance, the hand markings on the shroud indicate an angle that is not consistent with the position of the hand in a crucifixion scenario, with some angles differing by up to 45 degrees.\n\nThe investigation has ruled out the possibility that the bloodstains are consistent with a person being crucified, as the blood flow patterns on the shroud do not match the natural flow from a hanging or standing position. The researchers have suggested that the bloodstains are more consistent with a model being posed, which would explain the inconsistent patterns.\n\nWhile the study does not definitively prove the shroud's authenticity, it casts doubt on the traditional belief that the blood patterns are a result of the crucifixion. The investigation highlights the need for further scientific analysis to determine the true origin of the image on the cloth.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

This marked the first time in living memory that a British company faced such a shareholder rejection for executive pay. The move comes amid falling oil prices and the company's plans to cut 7,000 jobs.\n\nProxy advisory firm Glass Lewis criticized the pay decisions, arguing that the bonuses were not commensurate with the company's performance. BP's remuneration committee defended the pay packages, stating that Dudley had met or exceeded his targets, including the reduction in oil spills and improved safety measures. However, the company's chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, promised to review the pay policy in consultation with shareholders.\n\nThis shareholder rebellion highlights the growing trend of institutional investors and advisors pushing for stricter executive pay controls, especially in the face of falling oil prices and underperforming companies. The issue will likely be a topic of discussion at the company's annual general meeting, and the board's decision on pay will be crucial in rebuilding investor confidence.\n\nIn the context of the industry, BP's pay package for Dudley was considered relatively high, with his total bonus being the maximum allowed. This contrasts with the situation at Shell, where CEO Van Beurden's pay fell from 2014 to 2015 despite the company's performance.\n\nThe rejection of the pay package could potentially lead to a review of the company's executive compensation policy, as the chairman acknowledged the need to address shareholders' concerns.

This growth has led to concerns about overcrowding and the potential negative impact on the trail and local communities. Inefficent hikers, who arrive unprepared and without proper Leave-No-Trace practices, are causing strain on the trail's resources and disrupting the harmony among hikers. The PCTA implemented a permit system with a daily quota of 50 to manage the number of hikers and protect the environment. While some hikers have reported positive experiences, the current system is being tested, with 2016 showing close to the 50-per-day capacity being reached. The PCTA encourages responsible hiking and the use of the hashtag #responsiblywild to promote safety and leave-no-trace principles.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial 1.75 cent per ounce soda tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding community projects, has faced significant backlash and is seen as a regressive measure that has led to decreased sales and a loss of revenue for the city. Former Mayor Ed Murray, who championed the tax, acknowledged its flaws and cited Cook County, Illinois' experience with a similar tax, which was repealed within two months, as a warning. The tax has been criticized for not affecting low-income families, as it disproportionately impacts the poor, and for causing a 64% increase in the cost of a $15.99 case of Gatorade. Retailers like Costco have responded by directing customers to nearby locations where the tax is not applied, leading to a decrease in sales within the city. The tax has been called regressive and has united diverse groups against it, including labor unions, businesses, and even some health advocates. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University suggests that Seattle's tax is among the most regressive in the country. The tax has also been met with protests and a 34% decline in sales at Costco and a 27% decrease at Fairplay Foods, highlighting the negative economic impact on local businesses. While some argue that a tax could have health benefits, the short-term effects have been disappointing, with residents choosing to buy beverages elsewhere to avoid the extra cost. A proposed bill to introduce a statewide soda tax in Spokane, Washington, faces similar concerns and potential harm to local businesses. The mixed reactions and the failure to achieve the desired health outcomes have led to calls for reconsideration of such measures.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Cohen claimed that Trump was \"colourblind\" but acknowledged the racial tensions in the country.\n\n- The interview with Cohen on CNN became awkward when Cohen repeatedly asked \"Says who?\" in response to the assertion that Trump's campaign was down in the polls. Cohen's disbelief in the polls' accuracy was evident, leading to a debate with CNN's anchor, Brianna Keilar.\n\n- Cohen's response to the poll question was seen as a campaign strategy to reiterate that the hiring of Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon was not a \"shake-up\" but rather a \"great move\" to improve the campaign's performance. Cohen's skepticism about the polls was met with disbelief from Keilar, who asked, \"Which polls?\" to which Cohen responded, \"All of them.\"\n\n- The shake-up in Trump's campaign included the addition of Steve Bannon as campaign chief executive and Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager, aimed to address the campaign's declining poll numbers. Cohen, Trump's special counsel, was dismissive of the polls and their impact on the campaign.\n\n- The exchange between Cohen and Keilar sparked the Twitter trend #SaysWho, where users mocked Cohen's repeated question and highlighted the irony of his campaign's position on polls. This interaction further fueled the debate about the validity of the polls and the perception of Trump's campaign.\n\nOverall, the news highlights the contentious relationship between Cohen and the media, as well as the internal workings of the campaign trying to counter negative poll numbers and regain favor.

There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

The breach involved the theft of some customer payment card information but did not confirm the compromise of sensitive data such as Social Security numbers.\n\nTarget, on the other hand, suffered a larger-scale attack that affected 40 million customers, including credit card numbers and PINs, as well as personal information of 70 million individuals. Neiman Marcus stated that it had no knowledge of a connection between their breach and Target's, and both companies were investigated by state attorneys general for potential criminal activity.\n\nA 17-page report by iSight, a computer firm hired by Target, shed light on the malware used in the breach, describing it as a type that has been prevalent in Eastern European and Brazilian underground since at least 2009. The report highlights the innovation and skill of the attackers, who exploited a vulnerability in the POS systems to steal credit card information without leaving a clear trail.\n\nThe investigation into the Target breach revealed that it was part of a larger, international operation, suggesting a coordinated effort by cybercriminals. The report emphasizes the need for increased vigilance against POS (point-of-sale) system vulnerabilities, as these types of attacks are becoming more prevalent due to the potential rewards and low risk for the attackers.\n\nIn the wake of the Target breach, the company offered free credit monitoring to affected customers and faced criticism for not disclosing the incident earlier. Meanwhile, the ongoing investigation by federal and private agencies aims to determine the source and coordination of these attacks, highlighting the growing threat of such sophisticated cybercrime campaigns.\n\nIn summary, the holiday data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target were part of a larger, international cybercrime campaign targeting retailers. The Neiman Marcus breach, which remained undetected for months, and Target's attack resulted in significant loss of personal and financial data. These incidents have prompted a closer examination of retail networks and the need for better protection against such sophisticated malware and cyberattacks.", "answers": ["It looks like the hackers that hit Target had lots of other, well, targets.

The second lion, also a 13-year-old, was shot after it injured a motorcyclist and had been on the loose for several days, causing panic and debate about the use of lethal force versus attempting to tranquilize the animals.\n\nMohawk, a popular and beloved lion in Kenya, was killed by KWS due to the lack of tranquilization equipment and the concern for human safety. The park's inadequate fencing, which allowed the lion to escape, has been a contributing factor to the recent incidents. In South Africa, a lion named Sylvester, which had also escaped from a park, sparked similar debates as wildlife officials considered relocating or killing the lion to protect both the animal and human lives.\n\nThese incidents have highlighted the challenges of balancing conservation efforts with the need to protect people, as local communities often come into contact with lions in their habitats.

The Casselberry Police found the baby in need of medical attention and took her to the hospital, where she was eventually released from custody but faces a court hearing in August to determine the future of her parenting rights. The baby is now in state custody.\n\nIn the second story, a similar situation occurred in Orlando, Florida, where a judge ruled that a mother, also named Sarah Markham, would regain custody of her child, Caleb, after he was taken away due to concerns about his health. Caleb was less than 2 weeks old when he was found to be losing weight, and despite the doctor's recommendation, Markham preferred to use vegan formula. The judge threw out the initial claim of child neglect by the Seminole County Child Protective Services, and the mother is now required to provide a nutritionist's report within 10 days. This case underscores the delicate balance between parental rights and medical advice, as well as the importance of following professional recommendations in matters of child welfare.", "answers": ["A judge in Florida has allowed a vegan mom who defied a doctor's orders to regain custody of her infant son, reports WFTV. The strange case began in June when police in Casselberry charged Sarah Markham with neglect and took away 2-week-old Caleb. The charges came after a pediatrician diagnosed Caleb as dehydrated and underweight, and told Markham to take him to the hospital immediately, recounts WKMG. Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham. The child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother's care, and now weighs about 17 pounds. \"He's still on a soy formula,\" says Bo Markham.

{"pred": "A significant increase in colorectal cancer cases among younger patients, particularly those under 50, has been revealed by a series of recent studies. These findings challenge the traditional belief that colorectal cancer is mainly a disease affecting older individuals. According to the University of Michigan's study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the US were younger than 50, with advanced-stage tumors being more common in this age group. Younger patients are more likely to receive aggressive treatments, such as surgery, and have slightly better survival rates, despite the advanced diagnosis. However, the study's authors recommend reconsideration of screening guidelines, as nearly 15% of patients might be missed if the current recommendation of starting screening at 50 remains unchanged.\n\nThe rise in colorectal cancer among younger patients is attributed to delayed detection due to symptoms like anemia, dark blood in stool, or changes in bowel habits, which can be mistaken for other conditions. However, a lack of family history and other risk factors can contribute to this phenomenon. While some experts argue that screening guidelines should be adjusted, others, like Harvard Medical School's Andrew Chan, suggest that the environmental factors like smoking, obesity, and poor diet could be influencing the rise, and more research is needed to determine if changing screening guidelines would be beneficial.\n\nThe study highlights the need for increased awareness and early detection in younger patients, as well as the potential for long-term support for survivors. The decision to alter screening guidelines is complex, considering the balance between preventing cancer and the cost involved.\n\nIn summary, colorectal cancer is becoming a more prevalent issue among younger patients, and while the survival rates are better, the medical community must adapt its screening practices to identify and treat these younger patients effectively. Further research is necessary to determine the optimal age for starting screening and the impact of these changes on overall cancer prevention.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

A recent paper by Dan Hooper suggests that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial to prevent the universe's expansion from isolating civilizations from the stars' energy. Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations would secure stars and capture them using structures like Dyson spheres or millions of individual satellites, known as \"statites,\" to harvest their energy.\n\nStars beyond a certain size, such as those with a mass between 20 to 100 times that of Earth's sun, would be ideal for harvesting due to their radiation wavelengths.

The concept of Dyson spheres, which are massive satellite arrays, has been proposed by both science fiction author Olaf Stapledon and physicist Freeman Dyson. These structures could be recognized by their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation.\n\nIn the context of the expanding universe, the paper highlights the importance of securing stars before they become inaccessible due to the acceleration caused by dark energy.

The show's initial format, led by former ESPN anchor Craig Kilborn, had a focus on lampooning local news and pop culture. When Stewart joined, he aimed to make the show more political, with a focus on satire and criticism of the media. The show's new format included a shift in tone, with Stewart's desire to have the writers challenge their previous content and develop a more pointed, surgical approach.\n\nStewart's first move as host was to reevaluate and dismiss the writers who were resistant to his vision, leading to a tense atmosphere. The show's new head writer, Ben Karlin, brought a fresh perspective and a focus on criticizing the show's reliance on targeting \"helpless\" targets. Key correspondents like Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell were integral to the show's success, with their performances and characters often reflecting the real-life personalities of political figures.\n\nThe Daily Show's correspondents, including Colbert, were not professional journalists, but rather used their characters to parody the media and political landscape. Carell's memorable segment on John McCain's bus, where he asked a question that caught the candidate off guard, demonstrated the show's ability to delve beyond the surface of political coverage.\n\nThe show's success was partly due to the combination of Stewart's leadership, the writers' ability to create smart, funny, and opinionated content, and the off-camera support of writers like Ben Karlin.

{"pred": "The news articles cover groundbreaking discoveries in the field of archaeology, revealing the advanced tool-making and behavioral changes among early humans in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin. The research suggests that climate-driven shifts in the region led to the development of specialized tool-making, trading networks, and the use of long-distance materials like obsidian, which were not present in the region before. These tools, dating back to around 320,000 years ago, indicate a shift from earlier, larger hand axes to smaller, more specialized Middle Stone Age implements. The presence of obsidian from distant locations suggests the existence of trading networks among early humans, possibly hinting at the emergence of Homo sapiens or a closely related species.\n\nThe tools found in the area, including the Olorgesailie Middle Stone Age tools, are the oldest of their kind, with some dating back to around 320,000 years ago. These advancements in tool-making, along with the use of obsidian from distant regions, indicate the development of trading networks and the potential for inter-regional cooperation among early humans. The presence of pigment, possibly used for signaling or status, further supports the idea of cultural complexity and social interaction.\n\nThe shift from the earlier Acheulean culture to the Middle Stone Age tools indicates a period of innovation and adaptation to changing environments. The discovery of obsidian from far-off locations challenges the assumption that such technological advancements were limited to the emergence of Homo sapiens, suggesting that other hominid populations, possibly a separate species, were also involved in these developments.\n\nThe new findings challenge the concept of a \"human revolution\" that was previously believed to occur around 40,000-50,000 years ago, with evidence of modern behaviors, such as symbolism and art, being identified in the Olorgesailie Basin as early as 320,000 years ago. This suggests that the roots of these modern behaviors were present in Africa long before the migration of Homo sapiens.\n\nIn summary, the research underscores the adaptability and social complexity of early humans in the region, with the Olorgesailie discoveries providing a glimpse into the early stages of human evolution and the development of complex social systems.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR.

Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

A study published in the journal Science indicates that a massive ancient ocean, comparable to Earth's Atlantic, covered nearly a fifth of Mars' surface, with a depth of up to a mile, and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water. This ancient ocean, which persisted around 4.5 billion years ago, challenges the previous understanding of Mars as a planet with limited water presence.\n\nNASA scientists, using powerful telescopes, have observed a significant increase in the deuterium content in Mars' atmosphere, suggesting a global ocean that was enriched in heavy hydrogen (deuterium) by a factor of about 7 compared to Earth's oceans. This high D/H ratio indicates that the water in the polar reservoirs is enriched to 8 times the Earth's standard value, potentially indicating a global equivalent water layer that was 137 meters deep. The study suggests that Mars may have had a more habitable past, with the presence of liquid water supporting the possibility of life.\n\nNotably, the discovery of a global ocean on Mars raises questions about the planet's ability to retain water, as it appears to have lost a significant amount of water over time. The researchers caution that these findings represent the minimum amount of water, as the true quantity could have been much larger due to the planet's unique hydrogen-to-deuterium ratio.\n\nThese findings have implications for the search for extraterrestrial life, as the presence of liquid water in the past suggests a more conducive environment for life to exist. However, the exact habitability of Mars remains a topic of debate, with some scientists suggesting that the planet's current conditions may still be inhospitable to life. The upcoming European Space Agency's Exomars rover mission in 2018 aims to further investigate the planet's potential habitability by searching for chemical signs of life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

He charms.\" There's also \"combustible chemistry\" between Smith and Robbie, but the movie just \"disappoints,\" Rea writes. \"Even if you're willing to forgive its sinkhole plotholes and farthest-fetched conceits, the film ... ultimately makes no sense.\" Betsy Sharkey, on the other hand, says this \"rom-com-con\" is \"an irresistible reminder of all the reasons we first fell for the Fresh Prince so many years ago.\" Writing at the Los Angeles Times, she notes the romantic role of Nicky fits Smith perfectly, while Robbie is \"more than holding her own\" as his match. \"The scams are Rubik's Cube complicated, but what keeps you guessing is whether the romantic connection between Jess and Nicky is real or just another con.\" But Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle isn't convinced. In a review titled \"Will Smith just stole $12 from your pocket,\" he argues Focus is \"ridiculous in every detail. It's a movie with no truth that teaches nothing and shows nothing, that has only its audacity to recommend it.\" Nicky and Jess lack \"impact,\" partly because \"Smith is not a strong leading man,\" he says.

This comes after a long legal battle between Nestlé and rival chocolate manufacturer Mondelez, with Nestlé arguing that the unique shape of its KitKat was a trademark. The court's decision means the European Union's Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must reconsider Nestlé's trademark application. The ruling has implications for other brands operating in the European market, as it highlights the need for a product's distinctiveness to be recognized across all EU countries for it to be protected. The case, which has been ongoing for over a decade, has been closely watched by trademark lawyers and has occasionally been cited in debates about the UK's relationship with the EU, with some suggesting the ruling could affect the popularity of the KitKat in the UK.\n\nIn the meantime, both companies, Nestlé and Mondelez, are likely to continue fighting for their respective trademarks, with Nestlé stating that it believes the EU trademark office will ultimately uphold the shape's trademark. The outcome could still impact other countries' national trademarks, as the court's ruling does not necessarily mean the end of the KitKat's EU trademark, but rather necessitates a broader assessment of its distinctiveness across the entire market.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long thought to roar with the ferocity of movie monsters, might have sounded more like birds, according to new research. The study published in the journal Evolution argues that the ancient reptiles, known as archosaurs, primarily used \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" which are low-throat sounds similar to those of pigeons or doves. These sounds, unlike the high-pitched chirps of birds with open mouths, were likely produced through a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch. The researchers found that only large-bodied birds, like doves and ostriches, exhibited this type of vocalization, suggesting it may have evolved separately in dinosaurs as well.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the iconic Jurassic Park, explained that creating the sounds for the dinosaurs involved mixing real animal noises, such as goose hissing for raptors and the cooing of a mating tortoise for the T. rex. The raptors' sounds were a mix of horse noises, and the sounds of the dinosaurs like the T. rex were slowed down to create a more menacing effect. The study suggests that non-avian dinosaurs, like the T. rex, may have had a bird-like vocal organ, allowing for a variety of sounds, including the distinctive \"throaty\" roars.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations, which are produced by pushing air into the esophageal pouch, were found to be uncommon in small-bodied birds, like sparrows, but were more prevalent in larger birds like doves and ostriches. This behavior, which requires a specific vocal technique, suggests that it may have evolved independently in birds and dinosaurs, possibly for sexual selection displays.\n\nWhile there is no direct fossil evidence of dinosaur vocalizations, the combination of bird-like sounds and the absence in smaller-bodied dinosaurs implies that closed-mouth vocalizations were present in some dinosaurs, particularly in large-bodied lineages. This could mean that dinosaurs, like birds, had the capacity for vocal displays, but the specific sounds remain uncertain due to the lack of preserved fossils.\n\nIn conclusion, the study challenges the common perception of dinosaur roars and suggests that these ancient reptiles, including the iconic T. rex, might have had a more subtle, bird-like vocal repertoire. Further research is needed to uncover the specific sounds of extinct dinosaurs based on the available data from living birds.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The university had previously attempted to change the name in 2002 but was unsuccessful due to a legal challenge from the Tennessee Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In 2005, the university started referring to the building as Memorial Hall, and the recent decision to rename it was made after raising $1.2 million, which allows the university to fulfill its end of the original $50,000 donation made by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1933.\n\nVanderbilt Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos, who has long advocated for the change, explained that the building's name is \"offensive and painful\" to many, and that the university aims to use the space as a \"teaching tool\" rather than a symbol of division. The university's decision has sparked controversy, with some critics arguing that altering the name erases the history of Confederate soldiers. However, Vanderbilt argues that it is teaching history through the context of the building's name, rather than simply honoring it.\n\nThe move comes as universities across the country grapple with similar challenges in addressing the legacy of Confederate symbols and addressing diversity issues.

Starting in 2014, after being recast for Tommen, Chapman's role as Martyn Lannister was a brief one, appearing in only two episodes during Season 3. This revelation has caused a stir due to the striking resemblance between Martyn and Tommen, despite their different roles and the fact that many viewers missed the connection.\n\nThe connection between Martyn and Tommen becomes even more intriguing when considering their shared family background. Martyn is a son of Kevan Lannister, who is Tywin's younger brother. This means that Tommen, as a character, is also a cousin in the fictional world of Game of Thrones, although not in the traditional sense. The fact that no one noticed this until now highlights the subtle nature of the casting and the importance of careful observation in the entertainment industry.\n\nThis discovery adds a layer of depth to the character of Tommen, as it raises questions about the possibility of a \"faceless man\" theory, which suggests Tommen might have a hidden connection to the Lannister family. The overlap between the two roles also underscores the complex web of relationships and family ties within the Game of Thrones universe.\n\nIn summary, this news highlights the hidden connections and character nuances within the Game of Thrones universe, revealing the intricate web of relationships and the importance of paying close attention to details in storytelling.

{"pred": "The news articles provide a detailed analysis of the Benghazi attack and the political response to it. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n1. State Department officials, including then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were initially concerned about the use of uniforms for the Marines, fearing they might harm diplomatic relations in the region. However, the Benghazi Select Committee report reveals that the focus of the meeting on September 11, 2012, was more on the attack's cause and less on evacuation plans.\n\n2. The House Benghazi Select Committee found that the administration, including Clinton, intentionally provided a false narrative to the public, stating that the attacks were a result of a protest and not a terrorist act. This narrative was contradicted by private communications and statements made by officials.\n\n3. The report reveals that the State Department, undersecretary Patrick Kennedy, raised concerns about the use of uniforms, as they could potentially hinder security, but the military never deployed to Benghazi due to the lack of a specific attack plan.\n\n4. The report also highlights the confusion surrounding the video that was allegedly linked to the attacks in both Libya and Egypt. While the State Department's decision to change the uniforms was not seen as a delay in the military response, the military was still required to change their uniforms multiple times due to the situation.\n\n5. The report's release, along with the additional views by Rep. Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo, underscores the discrepancy between the public narrative and the private discussions within the administration. The report claims that the administration intentionally misled the public about the role of the video in the attack.\n\n6. The Benghazi Select Committee's report, led by Rep. Elijah Cummings, is criticized for being partisan and limiting the Democrats' access to information. Cummings asserts that the report does not alter the understanding of the attack's nature, despite the changes in the narrative.\n\n7. The report also accuses former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others of not adequately addressing the growing extremism in Libya, which was a contributing factor to the Benghazi attack.\n\nIn summary, the Benghazi attack was a coordinated terrorist event, but the administration initially presented it as a spontaneous protest, leading to a misleading narrative. The report's release and the Democrats' rebuttal highlight the need for accountability and the truth about the events, despite the administration's efforts to downplay the role of the video and the intelligence reports.", "answers": ["The Republican-led House Benghazi committee released its final report Tuesday after two years of investigations.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

Despite the surprise move, sources say Holmes has been \"genuinely touched\" by the letter, but it's unlikely to lead to a reconciliation at this stage.\n\nLOOK magazine also picks out key fashion trends for the season and shares Kristen Wiig's personal apology, while discussing cyber espionage and the work of a top makeup artist.

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country is undergoing significant political and social changes following the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. Egyptians recently voted in the third phase of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its gains. The trial of Mubarak, now in court, has been characterized by the prosecution accusing him of tyranny and oppression. The new parliament's role in the transition is uncertain, with ongoing tensions between the military council, Islamists, and revolutionary forces. Economic challenges, including slowing growth and a decrease in foreign currency reserves, are also affecting the nation.\n\nThe third phase of voting saw a focus on the nine provinces, with the Muslim Brotherhood's strongholds expected to gain more seats. The election results are crucial for the formation of a new government, with the military council's authority over the interim government a source of tension. The Brotherhood, led by former member of Parliament Mohamed Beltagi, aims to form a coalition government, possibly to avoid an all-Islamic government, which could concern both Westerners and liberal factions.\n\nMubarak's trial, which resumed after a two-month break, has seen the prosecution argue that he was a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression. The former president, along with his sons and associates, faces corruption charges. The trial's outcome remains uncertain, with the possibility of a harsher penalty for Mubarak if convicted.\n\nEconomic challenges, including slow growth and protests, continue to shape the political landscape. The upcoming parliamentary elections and Mubarak's trial are key events that will determine the future direction of the country and the distribution of power among different factions.

Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far.

{"pred": "On Wednesday evening, a car driven by Nabila Altahan, a passenger in the vehicle, experienced a near-catastrophic incident in Mendon, Massachusetts, after reacting too quickly to a GPS unit's unexpected turn-around instructions. The incident occurred on Route 4 when the car, which had strayed from the road, ended up suspended on a telephone guy wire due to the driver's rapid response to the GPS system's guidance. State Police reported that the car was going westbound when the GPS, mistaking the driver's position, prompted a U-turn, causing the car to leave the road and become stuck on the wire.\n\nFortunately, neither Altahan nor her passenger were injured in the accident. According to the police, the car had already passed its intended destination when the GPS malfunctioned, leading to the unusual situation. A witness, Ray Ault, who happened to be driving by, witnessed the incident and promptly called for help, which included the arrival of the State Police and the Rutland City Fire Department.\n\nIn summary, this incident highlights the importance of cautious adherence to GPS instructions and the potential dangers of overreacting to electronic navigation systems, especially when they misdirect drivers.

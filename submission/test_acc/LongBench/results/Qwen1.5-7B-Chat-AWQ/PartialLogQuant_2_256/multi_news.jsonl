The first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that exposure to cigarette smoke enhances the virulence of MRSA by making it more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and altering its cell walls, reducing its susceptibility to immune defenses. This makes the bacteria more difficult to eliminate and increases its adherence to human cells, potentially aiding in its survival and spreading.\n\nIn the second study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, researchers observed that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke became four times more resistant to macrophage killing, a key immune response. The bacteria also showed enhanced resistance to e-cigarette vapor, although the effect was less pronounced than that of cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke acts as a \"warning signal\" to MRSA, triggering it to develop resistance, and that this resistance can persist for 24 hours after initial exposure.\n\nThese findings emphasize the need for smokers to be aware that their exposure to cigarette smoke not only harms their own health but also contributes to the increased prevalence and severity of MRSA infections.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggests that the blood patterns on the cloth are inconsistent with the crucifixion wounds described in religious accounts, pointing to a standing model being used to create the stains rather than a corpse lying on the fabric.\n\nThe researchers, Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used blood flow analysis to compare the bloodstains on the shroud to those of a living person. They tested the flow in various positions, such as a hand in contact with wood, and found that the angles did not match the ones depicted on the shroud, which is typically associated with a person hanging from a cross.\n\nThe investigation rules out the possibility of the shroud being a genuine relic, as the blood patterns would be more consistent if the body was hanging or bleeding from the wounds. The researchers noted that the blood from the spear wound on the shroud flowed in a way that differs from what would be expected for a person on a cross, further supporting the conclusion that the bloodstains are not consistent with a crucifixion scenario.\n\nWhile the Vatican has not officially weighed in on the authenticity of the shroud, the investigation has reignited discussions about its origins and the authenticity of the blood patterns.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The PCTA reports a 300% increase in inquiries and permit requests for long-distance hikes since the publication of the book and the release of the film. The increase has led to concerns about overcrowding, with some hikers reporting that the 50-per-day permit quota is often reached during the peak season. The PCTA implemented the permit system in 2015 to manage the growing number of hikers and protect the trail and its environment. The concern is not just about physical overcrowding but also the potential for increased human waste, environmental damage, and financial costs. While some hikers are advocating for more organized systems, like a formalized sign-up process, to maintain the \"leave no trace\" principles, the PCTA and the hiking community are striving to balance the desire for more people to experience the trail with the need for responsible and sustainable hiking. The hope is that the current system, though crowded, is dispersing hikers and promoting a safe and enjoyable experience for all.", "answers": ["Hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail can expect to encounter harsh-but-beautiful landscapes, extreme fatigue, and—these days, at least—traffic. \"You can’t talk about the Pacific Crest Trail without mentioning the crowds,\" Pete Brook writes for Outside.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

Discovered in northeastern China, this small dinosaur, about the size of a crow, had feathers that featured rainbow colors, making it the first of its kind to be found. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, revealed that the dinosaur's feathers had intricate structures similar to those of hummingbirds, with microscopically structured melanosomes that produced iridescent hues. The researchers believe the feathers may have served as a sexual attraction or a display feature, similar to modern birds.\n\nCaihong's head and chest had prominent, pancake-shaped melanosomes, while its tail feathers were also large and well-preserved, with distinct vanes that showed a unique pattern of barbs. The dinosaur's small size and elongated forelimbs, along with its feathered tail, suggest it might have glided or flown, but its lack of a complete tail feathering rules out powered flight.\n\nThe study's authors, including evolutionary biologist Chad Eliason and paleontologist Xing Xu, discussed the significance of Caihong's discovery, suggesting it provides insights into the diversity of feathered dinosaurs and the potential for coloration in paravians.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation.

Former Mayor Ed Murray, who championed the tax, now admits it was a mistake. The tax has been criticized for not targeting all sugary beverages and causing a price hike, particularly at Costco, where a $15.99 case of Gatorade increased to $26.33. Some retailers, like Costco, have directed customers to nearby locations to avoid the tax, resulting in a decrease in sales for Seattle. The tax has also been met with protests from groups like the Chicago Restaurant Association and the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, who argue it is regressive and has led to lost sales for businesses. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University supports this view, stating that three of the top five states with the most regressive laws are California, Oregon, and Washington, where Seattle is located. The tax's failure to address health concerns and its impact on low-income families has fueled public opposition. While some, like the Starbucks corporation, have not imposed the tax, others, like the Illinois Public Health Institute, acknowledge the potential public health benefits of taxing sugary beverages. The tax's effectiveness in achieving its goals remains uncertain, with some arguing that the sudden price increase has pushed consumers to react negatively and shop elsewhere, impacting local businesses and potentially leading to reduced revenue for the city.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The app, developed by Xora, was required for all employees and allowed monitoring both work and off-duty hours. Arias claimed that her boss, John Stubits, admitted to using the app to track her location and speed during non-work hours, despite her objections. She alleged that the monitoring violated her privacy and was illegal. The suit also accuses Intermex of retaliation and unfair business practices. Arias, a former Intermex sales executive, was seeking damages over $500,000 and sought to halt the monitoring of her location when not working. The company did not immediately comment on the allegations.\n\nThe StreetSmart web-based management application, used by Intermex to manage employee locations and optimize operations, was mentioned in another news passage. It allows real-time tracking, route optimization, and employee productivity, enabling employees to record their activities, receive job assignments, and instantly communicate with the office. The app also has a feature that allows for continuous monitoring of work hours and GPS tracking, but the plaintiff in the case, Arias, specifically complained about the lack of an option to turn off the GPS function when not working.\n\nIn a separate news item, Intermex, a company that provides money transfer services, was accused of firing an employee for declining to use the app, which the plaintiff believed was an infringement of her privacy. The company, however, disputes the claim, stating that the monitoring was necessary for business interests. The employee, Gail Glick, Arias' attorney, argues that the constant monitoring without an opt-out violates California's privacy laws.\n\nLastly, a news snippet discusses the importance of delighting customers in the service industry, highlighting the need to deliver excellent service to retain customers. This context contrasts with the legal issue faced by Arias, who was fired for not complying with the company's tracking requirement.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights a growing concern over employee privacy in the workplace, with companies using technology to monitor their workers, often raising legal disputes.

Senate Democrats, however, are refusing to accept changes to the ACA, leaving House Speaker John Boehner in a difficult position. If the House passes a bill without the ACA provisions, it is unlikely to be signed by President Barack Obama, who would likely veto it. The Senate, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid, is expected to reject any attempts to delay the ACA, setting up a showdown that could result in a shutdown.\n\nA shutdown would have significant economic consequences, particularly in the Washington region, where the government employs a large portion of the workforce. The Senate has already stripped out the House's anti-ACA provisions, and the House must now pass a clean funding bill to avoid a shutdown.

So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The discovery was made at the ancient fortress of Burgas (formerly Poros), a medieval port in the Black Sea city of Burgas. The reliquary, once part of an early Christian basilica, is considered one of the most important finds in the Burgas Regional Museum of History.\n\nThe discovery was not the only archaeological find at the site. In addition to the John the Apostle's relic, the archaeologists also uncovered a 10th-century Bulgarian royal seal, indicating the rich history of the area. The site of the fortress and port of Burgas has been dated back to the Late Antiquity and saw various architectural changes, including the reuse of structures from the 4th to the 15th century.\n\nThe lead vessel containing the ashes is a small, 2.2 cm (less than an inch) long container, believed to have been used by early Christians who believed in the healing properties of the saint. The discovery echoes the importance of pilgrimage sites like the one in Turkey where John the Apostle's grave is located, which was also a center for Christian pilgrimage seeking healing.\n\nThe lead tube reliquary is unique, with only 43 known lead tubes from this period, all of which were used for producing clay tube reliquaries for holy water. The one from Burgas is distinct, featuring images that correspond to those found on clay tube reliquaries from Ephesus, suggesting a connection to the cult for the saint.\n\nThe lead tube reliquary is considered a holy possession, believed to preserve the belief that on May 8, the anniversary of John the Apostle's death, there is a holy powder called manna, which is said to have miraculous healing properties. The discovery adds to the rich history of Christian pilgrimage centers in the 6th century, including those in Ephesus, Mena, and other locations.\n\nThis discovery joins another similar relic found in 2010 near Burgas, which contained the relics of St. John the Baptist.

The company's Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz, explained that the move is aimed at fostering a \"freedom and responsibility\" culture, where employees can focus on their personal lives without worrying about work obligations. Under this policy, parents can choose to return to work part-time, full-time, or as needed, with the company continuing to pay them during their absence. This move is seen as a significant step forward in providing better work-life balance and attracting and retaining top talent.\n\nNetflix's commitment to employee support is evident in its decision to eliminate the need for employees to switch to state or disability pay, allowing them to manage their return to work in a way that suits their individual circumstances. The company believes that a supportive environment leads to better performance, as employees who are not stressed by family responsibilities tend to be more engaged and dedicated.\n\nThis new policy follows the lead of other tech companies like Yahoo, which doubled its maternity and paternity leave in 2013, recognizing the importance of such benefits in attracting and retaining skilled workers. However, it's worth noting that unlimited time off policies can also present challenges, as they might require effective communication and planning among employees to ensure projects and deadlines are not disrupted.\n\nIn conclusion, Netflix's new policy for unlimited leave demonstrates the company's commitment to employee well-being and work-life balance, while also acknowledging the potential complexities of such a program.

The planet's existence, if confirmed, would require a new planet classification, as the current IAU definition excludes Pluto.\n\nBrown, known as the \"Pluto Killer,\" initially believed Pluto to be in trouble due to its demotion after the IAU redefined the criteria for a planet. He and Batygin argue that Planet Nine, with a mass between five to ten times that of Earth, is the key to explaining the clustering of small objects in the outer solar system's distant regions. The planet's discovery would likely require a lucky observer to spot it, as it is far from the sun and would be extremely faint.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine has sparked controversy, with some fans of Pluto still hoping for its resurrection.

His associates, including Tom Riccio, were mentioned for their roles in the robbery, with Riccio accusing Simpson of orchestrating the crime.\n\nSimpson's parole was unanimous, with the parole board finding him a low risk to reoffend.

According to the University of Michigan's study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the US was younger than 50, with a higher likelihood of advanced-stage tumors and more aggressive treatments for these patients.\n\nThe study by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute found that younger patients were more likely to have distant malignancies, requiring surgery for younger patients (72%) compared to older ones (63%). Additionally, younger rectal cancer patients were more likely to receive radiation therapy (53%) than older patients (48%). Despite the advanced stage at diagnosis, younger patients had slightly better survival rates, with a 5-year survival rate of 95% for localized tumors and 70% for regional tumors.\n\nResearchers from Cancer warn that the medical community needs to improve risk assessment and screening decisions for younger patients, as they are catching colorectal cancer at a later stage, potentially leading to worse outcomes. However, there is a debate about whether changing the screening guidelines to start at a younger age would be beneficial, as it could have both positive and negative effects, with the potential to save lives but also expose young people to unnecessary tests.\n\nDr. Andrew Chan, from Harvard Medical School, notes that the increase in colon cancer among younger adults is unexplained and may be linked to environmental factors such as smoking, obesity, and unhealthy diets. While the risk is rising, he cautions against altering screening guidelines without further research.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients necessitates a reevaluation of screening guidelines and a focus on early detection and tailored treatment strategies. However, the decision to change the recommended age for screening should be carefully considered due to the potential benefits and challenges involved.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The presence of blackened roofs and burning fires indicated human activity, with evidence of sophisticated tools and ochre use, as well as bone fragments from the extinct Diprotodon optatum, suggesting coexistence with megafauna.\n\nThe site's age, around 49,000 years, pushes back the earliest known date for the development of key technological advancements like stone axes and ochre use in Australia. The excavation of 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from the site, along with the discovery of a complex stratigraphy, indicates a diverse and dynamic cultural landscape.\n\nThese findings challenge the commonly held belief that humans entered the arid interior of Australia later, as the evidence of early human interaction with megafauna, like the extinct Diprotodon, implies a closer relationship than previously thought.

The paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds a new perspective by suggesting that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial to prevent the universe's expansion from isolating civilizations. Hooper argues that advanced civilizations would actively secure star energy to avoid the eventual unobservability of distant stars due to the expansion of the universe driven by dark energy.\n\nAccording to Hooper, any advanced civilization would attempt to capture and harvest stars, using a Dyson sphere or a swarm of satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" to collect and transmit energy back to their home planet. These structures would be necessary to maximize the utilization of energy as the universe expands and makes distant stars inaccessible. The search for alien civilizations, particularly those that have harvested stars, could involve looking for unusual galaxy signatures or detecting the waste heat emitted by such structures.\n\nThe feasibility of creating Dyson spheres is discussed, with the possibility that they could be made from millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, like \"statites,\" which would hover around a star and collect energy. These concepts have appeared in science fiction, such as in Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" and \"Star Trek\" episodes.\n\nIn summary, the key points are:\n\n1.

The show's format initially resembled a conventional news program, with segments like \"Headlines,\" \"Other News,\" and pre-taped interviews. Jon Stewart's vision for the show was to be more pointed, focused on satire and criticism of local news, and to have a deeper impact on political issues.\n\nDuring the Kilborn era, the show's writers were considered indispensable, but when Stewart came on, he had to reevaluate their work and make changes. The relationship between Stewart and the writers, including Ben Karlin, was marked by conflict and a power struggle, with some jokes and segments being seen as inappropriate. The introduction of Stephen Colbert as a correspondent was a turning point, as his natural ease on camera and ability to blend humor with political commentary resonated with the audience.\n\nUnder Stewart's guidance, the show shifted its focus, using correspondents like Steve Carell and Colbert to lampoon the media and political figures. The show's correspondents were encouraged to have their own opinions and beliefs, which added a level of authenticity to their segments. The show's success was partly due to its ability to comment on the media's coverage and the political landscape, particularly during the 1998-2000 period when networks like CNN and Fox News were expanding their presence.\n\nIn summary, The Daily Show evolved from a straightforward comedy show to a satirical news program, using its platform to criticize and lampoon political figures and media practices. The show's success was built on the chemistry between Stewart and his correspondents, as well as the off-screen alliances with writers like Ben Karlin and Steve Carell.

These changes suggest a period of increased mobility and adaptation to changing environments, possibly driven by frequent climate shifts between wet and dry conditions. The presence of obsidian, a sign of long-distance trade, indicates the formation of social networks and the exchange of resources.\n\nThe Olorgesailie tools, including hand axes and obsidian, were likely used for various tasks, such as digging for water and hunting, and the discovery of pigment lumps suggests the use of color for signaling or status. The shift to Middle Stone Age tools around 320,000 years ago, marked by the presence of specialized stone tools and obsidian sourced from distant areas, indicates a more sophisticated level of technology and possibly the emergence of modern human behaviors.\n\nThe new findings challenge the traditional concept of a \"human revolution\" that was believed to occur around 40,000-50,000 years ago, suggesting that modern behaviors and innovations were present in Africa much earlier than previously thought.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The situation is described as \"beyond control\" for both sides, with Israel reporting three deaths and 30 Palestinians killed since the start of the airstrikes.\n\nEgypt's prime minister, Hesham Kandil, visited Gaza to denounce the Israeli aggression and express a desire for a truce, but the three-hour ceasefire agreed upon during his visit did not hold. The United States asked countries to pressure Hamas to stop the rocket attacks, and Egypt's mediation efforts were seen as a potential step towards a resolution.

{"pred": "The recent discoveries in the field of planetary science have shed light on Mars' past, revealing a significant body of water that once covered a large portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. A study published in the journal Science indicates that a massive ancient ocean, comparable to Earth's Atlantic, covered nearly a fifth of Mars' surface, with a volume of 20 million cubic kilometers, around 4.5 billion years ago. This ancient ocean, estimated to be up to 137 meters deep, was composed of heavy water molecules, as indicated by a higher concentration of deuterium in the remaining water vapor in the Martian atmosphere.\n\nNASA scientists, using powerful infrared telescopes, have discovered that the planet's atmospheric deuterium enrichment suggests a significant water loss over time. The concentration of deuterium in water near the polar caps is as high as 8 times Earth's standard (VSMOW), indicating that Mars had a global equivalent water layer that was enriched to 137 meters or more. This water loss is inferred from the increased concentration of deuterium, which implies that Mars had a much thicker water cover in its youth.\n\nThese findings challenge the previous understanding of Mars' water presence, as it was believed that the planet had a limited and intermittent water presence. The presence of a global ocean on Mars raises the possibility of habitability, with the potential for life to have existed in the distant past. However, the exact amount of water and the likelihood of life are still subjects of ongoing research and debate.\n\nIn addition to the ancient ocean, Mars' current methane detection by the Curiosity rover has sparked speculation about the existence of life, but the scientific community is cautious, acknowledging that while conditions may have been favorable, the absence of direct evidence of life so far does not rule it out.\n\nThe search for life on Mars continues, with the European Space Agency's upcoming Exomars rover planned to investigate the planet's habitability in 2018.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

This comes after a decade-long legal battle between Nestlé, the maker of KitKat, and Mondelez, which owns Cadbury. Nestlé had attempted to trademark the unique shape of the KitKat, arguing that it was distinctive, but the court found that evidence was insufficient. The ruling means that the EU trademark office must reconsider the decision, potentially allowing for a change in the status of the KitKat shape. Other countries, like the UK, have their own trademark disputes, with Nestle successfully registering the Toblerone shape, and ongoing cases like the one involving Poundland's non-trademarked version of Toblerone.

Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long thought to roar with the ferocity of movie monsters, might have sounded more like birds, according to new research. The study published in the journal Evolution argues that the ancient reptiles, known as archosaurs, primarily used \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" which are low-throat sounds similar to those of modern birds. These sounds, unlike the high-pitched chirps of birds with open mouths, are produced by a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch. The researchers found that a significant portion of birds, particularly those with large bodies, have this ability, suggesting it evolved separately in dinosaurs as well.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the Jurassic Park movie, revealed that the sounds of the dinosaurs were created by blending real animal noises. For instance, the raptors' hissing was inspired by a goose's angry squawks, and the T. rex's roar was a combination of a horse's sound and a slowed-down baby elephant's. The study also suggests that dinosaurs, like some birds, might have had the ability to produce closed-mouth vocalizations, but it's unclear if they used them in the same way as some birds do.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations, which are produced by pushing air into the esophageal pouch, are less common in small-bodied birds compared to those with larger bodies. This could imply that dinosaurs, with their large body sizes, might have had similar vocal capabilities, particularly in sexually selected displays. However, there is no direct fossil evidence to confirm this, as dinosaur vocalizations remain a mystery.\n\nThe evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and crocodiles indicates that it's a relatively recent trait, having evolved independently in at least 16 different animal lineages. This suggests that the ability to produce these sounds might have been incorporated into dinosaur vocalizations, but without fossil evidence, the specifics remain uncertain.\n\nIn conclusion, while dinosaurs likely had unique vocalizations, the new findings suggest they might have sounded more akin to the cooing of a dove or the mumble of an ostrich, rather than the fearsome roars commonly portrayed in movies. Further research is needed to uncover the true sounds of these extinct creatures.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

This continuous, abstract reconstruction of visual experiences is a significant advancement over previous methods that could only reconstruct static images.\n\nThe study involved subjects lying motionless in an MRI machine, with their brain activity monitored. The researchers then used the data to create a computer algorithm that linked specific brain patterns to visual elements in the videos. When the subjects watched the same trailers again, the algorithm generated a reconstructed video based on the brain patterns, creating a surreal, continuous representation of their visual experiences.\n\nThe researchers believe this technology could one day enable the visualization of internal imagery, such as dreams and thoughts, without external stimulation.

However, the accuracy and legal implications of such a technology are still being explored.\n\nWhile the current technology is limited to reconstructing simple visual scenes, the researchers plan to delve deeper into understanding the brain's visual processing by examining more complex regions.

The probability of finding the plane at a particular location is updated as new information comes in, such as the likelihood of a crash caused by pilot error.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian techniques were used to locate the wreckage after a two-year search, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. The Bayesian approach allows for flexibility in adjusting to changing information and considering multiple scenarios simultaneously, overcoming limitations of traditional methods that may be overly influenced by initial assumptions.\n\nHowever, the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 faces additional complexities due to the new evidence suggesting a deliberate diversion, which complicates the Bayesian calculations. While Bayesian methods can be applied to refine search strategies, they may not be the best fit in every situation, as highlighted by statistician Brad Efron.

The additional time in prison was due to Egeland's guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and interstate failure to pay child support. Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Bradford criticized Egeland as a \"menace to society\" who manipulated his son for personal gain. The scheme involved submitting a fraudulent disability insurance application just a week before the staged shooting, which was detected and resulted in the amputation of Egeland's leg.

Back in 2009, Egeland was co-owner of an Oregon development company that defrauded banks out of $20 million in loans that he and a partner used to fund a lavish lifestyle. Facing prison, Egeland took out disability insurance and had his son aim for his legs. Egeland told police he'd been attacked after stopping to assist a pregnant driver, but investigators got suspicious when his pricey BMW, his wallet, and his cellphone weren't taken, the Idaho Statesman reports. Then they learned about his recent insurance, and the whole thing unravelled. Now Egeland is facing an extra 3 years and 10 months for his roadside scheme and had his leg amputated from the shotgun blast. Bradford called him a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist,\" the Oregonian reports, but Egeland—who is now on three medications for mental health—has cast his own judgment. \"What bothers me the most is my son—the pain is on him,'' he says. \"If I could take it all back, I would, but I can't.

{"pred": "On Wednesday evening, a car driven by Nabila Altahan, a passenger in the vehicle, experienced a near-mishap in Mendon, Massachusetts, due to a rapid response to a GPS unit's incorrect instruction. While driving westbound on Route 4, the Toyota Corolla suddenly left the road when the GPS, which had directed her to turn around, caused her to overreact and veer towards a telephone pole. As a result, the car was suspended from the guy wire of a telephone guy wire, according to State Police.\n\nThankfully, neither Altahan nor her passenger were injured in the incident. The police reported that the car had gone off the road when it attempted to follow the GPS's unexpected turn, causing the unusual situation. A witness, Ray Ault, who happened to be nearby, witnessed the driver跳出 the car as it was suspended and immediately called for help. The State Police and Rutland City Fire Department arrived promptly to handle the situation.\n\nIn summary, this incident highlights the importance of cautious adherence to GPS directions and the potential risks of overreacting to electronic navigation systems, ultimately reminding drivers to exercise caution and use common sense in unfamiliar or confusing situations.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP.

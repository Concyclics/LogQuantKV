The rectangular building, which was once a gathering place for feasts, has produced finds including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch.

The body was found lying in a foetal position, wearing an amber necklace, and will undergo scientific analysis to provide information on the child's gender, diet, and date of burial. The three-year Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, and others, aims to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.\n\nThe discoveries at Marden Henge and Wilsford henge are part of a larger excavation project, which has also uncovered finds such as flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch.

The trail, which spans 2,650 miles from California to Washington, has traditionally been a relatively quiet and remote wilderness experience, but the influx of new hikers is causing concerns about overcrowding and environmental impact.\n\nThe PCTA has implemented a permit system to manage the number of hikers on the trail, with a daily quota of 50 permits per day. However, this has not been enough to prevent overcrowding, with some sections of the trail reaching capacity during peak season. The increased traffic is causing environmental damage, including degraded vegetation and human waste, and is also putting a strain on essential services such as search and rescue operations.\n\nDespite the challenges, many hikers are drawn to the PCT for its natural beauty and transformative power. The trail has been shown to have a profound impact on those who hike it, with many reporting feelings of personal growth and renewal. The PCTA is working to promote responsible hiking practices and to educate hikers about the importance of leaving no trace and respecting the environment.\n\nIn addition to the PCT, there are other hiking trails in the United States that are experiencing increased popularity, including the Appalachian Trail and the John Muir Trail.

She was a member of the Countryside Alliance and was known for her strong opinions on a range of topics, including food, politics, and social issues. Despite her larger-than-life personality, Wright was also a complex and multifaceted individual who struggled with addiction and personal demons throughout her life.\n\nWright's death was met with tributes from the culinary world and beyond, with many praising her unique personality, her love of food, and her contributions to British television.

The tax adds 1.75 cents per ounce to sugary drinks, with the goal of reducing sugar consumption and raising revenue for the city. However, many argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and driving business out of the city.\n\nCostco, a major retailer, has seen a significant decline in sales of sugary drinks since the tax was implemented, with a case of Gatorade increasing in price by over 64%. The company has posted signs directing customers to its stores outside the city limits, where they can avoid the tax. This has led to a decline in sales and revenue for the city.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, as it does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages. Starbucks, which is headquartered in Seattle, has rejected the tax.\n\nThe city's policymakers have been accused of ignoring the lessons of other cities that have implemented similar taxes, such as Cook County, Illinois, which repealed its sweetened beverage tax after just two months due to public outcry. Seattle's tax has also been criticized for its administrative gaffes, including a decision to apply the tax to purchases made with federal food stamp benefits, which was later reversed.\n\nThe tax has also been met with resistance from local businesses, which are concerned about the impact on their bottom line. The Illinois Restaurant Association has said that the tax will further diminish already thin profit margins for restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, a bill has been introduced in the Washington state legislature to impose a similar tax statewide. However, some are skeptical that the tax will be effective in reducing sugar consumption and improving public health, and instead argue that it will simply drive business out of the state.\n\nOverall, the sweetened beverage tax in Seattle has been a contentious issue, with many arguing that it is a regressive and ineffective way to address public health concerns.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax.

FAS is the most common known cause of intellectual disability and is estimated to affect 2-5% of children in the United States and Western Europe.\n\n**Symptoms of FAS**\n\nThe symptoms of FAS can vary in severity and may include physical characteristics such as a small head size, short stature, and facial abnormalities. Behavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are also common. Cognitive impairments, including learning disabilities and intellectual disability, are also associated with FAS.\n\n**Prevention and Treatment**\n\nThe best way to prevent FAS is to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy.

The researchers analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers, and found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy had a higher risk of having a child with ADHD.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development. However, the study's lead author, Dr. Beate Ritz, emphasized that the findings do not show a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD, and that the study only found an \"interesting observed association.\" The study's authors also noted that the data suggests that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy is associated with higher risks.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked concerns among health experts, with some advising pregnant women to avoid taking acetaminophen frequently or for extended periods.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline stance, refusing to negotiate with House Republicans and urging President Barack Obama to veto any bill that includes changes to the ACA.\n\nThe shutdown would have significant consequences for the Washington D.C. region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors. According to estimates, the region could lose $200 million a day and over 700,000 jobs could be affected. The shutdown would also impact local businesses, with many federal contractors and employees staying home and not spending money in the local economy.\n\nThe shutdown would also have widespread ripple effects, including delays in the processing of federal benefits, the closure of national parks and monuments, and disruptions to the judicial system. Local governments are preparing for the worst, setting aside funds to mitigate the impact of a shutdown.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner is under pressure from his own party to take a harder stance on the ACA, while Senate Democrats are united in their refusal to accept changes to the law.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission is named after astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. The spacecraft will be launched in July 2018 and will take seven years to complete its journey, making 24 close flybys of the sun.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, while keeping the science instruments at room temperature. The spacecraft will also have a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to keep it safe.\n\nThe mission's objectives include tracing the energy behind solar wind, understanding the heating of the solar corona, and determining what accelerates the solar wind. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will fly within 9 solar radii of the sun's surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun before. The mission will also carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate carrying his message to the sun.\n\nThe spacecraft will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion, and will repeat that flyby of the perihelion routine 23 more times over its lifetime until 2025. The 20-day launch window opens on July 31, 2018, and the spacecraft will arrive at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to prep for launch.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is a historic mission that will revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its impact on the solar system.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Neiman Marcus apologized for the breach and said it did not believe customers' Social Security numbers or birth dates were compromised. The company has not publicly given an estimate of how many credit card numbers were stolen or how many customers were affected.\n\nThe breach at Neiman Marcus appears to have gone on for significantly longer than the widespread attack on Target, which compromised 40 million customers' credit and debit card information.

Neiman Marcus, on the other hand, did not disclose the breach until late last week, after facing inquiries from a journalist specializing in computer security.\n\nA 17-page report from a computer firm, iSight, provides new insight into the holiday hacking that endangered data for over 100 million customers. The report details the type of software used in the massive hack, how it was effective, and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist. The report does not draw conclusions on who is ultimately responsible for the attack, citing an active U.S. government investigation.\n\nThe report also reveals that the data breach was caused by a type of malware placed in a store's point-of-sale systems, and that the hackers used a \"hook\" to suck up information on transactions in the memory of the cash register system or the server that controls it. The report concludes that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cyber crooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach.\n\nThe holiday data breach at Target appears to be part of a broad and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers, according to a report prepared by federal and private investigators.

The discovery was made by a team of researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Dr. Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in reclassifying Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\nThe team used mathematical and computer modeling to identify the planet's existence, and believe it will be detected via telescope within the next five years. The discovery has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet, with some arguing that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Dr. Brown and his team argue that the solar system is better understood with eight dominant objects, and that Pluto's reclassification was necessary to avoid having to consider hundreds of other small worlds as planets.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked excitement about the possibility of finding life beyond our solar system.

The Warratyi rock-shelter, located about 550 kilometers north of Adelaide, contains a treasure trove of ancient artefacts, including burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, and the earliest known use of ochre in Australia. The site also provides evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and a large, extinct flightless bird.\n\nThe discovery pushes back the known timeline of human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by around 10,000 years, and suggests that humans were able to adapt to the harsh environment and develop innovative technologies, such as fine stone tools and bone technology, locally. The find challenges the assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe site was discovered by archaeologist Giles Hamm and his team, who used a combination of radiocarbon dating and optical dating to determine the age of the artefacts. The team found that the quartz grains from the site date back to around 44,000 years ago, while the radiocarbon dating of the burnt eggshells suggests that they are between 45,000 and 49,000 years old.\n\nThe discovery is significant not only for its age, but also for its implications for our understanding of the history of human settlement in Australia. It suggests that humans were able to expand out of the coastal regions and into the arid interior of the country much more quickly than previously thought, and that they were able to adapt to the harsh environment and develop innovative technologies to survive.\n\nThe find is also significant for its implications for the debate over the extinction of megafauna in Australia. The discovery of bones from Diprotodon optatum and the giant bird in the rock shelter suggests that early humans were interacting with these animals, and may have even hunted them. This challenges the assumption that climate change was the primary cause of the extinction of megafauna in Australia.\n\nOverall, the discovery of the Warratyi rock-shelter is a significant find that provides new insights into the history of human settlement in Australia and the extinction of megafauna.

{"pred": "A recent paper published on arXiv.org has revived the concept of a Russian astronomer, Nikolai Kardashev, who proposed three phases of galactic expansion, known as the \"three types\" of technologically advanced civilizations. According to the paper's author, Dan Hooper, harvesting energy from distant stars is not only the best way to increase a civilization's available resources but also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving a civilization alone in the vastness of space.\n\nThe paper suggests that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies, reel them in, and harvest their energy before those stars become inaccessible forever. This would be done by using a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" to hover around a star and beam energy back to a nearby planet.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960 and has since been featured in science fiction works such as Olaf Stapledon's novel \"Star Maker\" and Larry Niven's novel \"Ringworld.\" Dyson spheres would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, known as \"statites,\" which would hover in space and form a cloud around the star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe paper also suggests that advanced civilizations would be able to detect the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away from them, and that humans may not have the precise instruments yet to detect these signatures. However, it is hoped that astronomers will develop the necessary technology before our sun becomes another flaming marble in some distant civilization's collection.\n\nIn summary, the paper proposes that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies, harvest their energy, and use it to power their civilization, and that this could be detected by observing the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away from them.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Jon Stewart, a comedian and former MTV talk show host, brought a new tone and direction to the show. Initially, the show focused on making fun of the news, but Stewart soon shifted the focus to deconstructing the news-making process itself. The show's correspondents, including Steve Carell, Mo Rocca, and Nancy Walls Carell, were tasked with asking questions that were not only humorous but also insightful.\n\nThe show's early days were marked by a series of excursions to cover the 2000 presidential campaign, including a memorable segment where Steve Carell asked Senator John McCain a series of questions on his bus. This moment marked a turning point for the show, as it demonstrated the power of asking the right questions and poking holes in the political process.\n\nThe show's writers, including Ben Karlin and Kent Jones, worked to create a show that was both funny and informative. They drew inspiration from the news, but also from their own experiences and observations. The show's format, which blended comedy and journalism, was a departure from traditional news programs.\n\nThroughout its run, The Daily Show became known for its irreverent humor and its willingness to tackle tough topics. The show's correspondents, including Carell, Rocca, and Walls Carell, became household names, and the show's influence extended beyond the world of comedy to the world of politics and journalism.", "answers": ["Jon Stewart took over as host of the Daily Show in January 1999, but when did the program truly start becoming the Daily Show that legions of fans would come to love?

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show. Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment.

{"pred": "Scientists have made groundbreaking discoveries in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin, uncovering evidence of ancient human innovation and technological advancements dating back 320,000 years. The findings, published in three new studies, suggest that early humans in Africa were more advanced than previously thought, with a sophisticated understanding of technology, social networks, and symbolic expression.\n\nThe research reveals that the earliest Middle Stone Age tools, characterized by smaller, more specialized stone tools and the use of obsidian, emerged tens of thousands of years earlier than previously believed. The tools were made from raw materials sourced from distant locations, indicating a complex network of trade and exchange between different groups of people.\n\nThe discoveries also include evidence of the earliest known use of pigments, with red and black rocks being drilled and ground to extract color. This suggests that early humans used pigments symbolically, possibly for personal adornment or to convey social status.\n\nThe findings challenge the long-held view that modern human behavior, including symbolism, innovation, and art, emerged suddenly around 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that these behaviors developed gradually over time, with early humans adapting to changing environmental conditions and developing new technologies to cope with uncertainty.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of climate change in driving human innovation and technological advancement. The Olorgesailie Basin, which was once a floodplain, underwent significant environmental changes around 300,000 years ago, leading to the development of a vast arid grassland. This would have made life difficult for early humans, who needed to adapt or go extinct. The fact that they adapted technologically and culturally suggests that they were able to respond to changing environmental conditions and develop new ways of living.\n\nOverall, the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide a new perspective on the evolution of human behavior and technology, suggesting that early humans were more advanced and sophisticated than previously thought.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Kieran was born with bilateral microtia, a rare condition where the external ear is underdeveloped, and was also deaf. However, thanks to previous operations and a hearing aid, he has been able to hear. The surgery, led by consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The ears were then grafted onto his head under pockets of skin and shaped to match the contours of his head.\n\nThe procedure was primarily cosmetic, but it brings significant psychological benefits, as it can improve a child's confidence and self-esteem. Kieran's parents, David and Louise, were overjoyed with the result, saying it was a \"game-changer\" for their son. Kieran himself was thrilled, saying he wanted to look like his friends and be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\n\nThe surgery is not a new procedure, but it is still a major operation that requires careful planning and execution. The hospital performs about 40 of these operations each year, mostly to create one missing ear. However, advances in tissue engineering may soon make it possible to create new ears using stem cells from a child's own fat tissue, which could be less invasive and more effective.\n\nKieran will need a follow-up operation in six months to refine the shape of his ears, but he is already delighted with the result.

The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes. Prosin, meanwhile, says her group isn't stopping with the chimps and will also target the release of other animals.

The raid was part of an investigation into the company's use of illegally obtained wood, specifically ebony from Madagascar. The Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants, and the government is preparing to charge Gibson with trafficking in illegally obtained wood. The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims that the government has not provided clear evidence of wrongdoing and that the company's business has been severely impacted by the raid.\n\nThe Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, and the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood. However, Gibson denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with US and Malagasy law. The company has presented documents to support its claim and says it stopped importing wood from Madagascar in 2009.\n\nThe guitar industry is divided on the Lacey Act, with some, like Chris Martin of C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the law as a necessary measure to stop illegal logging. Others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature and the potential for guitar builders to be forced to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also had an impact on the trade in vintage instruments, with some dealers, like George Gruhn, warning that owners may be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the US. The government has tried to create exemptions for vintage instruments, but Gruhn says they are rife with delays and has nearly eliminated his business that deals with overseas buyers.\n\nThe EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the Lacey Act, saying that it is necessary to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that responsible sourcing of wood is important.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

{"pred": "NASA scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the history of Mars, revealing that the planet was once covered by a massive ocean that was at least a mile deep and covered nearly a fifth of its surface. The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was a significant factor in the planet's habitability and could have supported life. The discovery was made by analyzing the isotopic composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which showed that the planet had lost a vast amount of water over time.\n\nThe research suggests that the ocean was formed when water from the Martian polar caps and underground aquifers flowed onto the surface, creating a global ocean that was much deeper than previously thought. The ocean was likely to have been warm and wet, with temperatures similar to those on Earth, making it a prime candidate for supporting life.\n\nThe discovery is based on data collected by NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, which were used to map the Martian atmosphere and detect the presence of water vapor. The team found that the water vapor on Mars is enriched in deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, which is a sign of water loss over time.\n\nThe study's lead author, Geronimo Villanueva, said that the discovery of the ancient ocean opens up new possibilities for the search for life on Mars. \"Ultimately, we can conclude that this idea of an ocean covering 20% of the planet, which opens the idea of habitability and the evolution of life on the planet,\" he said.\n\nThe discovery is significant not only for its implications for the search for life on Mars but also for our understanding of the planet's history and evolution. It suggests that Mars was once a much more Earth-like planet, with a warm and wet climate, and that the loss of its atmosphere and water was a key factor in its transformation into the cold and barren planet we see today.\n\nThe study's findings are supported by other research, including data from NASA's Curiosity rover, which has found evidence of ancient lakes and rivers on Mars. The discovery of the ancient ocean is a major breakthrough in our understanding of Mars and its potential for supporting life, and it raises new questions about the possibility of life existing on the Red Planet in the past or present.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

He charms.\" There's also \"combustible chemistry\" between Smith and Robbie, but the movie just \"disappoints,\" Rea writes. \"Even if you're willing to forgive its sinkhole plotholes and farthest-fetched conceits, the film ... ultimately makes no sense.\" Betsy Sharkey, on the other hand, says this \"rom-com-con\" is \"an irresistible reminder of all the reasons we first fell for the Fresh Prince so many years ago.\" Writing at the Los Angeles Times, she notes the romantic role of Nicky fits Smith perfectly, while Robbie is \"more than holding her own\" as his match. \"The scams are Rubik's Cube complicated, but what keeps you guessing is whether the romantic connection between Jess and Nicky is real or just another con.\" But Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle isn't convinced. In a review titled \"Will Smith just stole $12 from your pocket,\" he argues Focus is \"ridiculous in every detail.

This decision could lead to the end of KitKat's protected status in Europe and allow other companies to produce similar products.\n\nThe case has been ongoing for over a decade, with Nestle and Mondelez (the owner of Cadbury) disputing the trademark.

Researchers analyzed the vocalizations of birds and found that many species make sounds with their beaks closed, known as closed-mouth vocalizations. This behavior is often used for mating and territorial displays, and is more common in larger bird species. The study suggests that this behavior may have evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups, and found that 52 out of 208 investigated bird species use this behavior. They also found that only animals with a relatively large body size, such as doves and ostriches, use closed-mouth vocalization.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur vocalizations. Since dinosaurs are members of the archosaur group and many had large body sizes, it is likely that some dinosaurs made closed-mouthed vocalizations, perhaps during mating displays. However, there is currently no direct fossil evidence to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the sounds made by dinosaurs may have been more like the coos of doves or the hisses of geese, rather than the roars depicted in movies.

The researchers plan to continue their research, aiming to build models for every part of the visual system and improve the resolution of the reconstructed videos.\n\nWhile the technology is still in its early stages, it has the potential to be used in a variety of applications, including allowing people to control their environment, reading people's memories, and even potentially watching their dreams.

The problem is not limited to adults, with obesity rates rising nearly 50% in children and adolescents worldwide.\n\nThe report's authors suggest that the availability of cheap, high-calorie foods and sedentary lifestyles are contributing factors to the growing obesity epidemic. They also note that there is no country that has successfully reduced its obesity rate over the past 30 years.\n\nThe World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and suggest solutions. The report's findings highlight the need for a global effort to address this growing public health crisis.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

The Brotherhood has already won a plurality of seats in the first two rounds, and its candidates are strong in the nine provinces voting in the final round. The party's leader, Essam el-Erian, has said that while the Brotherhood may win more than half the seats, it does not plan to form an all-Islamist government and will instead seek to form a coalition with other parties.\n\nMeanwhile, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak has resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing Mubarak of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensuring his son Gamal would succeed him. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the uprising that forced him from office, and could face the death penalty if convicted. His two sons, Alaa and Gamal, are also on trial, facing corruption charges.\n\nThe elections and Mubarak's trial come amid growing opposition to the ruling military council, which has been criticized for its handling of the transition to democracy. Protesters are planning to take to the streets on January 25 to mark the anniversary of the uprising that ousted Mubarak, and there are concerns about the potential for violence.\n\nEconomic growth has slowed in Egypt, with foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% and the stock market losing 49% of its value last year.

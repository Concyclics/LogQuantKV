A study published in the journal Infection and Immunity found that cigarette smoke exposure makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive, allowing it to evade the immune system and cause more severe infections.\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that cigarette smoke exposure alters the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are used by the immune system to kill pathogens. This increased resistance allows MRSA to survive and thrive, making it more difficult to treat and potentially leading to more severe infections.\n\nThe study also found that cigarette smoke exposure makes MRSA more resistant to macrophages, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting infections. In fact, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that cigarette smoke exposure also makes MRSA more aggressive, allowing it to invade human cells more easily and cause more damage.

The charity is also calling on international donors to prioritize funding for these efforts, as it is more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution.\n\nThe organization is optimistic that the practice of institutionalization can be eradicated by 2050, and is working with governments and other organizations to make this goal a reality.

The body was found lying in a foetal position, wearing an amber necklace, and will undergo scientific analysis to provide information on the child's gender, diet, and date of burial. The three-year dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, and other organizations, aims to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.\n\nThe discoveries at Marden Henge and Wilsford henge are part of a larger excavation project in the Vale of Pewsey, which has already produced a range of finds, including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and copper bracelets.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years.

However, the researchers emphasize that the study does not mean that pregnant women should never take acetaminophen, but rather that they should avoid chronic or long-term use.

The article highlights the fleeting nature of power and how circumstances can change rapidly, leading to a loss of status and reputation.\n\nThe article provides examples of five individuals who have fallen from grace, including Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House Communications Director who was fired after just 11 days in the role. Scaramucci's tenure was marked by controversy, including a profanity-laced interview with The New Yorker and a tumultuous relationship with then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.\n\nAnother example is Chris Christie, the former Governor of New Jersey, who has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the state's history. Christie's reputation was damaged by the Bridgegate scandal, in which allies created a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge to punish a local Democratic mayor. Christie's approval ratings plummeted, and he was eventually replaced by Mike Pence as head of Trump's transition team.\n\nJames Comey, the former Director of the FBI, was fired by President Trump in May 2017. Comey's tenure was marked by controversy, including his decision to publicly criticize Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and his investigation into her campaign. Trump's decision to fire Comey was widely criticized, and the White House provided multiple conflicting justifications for the move.\n\nMark Fields, the former CEO of Ford Motor Company, was fired in May 2017 after failing to inspire confidence on Wall Street.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission is named after astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. The spacecraft will be launched in July 2018 and will take seven years to complete its mission, during which it will make 24 close flybys of the sun.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from temperatures of up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, while keeping its science instruments at room temperature. The spacecraft will also have a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to keep it safe.\n\nThe mission's objectives include tracing the energy behind solar wind, understanding the heating of the solar corona, and determining what accelerates the solar wind. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will fly within 9 solar radii of the sun's surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun before. The mission will also carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate with an inscription of his choice.\n\nThe spacecraft will be launched on a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center and will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion, or closest point to the sun. The mission is expected to end in 2025.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is a historic mission that will revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its impact on the solar system.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The discovery was made by a team of researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Dr. Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in reclassifying Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\nThe team used mathematical and computer modeling to identify the planet's existence, and believe it will be detected via telescope within the next five years. The discovery has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet, with some arguing that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Dr. Brown and his team argue that the solar system is better understood with eight dominant objects, and that Pluto's demotion was necessary to establish a clear definition of a planet.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked excitement about the possibility of discovering new types of objects in the outer reaches of the solar system.

Cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation can cause the arteries to narrow, leading to chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.

As Dr. Bangalore noted, \"Our findings suggest that we need to be concerned about weight fluctuation in this group that is already at high risk due to coronary disease.

{"pred": "A recent paper published on arXiv.org has revived the concept of a Russian astronomer, Nikolai Kardashev, who proposed three phases of galactic expansion, known as the \"three types\" of technologically advanced civilizations. According to the paper's author, Dan Hooper, harvesting energy from distant stars is not only the best way to increase a civilization's available resources but also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving a civilization alone in the vastness of space.\n\nThe paper suggests that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies, reel them in, and harvest their energy before they become inaccessible forever. This would be done by using a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" to hover around a star and beam energy back to a nearby planet.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960 and has since been featured in science fiction works such as Olaf Stapledon's novel \"Star Maker\" and Larry Niven's novel \"Ringworld.\" Dyson spheres would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, which would remain in place by balancing against the pressure of light from the sun.\n\nThe paper also suggests that advanced civilizations would be able to detect the unusual light signatures of galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away from them, and that humans may not have the technology to detect these signatures yet. However, it is hoped that astronomers will develop the necessary instruments to detect these signs of advanced civilizations before our sun becomes another flaming marble in some distant civilization's collection.\n\nIn summary, the paper proposes that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies, harvest their energy, and use it to power their own civilization, and that this could be detected by observing the unusual light signatures of galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away from them.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Initially, the show focused on satirizing the conventions of traditional news programs, but it soon shifted its focus to deconstructing the political process and the media's role in it.\n\nStewart's early days as host were marked by tension with the existing staff, who were resistant to change. He brought in new writers and correspondents, including Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert, and Mo Rocca, who would become key players in the show's success.\n\nThe show's breakthrough moment came in December 1999, when Steve Carell asked Senator John McCain a question on his bus during the presidential campaign, which was met with an uncomfortable silence. This moment marked a turning point for the show, as it began to focus on asking tough questions and challenging the status quo in politics.\n\nThe show's correspondents, including Carell, Colbert, and Rocca, became known for their irreverent and humorous approach to reporting, often poking fun at the conventions of traditional journalism. The show's success was marked by its ability to balance humor and insight, making it a unique and influential force in the world of political satire.\n\nThroughout its run, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart became known for its biting commentary on politics and the media, and its ability to make complex issues accessible and entertaining. The show's impact was felt far beyond its own audience, influencing the way people thought about politics and the media, and paving the way for future generations of satirists and comedians.", "answers": ["Jon Stewart took over as host of the Daily Show in January 1999, but when did the program truly start becoming the Daily Show that legions of fans would come to love? Try December of that year, when Steve Carell boarded John McCain's campaign bus \"and changed the entire trajectory\" of the show, writes Chris Smith at Vanity Fair. The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show. Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them.\" Head writer Ben Karlin: \"I remember seeing it in the editing room. I remember Jon called me down, and seeing it and thinking, Yeah, this is what we should be doing. This is the goal. It was one of Carell’s most incredible moments.

In Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin, researchers have uncovered evidence of advanced toolmaking and trading networks dating back 320,000 years, which is tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought. The findings suggest that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments and develop complex social networks, which allowed them to thrive in a challenging climate.\n\nThe discoveries include the oldest known stone tools, which were used for tasks such as chopping down branches and carving up carcasses. The tools were made from obsidian, a volcanic glass that was transported from as far as 25-50 kilometers away. The researchers also found evidence of pigment use, with red and black rocks that were drilled into to extract color.\n\nThe findings suggest that early humans were able to develop complex technologies and social networks, which allowed them to survive and thrive in a challenging environment. The discoveries also challenge the traditional view of the \"human revolution,\" which posits that modern human behavior and technology emerged suddenly around 40,000-50,000 years ago.\n\nInstead, the new evidence suggests that complex behaviors and technologies emerged gradually over time, with early humans adapting to changing environments and developing new tools and social networks. The discoveries also highlight the importance of climate change and environmental factors in shaping human evolution and behavior.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the emergence of modern human behavior.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Many have expressed concerns about the quality of sound and the inconvenience of using wireless headphones. Some have also pointed out that the decision is not about technological advancement, but rather about Apple's desire to sell more accessories and increase profits.\n\nThe article also highlights the inconvenience of using wireless headphones, citing the example of the author's own experience with Bluetooth headphones.

Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

Kieran was born with bilateral microtia, a rare condition where the external ear is underdeveloped, and was also deaf. However, thanks to previous operations and a hearing aid, he has been able to hear. The surgery, led by consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The ears were then grafted onto his head under pockets of skin and shaped to match the contours of his head.\n\nThe procedure was primarily cosmetic, but it brings significant psychological benefits, as it can improve a child's confidence and self-esteem. Kieran's parents, David and Louise, were overjoyed with the result, saying it was a \"game-changer\" for their son. Kieran himself was thrilled, saying he wanted to look like his friends and be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\n\nThe surgery is not a new procedure, but it is still a major operation that requires careful planning and execution. The hospital performs about 40 of these operations each year, mostly to create one missing ear. However, advances in tissue engineering may soon make it possible to create new ears using stem cells from a child's own fat tissue, which could be less invasive and more effective.\n\nKieran will need a follow-up operation in six months to make his ears stand out from his scalp more, but he is already delighted with the result.

The raid is believed to be related to the company's alleged trafficking in illegally obtained wood, specifically ebony from Madagascar. The Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants, and the government is preparing to charge Gibson with violating this law. The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims that the government has not provided clear evidence of wrongdoing and that the company's business has been severely impacted by the raid.\n\nThe Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, and the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood. However, Gibson denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with US and Malagasy law. The company has presented documents to support its claim and asserts that the seized wood was legally obtained from India.\n\nThe guitar industry is divided on the Lacey Act, with some, like Chris Martin of C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the law as a necessary measure to stop illegal logging. Others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature and the potential for guitar builders to be forced to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also had a significant impact on the trade in vintage instruments, with some dealers, like George Gruhn, warning of the potential for owners to be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the US. The EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the law, stating that it is intended to reduce illegal logging and promote responsible wood sourcing.\n\nThe case against Gibson is ongoing, with the company awaiting charges and a day in court.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

{"pred": "NASA scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the history of Mars, revealing that a massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the planet's northern hemisphere. The ocean, which was at least a mile deep in some areas, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding challenges previous theories that Mars was a dry and barren planet, and instead suggests that it was once a warm and wet world with a habitable environment.\n\nThe discovery was made by analyzing the isotopic composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which revealed that the planet's water has been depleted over time. The team used powerful telescopes to study the atmosphere and found that the concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, is much higher on Mars than on Earth. This suggests that Mars lost a significant amount of water to space, which would have formed an ocean that covered a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe scientists estimate that the ocean would have been at least 137 meters deep, and possibly much deeper, and would have been a major factor in shaping the planet's geology and climate. The finding also raises the possibility that life could have existed on Mars in the past, as the ocean would have provided a habitable environment.\n\nThe discovery is based on data collected by NASA's Curiosity rover, which has been exploring Mars since 2012. The rover has found evidence of ancient lakes, rivers, and deltas on the planet, and has detected methane in the atmosphere, which could be a sign of microbial life.\n\nThe study's lead author, Geronimo Villanueva, said that the discovery of the ancient ocean opens up new possibilities for the search for life on Mars. \"Ultimately, we can conclude that this idea of an ocean covering 20% of the planet, which opens the idea of habitability and the evolution of life on the planet,\" he said.\n\nThe finding is also supported by other studies, including one published in 2014 that suggested that the early Martian atmosphere was rich in heavy hydrogen and that much of it escaped into space. This would have led to a greater loss of water from the planet, and would have formed a larger ocean.\n\nOverall, the discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars is a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the planet's history and raises the possibility that life could have existed on the Red Planet in the past.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The study's authors suggest that this behavior may have also been present in some non-avian dinosaurs, particularly those with large body sizes.\n\nThe study's findings are based on an analysis of the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and other reptilian groups. The researchers found that 52 out of 208 bird species use this behavior, and that it is more common in larger birds. They also found that the ability to make closed-mouth vocalizations is associated with large body size, which may be due to the physical challenges of inflating an elastic cavity.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that the ancestors of modern archosaurs, which include birds and crocodiles, may have vocalized in a similar way.

The report shows that top officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, knew that the attack was a terrorist attack from the beginning, but instead blamed it on a video and a protest. The report also criticizes Clinton for not adequately addressing concerns about growing extremism in Libya and for falsely blaming the violence on an anti-Muslim video.\n\nThe report is based on a two-hour video teleconference call between White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, Clinton, and other officials, which was held on the night of the attack. During the call, officials discussed the attack and the need to respond to it, but also spent a significant amount of time discussing the anti-Islam video and its potential role in the attack.\n\nThe report also reveals that Clinton and other officials knew that the attack was not a protest, but rather a well-planned terrorist attack. This is in contrast to the public narrative that was presented at the time, which suggested that the attack was a spontaneous response to the video.\n\nThe report has been met with criticism from Democrats, who have accused the committee of being partisan and of trying to politicize the investigation. Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, has said that the report is \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" and that it is \"very partisan.\"\n\nThe report is the culmination of a two-year investigation into the Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress.

The magazine includes an exclusive report on Tom Cruise's emotional letter to ex-wife Katie Holmes, in which he expresses his feelings and hopes for a reconciliation. The couple divorced in July last year after 12 months of marriage, but friends say Cruise has been thinking about Katie a lot recently and has written a heartfelt letter to her. The letter is said to be a genuine expression of his feelings and a desire to rekindle their friendship, if not more. Sources close to the former Dawson's Creek star say Katie has been \"genuinely touched\" by the letter and has been given a glimpse of the romantic Tom she fell in love with.\n\nIn other news, the Royal Bodyguard has warned that Kate Middleton's baby is in danger, and LOOK magazine has picked out the key trends to start wearing now.

{"pred": "Egypt is holding its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its gains and potentially win a majority of seats. The Brotherhood has already won a plurality of seats in the first two rounds, and its leader, Essam el-Erian, has said that the party may not win more than half the seats. The Brotherhood has also downplayed its electoral strength, saying it will form a coalition government to avoid unnerving Egyptian liberals and Westerners.\n\nMeanwhile, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak has resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing Mubarak of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensure his son, Gamal, would succeed him. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the uprising that forced him out of office. His two sons, Alaa and Gamal, face corruption charges, and Mubarak could face the death penalty if convicted.\n\nThe election and Mubarak's trial come amid growing opposition to the ruling generals, who say they will not cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June. The new parliament is expected to be formed on January 23, but it is unclear what powers it will have and how a new government will be formed.\n\nThe economy has slowed due to the unrest, with foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% and the stock market losing 49% of its value last year. The country is also facing a shortage of basic goods, including fuel and food.\n\nThe Brotherhood's potential majority in parliament could lead to a confrontation with the military rulers, who have said they will retain significant power and allocate very little to the parliament. The Brotherhood has said it will form a coalition government, but winning a majority would enable it to govern without a coalition and reduce the power of other parties.\n\nThe trial of Mubarak and his associates is expected to continue for several days, with the prosecution presenting its case against the former president and his sons. The trial is a reminder to future rulers that they will be held accountable for breaking the law, and it is seen as a key test of the country's transition to democracy.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

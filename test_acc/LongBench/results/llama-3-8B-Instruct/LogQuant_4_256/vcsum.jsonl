The moderator then opened the floor for questions and asked if any of the students had any questions. One student asked about the black hole photo, specifically why it was possible to see it even though it was not taken in the visible light spectrum. The speaker explained that the visible light spectrum is not suitable for observing the center of the galaxy because of the large amount of dust and gas present, which would block the light. However, other wavelengths such as radio, millimeter, and X-ray can penetrate through this material and allow us to observe the black hole.\n\nAnother student asked why we can still see the photo even though it was not taken in the visible light spectrum. The speaker explained that the photo was actually taken in the infrared or submillimeter waveband, but it was mapped to the visible light spectrum using a process called \"color mapping\". This process involves assigning different colors to different wavelengths of light, allowing us to visualize the data in a way that is easier to understand.\n\nA third student asked about the color bar on the photo, which represents the brightness of the object. The speaker explained that the color bar is a representation of the intensity of the radiation emitted by the object, and that it can be used to represent the temperature of the particles emitting the radiation. The speaker also mentioned that the photo was taken at a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters, which is not visible to the human eye, but it shows the distribution of radiation intensity at different locations.\n\nOverall, the meeting discussed the challenges of observing the center of the galaxy and the techniques used to overcome these challenges, including the use of different wavelengths of light and color mapping.", "answers": ["黑洞是看不到的，我们所观测的是黑洞的光谱进行后期处理后所散发的辐射，黑洞的中心密度远大于外圈，越大的黑洞越难进行撕裂，黑洞的存在时长是可以从周围的环境进行判断，人造黑洞是有可行性的但需要很精准的数据，民间爱好者想要参与对黑洞的探索也可以与国家天文台进行合作，黑洞转化为暗物质有着一定的可行性，古今以来我们对天体和黑洞的探索一直没有中断，以后会更加积极地去填补空白部分。"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1248}

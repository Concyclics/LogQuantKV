The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to the price of sugary drinks, was intended to reduce sugar consumption and raise revenue for the city. However, many have argued that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and small businesses.\n\nOne of the most notable examples of the tax's impact is the response of Costco, a mega-retailer with a location in Seattle. The company has posted signs directing customers to its suburban locations, where they can avoid the tax. This has led to a significant decline in sales of sugary drinks in Seattle, with many customers opting to shop outside the city instead.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of effectiveness in achieving its stated goals. Proponents of the tax argued that it would reduce sugar consumption and improve public health, but the evidence suggests that people are simply finding ways to circumvent the tax, such as shopping in neighboring cities.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the tax has also led to calls for a statewide version of the tax in Washington state.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The probe will be protected by a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite shield and will have to withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The mission aims to answer questions about the sun's corona, the solar wind, and the acceleration of particles in the sun's atmosphere. The probe will also carry a heat shield to protect it from the sun's heat and will have a solar array to generate power. The mission is expected to last for 7 years and will provide new insights into the sun's behavior and the solar wind.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

{"pred": "A team of scientists has revived a 1962 concept by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, which proposes that a civilization can harness energy from distant stars to become a universal power. According to the concept, a civilization would first harvest energy from its own planet, then its star, and finally, all the stars in its galaxy. The civilization would then expand to other galaxies, allowing it to grow and thrive. The concept has been revived with a new twist, suggesting that a civilization would need to harvest energy from distant stars to prevent the universe from expanding and leaving them behind.\n\nThe concept of harvesting energy from distant stars is not new, and has been proposed by scientists such as Carl Sagan and Freeman Dyson. However, a new study suggests that this concept could be used to detect the presence of alien civilizations. The study proposes that a civilization would need to harvest energy from distant stars to power their own civilization, and that this energy would be detectable through changes in the light emitted by the stars.\n\nThe study also suggests that a civilization would need to be able to detect the presence of other civilizations, and that this could be done by looking for changes in the light emitted by the stars. The study concludes that the detection of alien civilizations is possible, and that it could be done by looking for changes in the light emitted by the stars.\n\nIn addition to the study, there are also several science fiction stories that have explored the concept of harvesting energy from distant stars. For example, the 1937 novel \"Star Maker\" by Olaf Stapledon describes a civilization that has harnessed the energy of its star, and the 1960 novel \"Dune\" by Frank Herbert describes a civilization that has harnessed the energy of its planet.\n\nOverall, the concept of harvesting energy from distant stars is an interesting and thought-provoking idea that has been explored in both science and science fiction.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The findings suggest that the climate and environment were changing rapidly, with frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions, which would have made it difficult for early humans to adapt. To cope with these changes, humans likely developed new tools and technologies, such as smaller, more specialized stone tools made from obsidian, a volcanic glass, which was transported from as far away as 50 kilometers. The obsidian was used to make tools, such as spear points and blades, which were likely used for hunting and gathering. The team also found evidence of the use of pigments, such as red ochre, which was used to color rocks and possibly for symbolic purposes.\n\nThe discoveries suggest that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments and develop new technologies, which allowed them to survive and thrive.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, Australia, and the western United States, with the best views from eastern Europe and North America.\n\nThe total eclipse will last for 77 minutes, during which the moon will take on a reddish hue due to the Earth's atmosphere. This event is rare, with the next occurrence of a Blue Moon eclipse not happening until December 31, 2037.\n\nIn addition to the eclipse, the moon will also appear as a Supermoon, which is a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

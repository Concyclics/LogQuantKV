The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to the price of sugary drinks, was intended to reduce consumption and raise revenue for the city. However, many have argued that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and small businesses.\n\nRetailers have responded by posting signs directing customers to nearby cities where the tax does not apply, and some have even adjusted their prices to reflect the tax. Costco, a major retailer in the area, has seen a significant decline in sales of sugary drinks since the tax went into effect. The company has also posted signs directing customers to its stores outside of Seattle where the tax does not apply.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of effectiveness in achieving its stated goals. Proponents of the tax argued that it would reduce consumption of sugary drinks and improve public health, but many have pointed out that the tax has not had the desired effect. In fact, many residents have simply adjusted their shopping habits to avoid the tax, buying their sugary drinks in nearby cities.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the tax has also led to calls for its repeal. Some have argued that the tax is an example of overreach by government, and that it is an ineffective way to achieve public health goals. Others have pointed out that the tax is regressive and disproportionately affects low-income families.\n\nIn related news, a bill has been introduced in the Washington state legislature to impose a similar tax on sugary drinks statewide. The bill has been met with opposition from some lawmakers and business owners, who argue that it would be a burden on small businesses and consumers.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

She claimed that the app was an invasion of her privacy and likened it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet.

The study found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods or later in pregnancy had a higher risk of their children developing ADHD-like behaviors.\n\nExperts caution that the study's findings are not conclusive and that more research is needed to understand the relationship between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and ADHD in children. They also note that acetaminophen is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy, but that women should weigh the risks and benefits of taking the medication and consider alternative pain relief methods, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture.\n\nThe study's findings are important because ADHD is a growing concern, with over 10% of children in the United States diagnosed with the condition.

The study, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011. The results showed that younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer and were more likely to undergo surgery and radiation therapy. Despite this, younger patients had a slightly better five-year survival rate than older patients.\n\nThe study suggests that the current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening may need to be revised to include younger patients. Dr. Hendren notes that the findings are a \"wake-up call\" for the medical community to start screening for colorectal cancer in patients under 50. The study also highlights the importance of early detection and treatment, as well as the need for more research on the causes of the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients.\n\nExperts agree that the findings are concerning, but some argue that it is too early to say whether the guidelines should be changed. Dr. David Weinberg, chairman of medicine at the Fox Chase Cancer Center, notes that the study is a \"wake-up call\" and that the medical community needs to be more aware of the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The discovery was made by analyzing the composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which showed a significant enrichment of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThe team used data from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope to study the atmospheric maps of Mars, which revealed a high concentration of deuterium in the water vapor. This suggests that the ocean on Mars was much deeper and more extensive than previously thought, covering an area of about 20% of the planet's surface.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for the search for life on Mars, as they suggest that the planet was once warm and wet, with conditions that could have supported life.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

The decision means that the EU's trademark office will have to reconsider its decision to grant Nestle the trademark.\n\nThe dispute began in 2002, when Nestle applied for a trademark for the shape of the Kit Kat bar. Mondelez, which owns the Cadbury brand, opposed the application, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be protected. The EU's trademark office granted the trademark in 2006, but Mondelez appealed the decision, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be recognized across the entire EU.\n\nThe case has been ongoing for over a decade, with the EU's highest court finally ruling in favor of Mondelez. The decision means that the Kit Kat shape is no longer protected as a trademark in the EU, and other companies can now produce their own four-fingered chocolate bars without infringing on Nestle's rights.\n\nThe ruling has implications for the chocolate industry, as it sets a precedent for the protection of trademarks across the EU.

The study, published in the journal Evolution, found that many birds make sounds with their closed mouths, which are often low-pitched and used for mating or territorial displays. The researchers analyzed the vocalizations of over 200 bird species and found that large-bodied birds, such as ostriches and cassowaries, are more likely to make closed-mouth sounds. They also found that the ability to make closed-mouth sounds has evolved independently in different groups of animals, including birds, crocodiles, and dinosaurs.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, said that the results suggest that dinosaurs may have made similar sounds, perhaps using their vocal cords or esophageal pouches to produce low-pitched sounds. The researchers also found that the ability to make closed-mouth sounds is more common in large-bodied animals, which may have been a factor in the evolution of this behavior in dinosaurs.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and communication.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

{"pred": "A new report by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington has revealed that obesity is a growing global problem, affecting nearly 30% of the world's population. The report, published in the Lancet medical journal, analyzed data from 188 countries and found that the number of overweight or obese individuals has increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013. This represents a staggering 47% increase over the past three decades.\n\nThe report highlights that obesity is not just a problem in developed countries, but also in developing countries, where it is rising rapidly. In fact, the majority of the world's obese population lives in developing countries, with the highest rates found in the Middle East and North Africa. The report also notes that obesity is not just a problem for adults, but also affects children and adolescents, with rates increasing by 47% in this age group over the past three decades.\n\nThe report suggests that the main causes of obesity are increased calorie intake, changes in diet composition, and decreased physical activity. It also notes that the rise of junk food and sedentary lifestyles has contributed to the problem. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study the issue and find solutions.\n\nThe report concludes that obesity is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality, and that it is essential to address this issue to improve public health.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

The party has already won a majority of the seats in the first two rounds of voting, and is expected to continue its momentum in the final round. The Brotherhood has played down its chances of winning a majority, but analysts believe it is likely to win a significant number of seats.\n\nThe elections are taking place amid a backdrop of political turmoil, with the military rulers of the country facing growing criticism for their handling of the transition to democracy. The military has said it will not cede power until after presidential elections are held in June, which has led to tensions between the military and the Brotherhood.\n\nThe trial of former President Hosni Mubarak is also ongoing, with prosecutors accusing him of being responsible for the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the uprising that led to his ouster. Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also on trial, facing charges of corruption and abuse of power.\n\nThe Brotherhood has been working to build alliances with other political parties and groups, including the liberal and left-wing parties, in an effort to form a coalition government. However, the military has said it will not allow the Brotherhood to take control of the government, and has instead vowed to maintain its own control over the country.\n\nThe economy is also struggling, with tourism and investment declining significantly since the uprising. The country's foreign currency reserves have declined by 44% in the past year, and the stock market has lost nearly 50% of its value.\n\nOverall, the situation in Egypt is complex and uncertain, with many different factions vying for power and influence.

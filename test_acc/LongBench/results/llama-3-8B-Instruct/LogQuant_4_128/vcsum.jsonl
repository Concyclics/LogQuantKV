The moderator then opened the floor for questions and asked if any of the students had any questions. One student asked about the black hole photo, specifically why it was possible to see it even though it was not taken in the visible light spectrum. The speaker explained that the visible light spectrum is not suitable for observing the center of the galaxy because of the large amount of dust and gas present, which would block the light. However, other wavelengths such as radio, millimeter, and X-ray can penetrate through this material and allow us to observe the black hole.\n\nAnother speaker added that the photo was taken in the 1.3 millimeter wavelength and the color represents the brightness of the radiation. The color bar on the side of the image shows the corresponding brightness levels, with darker colors indicating lower brightness and lighter colors indicating higher brightness. The speaker explained that the color is not a direct representation of the object's temperature, but rather a representation of the radiation intensity, which is related to the energy of the particles.\n\nOverall, the discussion focused on the challenges of observing the center of the galaxy and the importance of using different wavelengths to overcome these challenges.", "answers": ["黑洞是看不到的，我们所观测的是黑洞的光谱进行后期处理后所散发的辐射，黑洞的中心密度远大于外圈，越大的黑洞越难进行撕裂，黑洞的存在时长是可以从周围的环境进行判断，人造黑洞是有可行性的但需要很精准的数据，民间爱好者想要参与对黑洞的探索也可以与国家天文台进行合作，黑洞转化为暗物质有着一定的可行性，古今以来我们对天体和黑洞的探索一直没有中断，以后会更加积极地去填补空白部分。"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1248}

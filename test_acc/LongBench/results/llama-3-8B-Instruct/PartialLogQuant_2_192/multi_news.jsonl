According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, cigarette smoke has been found to make MRSA more resistant to antimicrobial defenses, allowing it to thrive and cause more harm to the body.\n\nResearchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, discovered that cigarette smoke alters the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species. This means that the bacteria can better evade the immune system and cause more severe infections.\n\nThe study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. Additionally, the bacteria became better at adhering to human cells, making it easier for them to invade and cause disease.\n\nThe researchers suggest that cigarette smoke may be an additional contributing factor to the increasing prevalence of MRSA infections, particularly in smokers. This is concerning, as MRSA is a highly resistant bacteria that can cause life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia, skin infections, and bloodstream infections.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of refraining from smoking, as it not only harms the smoker's own health but also contributes to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The researchers hope that their findings will provide another reason for individuals to quit smoking and reduce the risk of MRSA infections.\n\nIn related news, a previous study published in the same journal found that e-cigarette vapor also altered the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to antimicrobial defenses.

Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The probe will be protected by a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite shield and will have to withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The mission aims to answer questions about the sun's corona, the solar wind, and the acceleration of particles in the sun's atmosphere. The probe will also carry a heat shield to protect it from the sun's heat and will have a solar array to generate power. The mission is expected to last for 7 years and will provide new insights into the sun's behavior and the solar wind.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Its story notes that while Bush served just one term as president, it was a consequential one. \"The Berlin Wall fell; the Soviet Union ceased to exist; the communist bloc in Eastern Europe broke up; the Cold War ended.\" And Bush's \"firm, restrained diplomatic sense helped assure the harmony and peace with which these world-shaking events played out, one after the other.\" Great detail: In its obituary, the Wall Street Journal notes that Bush flew 58 missions in the Pacific as a Navy pilot in WWII, all with the name of his girlfriend—Barbara—on the side of the plane. He once got shot down, with this video capturing the rescue. Bush is also the only American besides John Adams to be both president and the father of a president.

{"pred": "O.J. Simpson, the former football star and actor, is set to appear before a Nevada parole board on October 1 to plead his case for release from prison. Simpson has been serving a 9-33 year sentence for a 2007 robbery conviction, and is now eligible for parole. If granted, he could be released as early as October 1.\n\nSimpson was acquitted of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1994, but was later found liable for their deaths in a civil trial. He was also convicted of armed robbery and kidnapping in 2008 and sentenced to 9-33 years in prison.\n\nThe parole board will consider Simpson's behavior in prison, as well as his remorse for the crimes he committed. Simpson has expressed regret for the incident and has been a model prisoner, according to his lawyer. The board will also consider the views of the victims' families, who have expressed opposition to Simpson's release.\n\nSimpson's parole hearing is highly anticipated, with many media outlets and the public expected to follow the proceedings. The hearing will be held via video conference, with Simpson appearing from Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada.\n\nIn his 2013 parole hearing, Simpson expressed his desire to be released and start a new life. He has also spoken publicly about his regret for the 2007 robbery, saying he wishes he had never gone through with it.\n\nThe outcome of the parole hearing is uncertain, but if granted, Simpson would be eligible for release from prison.", "answers": ["OJ Simpson's parole hearing in Nevada will be broadcast live at 1pm EDT Thursday and there's a strong chance that his path to freedom will be clear by the end of the afternoon. Nobody has registered to testify against the 70-year-old Simpson, who has been in prison for nine years on 12 convictions related to a Las Vegas robbery and will appear before the Nevada Parole Board via videolink, NPR reports. Thursday's hearing will cover four concurrent sentences for use of a deadly weapon and two consecutive sentences for assault with a deadly weapon, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Four board members will vote after the hearing and Simpson could be free by Oct. 1 if they are all in favor of parole. If Simpson is indeed released this fall—which appears almost certainly to be the decision—it will \"renew the rabid curiosity\" in the case and \"produce a spectacle unlike anything we’ve seen since he went behind bars,\" Nancy Armour at USA Today predicts. There has even been talk that Simpson might end up with a reality TV show, but Armour wants Simpson to avoid the spotlight unless he wants to return to the \"toxic mentality that landed him in prison in the first place.\" If the former NFL star does end up with a TV show, the money is likely to go to the families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, CBS News reports.

{"pred": "Jamaica has passed a law decriminalizing small amounts of marijuana, also known as ganja, and establishing a licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of the drug for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The law makes possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana a petty offense, punishable by a fine rather than arrest and criminal charges. The law also allows for the cultivation of small quantities of marijuana for personal use and permits the use of marijuana for religious purposes, specifically for Rastafarian adherents.\n\nThe law is a significant step towards the development of Jamaica's medical marijuana industry, which is expected to create jobs and generate revenue for the country. The industry is also expected to create new opportunities for Jamaican entrepreneurs and innovators to develop products such as marijuana-derived medicines and cosmetics.\n\nThe law does not apply to the cultivation, transportation, or distribution of marijuana for illegal purposes, and the Jamaican government has emphasized that it will continue to uphold its international obligations to combat drug trafficking and organized crime.\n\nThe decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana is part of a growing trend in the Americas, with several countries and states having already taken similar steps. The move is seen as a step towards reducing the stigma associated with marijuana use and promoting a more nuanced approach to drug policy.\n\nThe law is also seen as a significant step forward for Jamaica's Rastafarian community, which has long advocated for the right to use marijuana as part of their religious practices. The law is expected to have a positive impact on the community and promote greater understanding and acceptance of Rastafarian beliefs and practices.\n\nOverall, the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana is a significant step forward for Jamaica and is expected to have a positive impact on the country's economy, society, and culture.", "answers": ["Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself. Jamaica's parliament last night approved a law decriminalizing small amounts of pot, the AP reports. People found with 2 ounces or less of marijuana will now simply receive a ticket—not a crime on their record—and cultivation of five plants or fewer is now allowed. A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement. Jamaica also hopes to boost its health tourism and medical marijuana industries and make it a major player in the pot product market, the Guardian notes.

The search efforts have been ongoing for nearly a week, with ships and planes scouring the sea and coastline. The discovery of the wreckage was made on Saturday, with the head of the National Search and Rescue Agency, Henry Bambang Soelistyo, confirming that the objects found were part of the plane.\n\nThe crash occurred on a route that AirAsia was not authorized to fly on, as the airline only had permission to operate on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The airline has been accused of violating its operating license, and the Transport Ministry has launched an investigation into the matter.\n\nThe cause of the crash remains unclear, but weather conditions are believed to have played a role. The weather was bad, with strong winds and thunderstorms in the area, and the plane was flying in an area with intense weather activity. The weather was so bad that the pilot had to ask for permission to fly higher, but was denied.\n\nThe crash has been met with widespread grief, with many families of the victims still waiting for news of their loved ones. The Indonesian government has launched a full-scale investigation into the crash, and the Transport Ministry has suspended AirAsia's permission to fly on the Surabaya-Singapore route.\n\nThe search for survivors has been ongoing, with rescue teams scouring the sea and coastline for bodies and debris. The bodies of 12 people have been found so far, and many more are expected to be recovered in the coming days.

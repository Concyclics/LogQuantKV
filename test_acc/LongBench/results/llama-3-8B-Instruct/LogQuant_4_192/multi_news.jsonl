{"pred": "Recent research has revealed a shocking connection between cigarette smoke and the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A study published in the journal Infection and Immunity found that cigarette smoke exposure makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive, allowing it to evade the immune system and cause more severe infections.\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that cigarette smoke exposure alters the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are used by the immune system to kill pathogens. This increased resistance allows MRSA to survive and thrive, making it more difficult to treat and potentially leading to more severe infections.\n\nThe study also found that cigarette smoke exposure makes MRSA more resistant to macrophages, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting infections. In fact, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that cigarette smoke exposure also makes MRSA more aggressive, allowing it to adhere better to human cells and invade them more easily. This increased virulence could lead to more severe infections and a higher risk of mortality.\n\nThe researchers hope that their findings will add to the growing body of evidence highlighting the dangers of cigarette smoking and the importance of quitting. According to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, \"Cigarette smokers are known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Now we have evidence that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor.\"\n\nThe study's findings are particularly concerning given the growing prevalence of MRSA infections, which can cause life-threatening infections in the skin, bloodstream, or surgical sites. The researchers hope that their findings will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between cigarette smoke and MRSA, and ultimately, to the development of new treatments and prevention strategies for MRSA infections.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The organization has made significant progress in reducing the number of children in institutions, with a 70% reduction in Moldova, 75% in the Czech Republic, and 54% in Bulgaria.\n\nThe problem of institutionalization is widespread, with 8 million children worldwide separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. Many of these children are not orphans, but are instead placed in institutions because their families cannot provide for them. The effects of institutionalization are severe, including malnutrition, developmental delays, and psychological trauma.\n\nLumos is working to address this issue by providing support to vulnerable families, promoting inclusive education and health, and advocating for family-based care alternatives. The organization is also working with international donors to prioritize funding for these efforts.\n\nThe solution to ending institutionalization is not just a moral imperative, but also makes economic sense. It is more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution, and reduces long-term costs by preventing dependency in adulthood.\n\nThe #Letstalklumos campaign, launched by Rowling, aims to raise awareness and create a global movement to end institutionalization.

The rectangular building, which was once a gathering place for feasts, has produced finds including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch. The site, which is part of the enormous Marden Henge, is thought to have been used for status and power displays, showcasing the wealth and ability to mobilize a massive workforce.\n\nIn a separate discovery, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to be that of a child, has been unearthed at Wilsford henge. The body was found lying in a foetal position, wearing an amber necklace, and will undergo scientific analysis to provide information on the child's gender, diet, and date of burial. The three-year dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, and other organizations, aims to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.\n\nThe discoveries at Marden Henge and Wilsford henge are part of a larger excavation project in the Vale of Pewsey, which has already produced a range of finds, including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and copper bracelets.

The feathers on its head and chest are similar to those found in modern hummingbirds, and are thought to have been used for display purposes, such as attracting a mate or intimidating rivals.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and their use in dinosaurs. The fossilized remains of the dinosaur show that it had a bird-like body, including the sorts of feathers required for flight, but it also had a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor.\n\nThe team of scientists who discovered Caihong juji used a combination of fossil analysis and computer simulations to reconstruct the dinosaur's appearance and behavior. They found that the dinosaur's feathers were not only iridescent, but also had a unique structure that would have allowed them to reflect light and create a shimmering effect.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji is significant because it provides evidence that iridescent feathers were present in dinosaurs much earlier than previously thought. It also suggests that the evolution of feathers was a more complex process than previously believed, and that different species of dinosaurs may have developed different types of feathers for different purposes.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji is a significant find for paleontologists and scientists who study the evolution of life on Earth.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The tax adds 1.75 cents per ounce to sugary drinks, with the goal of reducing sugar consumption and raising revenue for the city. However, many argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and driving business out of the city.\n\nThe tax has led to significant price increases, with a case of Gatorade now costing over 64% more than it did before the tax. Retailers like Costco have responded by posting signs directing customers to locations outside the city limits where they can buy the same products without the tax. This has led to a decline in sales and a loss of revenue for the city.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, as it does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages. Starbucks, for example, has rejected the tax, citing its inconsistent application.\n\nThe tax has also been met with resistance from the beverage industry, with companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo spending millions to fight the tax. In Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed just two months after its implementation due to public outcry and a decline in sales.\n\nA bill has been reintroduced in Washington state to impose a similar tax statewide, but it is unlikely to pass this year.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline stance, refusing to negotiate with House Republicans and urging President Barack Obama to veto any bill that includes changes to the ACA.\n\nThe shutdown would have significant consequences for the Washington D.C. region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors. According to estimates, the region could lose $200 million a day and over 700,000 jobs could be affected. The shutdown would also impact local businesses, with many federal contractors and employees staying home and not spending money in the local economy.\n\nThe shutdown would also have widespread ripple effects, including delays in the processing of federal benefits, the closure of national parks and monuments, and disruptions to the judicial system. Local governments are preparing for the worst, setting aside funds to mitigate the impact of a shutdown.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner is under pressure from his own party to stand firm on the ACA, while Senate Democrats are confident that they can withstand the pressure and maintain their stance.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission is named after astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. The spacecraft will be launched in July 2018 and will take seven years to complete its journey, during which it will make 24 close flybys of the sun.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from temperatures of up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, while keeping its science instruments at room temperature. The spacecraft will also have a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to keep it safe.\n\nThe mission's objectives include tracing the energy behind solar wind, understanding the heating of the solar corona, and determining what accelerates the solar wind. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will fly within 9 solar radii of the sun's surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun before. The mission will also carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate with an inscription of his choice.\n\nThe spacecraft will be launched from Kennedy Space Center and will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion, or closest point to the sun. It will repeat this flyby of the perihelion routine 23 more times over its lifetime until 2025.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is a historic mission that will revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its impact on the solar system.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The discovery was made by a team of researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Dr. Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in reclassifying Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\nThe team used mathematical and computer modeling to identify the planet's existence, and believe it will be detected via telescope within the next five years. The discovery has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet, with some arguing that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Dr. Brown and his team argue that the solar system is better understood with eight dominant objects, and that Pluto's reclassification was necessary to avoid having to consider hundreds of other small worlds as planets.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked excitement about the possibility of discovering new types of objects in the outer reaches of the solar system. The New Horizons spacecraft, which flew by Pluto in 2015, has renewed interest in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies and other small celestial objects beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\nDr. Brown, who has received hate mail and criticism for his role in reclassifying Pluto, believes that the controversy will eventually die down and that the discovery of Planet Nine will be a major breakthrough in our understanding of the solar system. He argues that the discovery of new objects in the Kuiper Belt is more exciting than the discovery of a new planet, and that the controversy over Pluto's status is a relic of the past.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine is a significant development in the field of astronomy, and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the solar system and the search for new celestial bodies.", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

The Warratyi rock-shelter, located about 550 kilometers north of Adelaide, contains a treasure trove of artefacts, including burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, and red ochre and gypsum pigments. The site is significant not only because of its age but also because it shows that humans were able to develop local technologies, such as fine stone tools and bone technology, independently of outside influences.\n\nThe discovery challenges the traditional view that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world. The site also provides evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and a large, extinct flightless bird. The bones and eggs of these animals were found in the same layer as the artefacts, suggesting that early humans were living alongside and hunting these animals.\n\nThe discovery has been dated using a combination of methods, including quartz grain dating and radiocarbon dating of burnt eggshells. The quartz grains have been dated to around 44,000 years ago, while the burnt eggshells have been dated to between 45,000 and 49,000 years ago. The team believes that the site is likely to be even older, with some estimates suggesting it could be as old as 50,000 years.\n\nThe discovery is significant not only for its age but also for its implications for our understanding of human migration and settlement in Australia. It suggests that humans were able to expand out of the coastal regions and into the arid interior of the country much earlier than previously thought, and that they were able to develop local technologies and adapt to the harsh environment.\n\nThe discovery has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of archaeology and has been published in the journal Nature.

This would be done by using a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" to hover around a star and beam energy back to a nearby planet.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960 and has since been featured in science fiction works such as Olaf Stapledon's novel \"Star Maker\" and Larry Niven's novel \"Ringworld.\" Dyson spheres would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, known as \"statites,\" which would hover in space and form a cloud around the star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe paper also suggests that advanced civilizations would be able to detect the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away from them, and that humans may not have the technology yet to detect these signatures. However, it is hoped that astronomers will develop the necessary instruments to detect these signatures before our sun becomes another flaming marble in some distant civilization's collection.\n\nOverall, the paper provides a new perspective on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and the possibility of advanced civilizations harvesting energy from distant stars.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

This segment marked a turning point for the show, as it showed that The Daily Show could not only be funny but also insightful and relevant.\n\nThe show's success was fueled by its ability to poke fun at the conventions of traditional news reporting and to expose the behind-the-scenes machinations of politics. The show's correspondents became known for their ability to ask tough questions and to challenge politicians to think critically about their actions.\n\nThroughout its run, The Daily Show became a cultural phenomenon, attracting a large and dedicated audience and earning numerous awards and accolades. The show's impact on the media landscape was significant, as it helped to redefine the role of comedy in journalism and to create a new kind of news programming that was both entertaining and informative.", "answers": ["Jon Stewart took over as host of the Daily Show in January 1999, but when did the program truly start becoming the Daily Show that legions of fans would come to love?

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved.

Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment.

{"pred": "Scientists have made groundbreaking discoveries in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin, uncovering evidence of ancient human innovation and technological advancements dating back 320,000 years. The findings, published in three new studies, suggest that early humans in Africa were more advanced than previously thought, with a sophisticated understanding of technology, social networks, and symbolic expression.\n\nThe research reveals that the earliest Middle Stone Age tools, characterized by smaller, more specialized stone tools and the use of obsidian, emerged tens of thousands of years earlier than previously believed. The tools were made from raw materials sourced from distant locations, indicating a complex network of trade and exchange between different groups of people.\n\nThe discoveries also include evidence of the earliest known use of pigments, with red and black rocks being drilled and ground to extract color. This suggests that early humans used pigments symbolically, possibly for personal adornment or to convey social status.\n\nThe findings challenge the long-held view that modern human behavior, including symbolism, innovation, and art, emerged suddenly around 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that these behaviors developed gradually over time, with early humans adapting to changing environmental conditions and developing new technologies to cope with uncertainty.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of climate change in driving human innovation and technological advancement. The Olorgesailie Basin, which was once a floodplain, underwent significant environmental changes around 300,000 years ago, leading to the development of a vast arid grassland. This would have made life difficult for early humans, who needed to adapt or go extinct.\n\nThe discoveries in Olorgesailie Basin provide a glimpse into the lives of early humans in Africa, revealing a complex and dynamic society that was capable of innovation, cooperation, and symbolic expression. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Kieran was born with bilateral microtia, a rare condition where the external ear is underdeveloped, and was also deaf. However, thanks to previous operations and a hearing aid, he has been able to hear. The surgery, led by consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The ears were then grafted onto his head under pockets of skin and shaped to match the contours of his head.\n\nThe procedure was primarily cosmetic, but it brings significant psychological benefits, improving Kieran's confidence and self-esteem. Kieran's parents, David and Louise, were overjoyed with the result, saying it was a \"game-changer\" for their son. Kieran's new ears will need a follow-up operation in six months to make them stand out from his scalp more, but he is already delighted with the result.\n\nThe procedure is a major breakthrough in reconstructive surgery, and researchers are working on developing new techniques using stem cells to create ear frameworks and other skeletal structures.

The panda had been chased by local officials trying to capture it, and Guan's son sued the forestry officials and the nearby Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, which is home to over 100 wild pandas. After negotiations, the officials agreed to pay the compensation, which will cover Guan's medical bills and may also cover future operations.\n\nThe incident highlights the dangers of wild pandas, which are often thought to be harmless due to their gentle appearance.

{"pred": "NASA scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the history of Mars, revealing that a massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the planet's northern hemisphere. The ocean, which was at least a mile deep in some areas, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding challenges previous theories that Mars was a dry and barren planet, and instead suggests that it was once a warm and wet world with a habitable environment.\n\nThe discovery was made by analyzing the isotopic composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which revealed that the planet's water has been depleted over time. The team used powerful telescopes to study the atmosphere and found that the concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, is much higher on Mars than on Earth. This suggests that Mars lost a significant amount of water to space, which would have formed an ocean that covered a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe scientists estimate that the ocean would have been at least 137 meters deep, and possibly much deeper, and would have been a major factor in shaping the planet's geology and climate. The finding also raises the possibility that life could have existed on Mars in the past, as the ocean would have provided a habitable environment.\n\nThe discovery is based on data collected by NASA's Curiosity rover, which has been exploring Mars since 2012. The rover has found evidence of ancient lakes, rivers, and deltas on the planet, and has detected methane in the atmosphere, which could be a sign of microbial life. The European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which is set to launch in 2018, will search for signs of life on Mars by analyzing the chemical composition of the soil and rocks.\n\nThe finding has significant implications for our understanding of the history of Mars and the possibility of life on the planet. It suggests that Mars was once a much more Earth-like planet, with a thick atmosphere and liquid water, and raises the possibility that life could have evolved on the planet. The discovery also highlights the importance of continued exploration of Mars and the search for signs of life beyond our planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one. (Just to keep things in perspective, we'll point out that Look is the sort of magazine that also runs headlines like, \"Royal Bodyguard Warns: 'Kate Middleton's Baby Is In Danger!'\") In other news, Huffington Post notes that it's Cruise's 51st birthday."], "all_classes": null, "length": 790}

The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later.

{"pred": "Egypt is holding its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its gains and potentially win a majority of seats. The Brotherhood has already won a plurality of seats in the first two rounds, and its leader, Essam el-Erian, has said that the party may not win more than half the seats. The Brotherhood has also downplayed its electoral strength, saying it will form a coalition government to avoid unnerving Egyptian liberals and Westerners.\n\nMeanwhile, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak has resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing Mubarak of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensure his son, Gamal, would succeed him. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the uprising that forced him out of office. His two sons, Alaa and Gamal, face corruption charges, and Mubarak could face the death penalty if convicted.\n\nThe election and Mubarak's trial come amid growing opposition to the ruling generals, who say they will not cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June. The new parliament is expected to be formed on January 23, but its powers and composition are still unclear. The Brotherhood has said it will work with other parties to form a government, but the ultraconservative Salafis, who have won a significant number of seats, may also play a role.\n\nThe economy is also a major concern, with growth slowing due to unrest and a decline in foreign-currency reserves. The benchmark EGX 30 stock index has lost 49 percent in the past year, making it the third-worst performer among world markets.\n\nThe protests that ousted Mubarak are also being commemorated, with demonstrations planned for January 25, the anniversary of the uprising. The anniversary comes as the country is still grappling with the aftermath of the revolution, including the trial of Mubarak and the formation of a new government.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "Here is a one-page summary of the news:\n\nA bizarre incident occurred in Mendon on Wednesday evening when a car was suspended from a telephone guy wire after the driver reacted too quickly to a GPS unit's instructions. Nabila Altahan, the driver of a Toyota Corolla, was heading westbound on Route 4 when her GPS device suddenly instructed her to turn around, as she had passed her intended destination. In a swift reaction, Altahan left the road and the car ended up suspended on the guy wire of a telephone pole across from Sugar & Spice Restaurant. Fortunately, Altahan and her passenger were not injured in the incident. The car was suspended from the pole for a short time before being safely removed. The incident was witnessed by a bystander at the nearby miniature golf course, who saw the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended. State police and the Rutland City Fire Department responded to the scene, which was captured by a passing driver, Ray Ault. The incident serves as a reminder to always exercise caution when following GPS directions and to avoid reacting impulsively to sudden changes in navigation.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP.

Macrophages, immune cells that devour infectious agents, were found to have a harder time killing MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke.

They found that the bloodstains on the cloth are not consistent with the idea that the cloth was used to wrap the body of a crucified person, but rather suggest that the cloth was used to wrap a standing model.\n\nThe researchers tested the bloodstains on the cloth by pumping blood onto a model at wound points depicted on the shroud and comparing the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction seen on the linen.

The sanctions include a ban on international flights, a freeze on the country's bank account, and the closure of borders. The Economic Community of West African States has given the junta a 72-hour deadline to restore civilian rule, which expired on Monday.\n\nThe sanctions are already having a significant impact on the country, with long lines forming at gas stations as the country's fuel supplies dwindle.

The charity has made significant progress in reducing the number of children in institutions, with a 70% reduction in Moldova, 75% in the Czech Republic, and 54% in Bulgaria.\n\nThe problem of institutionalization is widespread, with 8 million children worldwide separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. Many of these children are not orphans, but are instead placed in institutions because their families cannot afford to care for them or lack access to education and healthcare. The effects of institutionalization are severe, including malnutrition, abuse, and long-term psychological trauma.\n\nLumos is working to address this issue by providing support to vulnerable families, promoting inclusive education and healthcare, and advocating for family-based care alternatives. The organization is also calling on international donors to prioritize funding for these efforts, as it is more cost-effective to support children in families than in institutions.\n\nThe charity is optimistic that the practice of institutionalization can be eradicated by 2050, and is working with governments, NGOs, and individuals to make this goal a reality.

At Marden Henge, a 4,300-year-old house has been uncovered, believed to be one of the best-preserved from the period found in the UK. The rectangular building, which was once a gathering place for feasts, has produced finds including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch. The site, which is part of the enormous Marden Henge, is thought to have been used for status and power displays, showcasing the wealth and ability to mobilize a massive workforce.\n\nIn a separate discovery, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to be that of a child, has been unearthed at Wilsford henge. The body was found lying in a foetal position, wearing an amber necklace, and will undergo scientific analysis to provide information on the child's gender, diet, and date of burial. The three-year Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, and others, aims to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.\n\nThe discoveries at Marden Henge and Wilsford henge are significant, as they provide new insights into the lives of people who lived in the region during the Neolithic period.

The tax adds 1.75 cents per ounce to sugary drinks, with the goal of reducing sugar consumption and raising revenue for the city. However, many argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and driving business out of the city.\n\nCostco, a major retailer, has seen a significant decline in sales of sugary drinks since the tax was implemented, with a case of Gatorade increasing in price by over 64%. The company has posted signs directing customers to its stores outside the city limits, where they can avoid the tax. Other retailers have also reported a decline in sales, with some saying they will have to raise prices or reduce staff.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, as it does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages. Starbucks, which is headquartered in Seattle, has rejected the tax.\n\nThe city's policymakers have been accused of ignoring the lessons of other cities that have implemented similar taxes, such as Cook County, Illinois, which repealed its sweetened beverage tax after just two months due to public outcry. Seattle's tax has also been criticized for its administrative gaffes, including a decision to apply the tax to purchases made with federal food stamp benefits, which was later reversed.\n\nThe tax has also sparked a debate over its effectiveness in reducing sugar consumption and improving public health. While some argue that the tax is a necessary step to address the growing obesity epidemic, others argue that it is an ineffective and regressive measure that will only harm low-income families and small businesses.\n\nIn related news, a bill has been introduced in the Washington state legislature to impose a similar tax on sugary drinks statewide. The bill has been met with opposition from some business owners, who argue that it will drive customers out of the state and harm local businesses.\n\nOverall, the Seattle sweetened beverage tax has been a controversial and divisive issue, with proponents and opponents weighing in on its effectiveness and fairness.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

The House of Representatives has passed a bill that delays the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and repeals the medical device tax, but Senate Democrats are refusing to accept these changes. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline stance, refusing to negotiate with House Republicans and urging President Barack Obama to veto any bill that includes changes to the ACA.\n\nThe shutdown would have significant consequences for the Washington D.C. region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors. According to estimates, the region could lose $200 million a day and over 700,000 jobs could be affected. The shutdown would also impact federal services, including the processing of benefits, housing and small business loans, and clinical trials.\n\nLocal governments are preparing for the worst, setting aside funds to mitigate the impact of a shutdown. Maryland and Virginia officials are looking at tapping reserve funds to make up for lost revenue. The shutdown could also have a ripple effect on state and local governments, impacting services such as Meals on Wheels and emergency preparedness training.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner is under pressure from his own party to take a harder stance on the ACA, while Senate Democrats are confident that they can withstand the pressure and maintain their opposition to the bill. The clock is ticking, with the deadline to pass a spending bill looming on Monday night. If a deal is not reached, a partial government shutdown could occur, with significant consequences for the US economy and the Washington D.C. region.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission is named after astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. The spacecraft will be launched in July 2018 and will take seven years to complete its journey, making 24 close flybys of the sun.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, while keeping the science instruments at room temperature. The spacecraft will also have a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to keep it safe.\n\nThe mission's objectives include tracing the energy behind solar wind, understanding the heating of the solar corona, and determining what accelerates the solar wind. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will fly within 9 solar radii of the sun's surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun before. The mission will also carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate carrying his message to the sun.\n\nThe spacecraft will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion, and will repeat that flyby of the perihelion routine 23 more times over its lifetime until 2025. The 20-day launch window opens on July 31, 2018, and the spacecraft will arrive at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to prep for launch.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is a historic mission that will revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its impact on the solar system.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

This would be done by using a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" to hover around a star and beam energy back to a nearby planet.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960 and has since been featured in science fiction works such as Olaf Stapledon's novel \"Star Maker\" and Larry Niven's novel \"Ringworld.\" Dyson spheres would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, known as \"statites,\" which would hover in space and form a cloud around a star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe paper also suggests that advanced civilizations would be able to detect the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away from them, and that humans may not have the technology yet to detect these signatures. However, it is hoped that astronomers will develop the necessary instruments to detect these signatures before our sun becomes another flaming marble in some distant civilization's collection.\n\nOverall, the paper provides a new perspective on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and the possibility of advanced civilizations harvesting energy from distant stars.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

{"pred": "Scientists have made groundbreaking discoveries in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin, uncovering evidence of ancient human innovation and technological advancements dating back 320,000 years. The findings, published in three new studies, suggest that early humans in Africa were more advanced than previously thought, with a sophisticated understanding of technology, social networks, and symbolic expression.\n\nThe research reveals that the earliest Middle Stone Age tools, characterized by smaller, more specialized stone tools and the use of obsidian, emerged tens of thousands of years earlier than previously believed. The tools were made from raw materials sourced from distant locations, indicating a complex network of trade and exchange between different groups of people.\n\nThe discoveries also include evidence of the earliest known use of pigments, with red ochre being ground and cut to create a vibrant color. This suggests that early humans had a sophisticated understanding of art and symbolism, using color to convey meaning and identity.\n\nThe findings challenge the traditional view of human evolution, which posits that modern human behavior and culture emerged suddenly around 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that complex behaviors and technological innovations were present in Africa much earlier, with the Middle Stone Age marking a significant turning point in human development.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of climate change and environmental factors in driving human innovation and adaptation. The Olorgesailie Basin, which was once a floodplain, underwent significant changes around 300,000 years ago, leading to the development of a vast arid grassland. This would have made life difficult for early humans, who were forced to adapt and innovate to survive.\n\nThe discoveries have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the emergence of modern human behavior. They suggest that the \"human revolution\" was not a sudden event, but rather a gradual process that occurred over thousands of years, with early humans developing complex behaviors and technologies in response to their environment.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

However, many have mocked this claim, arguing that it is a move driven by hubris, arrogance, and greed.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has been met with criticism, with some arguing that it is a step backward in terms of innovation and user experience. The article highlights the inconvenience of having to use a $9 aux-to-Lightning cable dongle to listen to music while charging the phone. Additionally, the article notes that the decision to remove the headphone jack will affect not only music listeners but also users of other devices that plug into the phone's headphone jack, such as credit card dongles, temperature sensors, and light meters.\n\nThe article also questions the logic behind Apple's decision, citing the lack of technological excuse for removing the headphone jack. The author argues that wired audio almost always sounds better than wireless audio and that the removal of the headphone jack is a step backward in terms of sound quality.\n\nFurthermore, the article criticizes Apple's decision to replace the headphone jack with a proprietary system, citing the inconvenience and cost of using AirPods, which are prone to loss and require an iCloud account to connect. The article concludes that Apple's decision is a move to build a walled garden, where users are forced to conform to Apple's proprietary standards, and that this move will ultimately be paid for by the consumer.", "answers": ["Apple presented its new smartphone Wednesday, and nestled in with the iPhone 7's much-ballyhooed features was the disclosure that the company is getting rid of the phone's headphone jack—news that wasn't exactly met with universal acclaim, or much acclaim at all. Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

Kieran was born with bilateral microtia, a rare condition where the external ear is underdeveloped, and was also deaf. However, thanks to previous operations and a hearing aid, he has been able to hear. The surgery, led by consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The ears were then grafted onto his head under pockets of skin and shaped to match the contours of his head.\n\nThe procedure was primarily cosmetic, but it brings significant psychological benefits, boosting Kieran's confidence and self-esteem. Kieran's parents, David and Louise, were overjoyed with the result, saying it was a \"game-changer\" for their son. The surgery is a major improvement in quality of life for children with microtia, and experts believe it can alter their whole trajectory in life.\n\nResearchers at the University College London Institute for Child Health are working on a new approach to ear reconstruction using stem cells from a child's own fat tissue, which could be less invasive than the current method. While this technology is still in its early stages, it holds promise for the future of ear reconstruction.

The raid was part of an investigation into the company's use of illegally obtained wood, specifically ebony from Madagascar.

The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims that the government has not provided clear evidence of wrongdoing and that the company's business has been severely impacted by the raid.\n\nThe Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, and the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood. However, Gibson denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with US and Malagasy law. The company has presented documents to support its claim and says it stopped importing wood from Madagascar in 2009.\n\nThe guitar industry is divided on the Lacey Act, with some, like Chris Martin of C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the law as a necessary measure to stop illegal logging. Others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature and the potential for guitar builders to be forced to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also had an impact on the trade in vintage instruments, with some dealers, like George Gruhn, warning that owners may be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the US. The EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the law, stating that it is intended to reduce illegal logging and promote responsible wood sourcing.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

{"pred": "NASA scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery about the history of Mars, revealing that the planet was once covered by a massive ocean that was at least a mile deep and covered nearly a fifth of its surface. The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was a significant factor in the planet's habitability and could have supported life. The discovery was made by analyzing the isotopic composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which showed that the planet had lost a vast amount of water over time.\n\nThe research suggests that the ocean was formed when water from the Martian polar caps and underground aquifers flowed onto the surface, creating a global ocean that was much deeper than previously thought. The ocean was likely to have been warm and wet, with temperatures similar to those on Earth, making it a prime candidate for supporting life.\n\nThe discovery is significant because it challenges previous theories about the history of Mars, which suggested that the planet was a cold and dry place with only occasional flooding. The new evidence suggests that Mars was once a warm and wet world, with a stable climate that could have supported life.\n\nThe research also provides new insights into the evolution of the Martian atmosphere, which is thought to have been much thicker and more hospitable to life than it is today.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Researchers analyzed the vocalizations of birds and found that many species make sounds with their beaks closed, known as closed-mouth vocalizations. This behavior is often used for mating and territorial displays, and is more common in larger bird species. The study suggests that this behavior may have evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups, and found that 52 out of 208 investigated bird species use this behavior. They also found that only animals with a relatively large body size, such as doves and ostriches, use closed-mouth vocalization.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur vocalizations. Since dinosaurs are members of the archosaur group and many had large body sizes, it is likely that some dinosaurs made closed-mouthed vocalizations, perhaps during mating displays.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

In that case, a team of statisticians from Metron Inc. used Bayesian methods to help locate the plane's wreckage, which was found two years later.\n\nThe process involves using historical data from previous crashes, as well as data from the current search, to create a probability map of where the plane might be located.

Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one.

{"pred": "Egypt is holding its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its gains and potentially win a majority of the seats. The Brotherhood has already won a plurality of seats in the first two rounds, and its candidates are strong in the nine provinces voting in the final round. The party's leader, Essam el-Erian, has said that while the Brotherhood may win more than half the seats, it does not plan to form an all-Islamist government and will instead seek to form a coalition with other parties.\n\nMeanwhile, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak has resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing Mubarak of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensuring his son Gamal would succeed him. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the uprising that forced him from office, and could face the death penalty if convicted. His two sons, Alaa and Gamal, are also on trial, facing corruption charges.\n\nThe elections and Mubarak's trial come amid growing opposition to the ruling military council, which has been criticized for its handling of the transition to democracy. Protesters are planning to take to the streets on January 25 to mark the anniversary of the uprising that ousted Mubarak, and there are concerns about the military's plans for the country's future.\n\nEconomic growth has slowed in Egypt, with foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% and the stock market losing 49% of its value last year. The country's new parliament is expected to face significant challenges in addressing the country's economic woes, and the Brotherhood's plans for the economy are still unclear.\n\nOverall, the situation in Egypt remains uncertain, with many questions about the country's political and economic future. The Brotherhood's potential dominance of the parliament could have significant implications for the country's direction, and the trial of Mubarak and his sons is a reminder of the country's tumultuous past.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes.

The team found that the dinosaur's feathers were not only iridescent, but also had a unique structure that was different from other dinosaurs.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The study, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011. The results showed that younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer and were more likely to undergo surgery and radiation therapy. Despite this, younger patients had a slightly better five-year survival rate than older patients.\n\nThe study suggests that the current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening may need to be revised to include younger patients. Dr. Hendren notes that the findings are a \"wake-up call\" for the medical community to start considering the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients.\n\nExperts agree that the exact cause of the increase in colorectal cancer among younger patients is unknown, but it may be related to lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, and poor diet.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR.

The Military Commissions Act of 2006 revoked the right to habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay, allowing the government to hold individuals without cause or legal recourse. This has led to indefinite detention and psychological deterioration for many prisoners.\n\nIn a related development, a New York judge has granted a writ of habeas corpus to two research chimps, Hercules and Leo, allowing them to challenge their detention at Stony Brook University.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The decision means that the Kit Kat bar's shape is no longer protected as a trademark in the EU, and could lead to other companies producing their own four-fingered chocolate bars.\n\nThe dispute began in 2002, when Nestle applied for a trademark on the shape of the Kit Kat bar. Mondelez, the owner of the Cadbury brand, opposed the application, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be protected as a trademark. The EU's trademark office granted the trademark in 2006, but Mondelez appealed the decision, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be protected.\n\nThe case has been ongoing for over a decade, with the EU's highest court, the European Court of Justice, finally ruling in favor of Mondelez.

This method is used by birds to produce low-frequency sounds, often for mating or territorial displays.\n\nThe study analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization, which is often associated with large body size.

The resulting videos were blurry and dream-like, but showed that the technology can accurately reconstruct dynamic visual experiences.\n\nThe researchers believe that this technology could be used to read people's dreams, memories, and even fantasies. They also hope to use it to understand how the brain processes visual information and to develop a way to decode brain activity into visual images.\n\nThe technology is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we understand the human brain.

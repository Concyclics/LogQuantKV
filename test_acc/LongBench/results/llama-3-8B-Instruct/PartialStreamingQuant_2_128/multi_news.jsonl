The trail, which spans 2,650 miles from California to Washington state, is a popular destination for hikers seeking a transformative experience. However, the influx of new hikers has raised concerns about overcrowding, environmental damage, and the potential for hikers to negatively impact the trail and surrounding communities.\n\nAccording to the Pacific Crest Trail Association, the number of hikers has increased from 300 in 2006 to over 4,000 in 2016. The trail's permit system, which allows for 50 hikers per day, is intended to spread out the hikers and reduce the impact on the trail and environment. However, some hikers are still arriving unprepared and unexperienced, which can lead to negative consequences for themselves and the trail.\n\nThe PCTA is promoting responsible hiking practices, including the \"leave no trace\" principle, to ensure that hikers respect the trail and the environment. The organization is also encouraging hikers to plan ahead, including obtaining necessary permits and preparing for the physical and mental demands of the hike.\n\nDespite the challenges, many hikers are inspired by the trail and the sense of community it fosters.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India.

The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

The ocean, which was at least 137 meters deep, was present on Mars around 4.5 billion years ago, when the planet was still in its early stages of formation. The discovery was made by analyzing the composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which showed a significant enrichment of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThe team of scientists, led by Geronimo Villanueva, used data from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope to study the atmospheric maps of Mars. They found that the water vapor on Mars is enriched with deuterium, indicating that the planet has lost a significant amount of water over time.\n\nThe discovery suggests that the ancient ocean on Mars was much larger than previously thought, covering nearly half of the planet's surface. The ocean would have been a significant factor in shaping the planet's geology and potentially creating a habitable environment for life.\n\nThe study also suggests that the planet's atmosphere was much thicker and more hospitable to life in the distant past, with temperatures and pressures that would have allowed liquid water to exist.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that some dinosaurs may have mumbled or cooed instead of roaring like the iconic Tyrannosaurus Rex from the movie \"Jurassic Park\". The study, published in the journal Evolution, found that some dinosaurs may have used a unique vocalization method called \"closed-mouth vocalization\", where they emitted sounds through a cavity in their throat while keeping their beaks closed. This type of vocalization is still used by some birds today, such as ostriches and cassowaries, to make low-pitched sounds. The study suggests that this type of vocalization may have evolved in dinosaurs as well, particularly in larger species. The researchers analyzed the vocalizations of over 200 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization, which is likely to have evolved independently in different lineages. The study suggests that dinosaurs may have used this type of vocalization to communicate, particularly for mating or territorial displays. The researchers also found that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization is more common in larger body sizes, which may have been a factor in the evolution of this behavior. The study's findings provide new insights into the sounds made by dinosaurs and how they may have communicated with each other.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

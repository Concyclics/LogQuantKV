{"pred": "Recent research has revealed a shocking connection between cigarette smoke and the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A study published in the journal Infection and Immunity found that cigarette smoke exposure makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive, allowing it to evade the immune system and cause more severe infections.\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that cigarette smoke exposure alters the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are used by the immune system to kill pathogens. This increased resistance allows MRSA to survive and thrive, making it more difficult to treat and potentially leading to more severe infections.\n\nThe study also found that cigarette smoke exposure makes MRSA more resistant to macrophages, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting infections. In fact, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that cigarette smoke exposure also makes MRSA more aggressive, allowing it to adhere better to human cells and invade them more easily. This increased virulence could lead to more severe infections and a higher risk of mortality.\n\nThe researchers hope that their findings will add to the growing body of evidence highlighting the dangers of cigarette smoking and the importance of quitting. According to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, \"Cigarette smokers are known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. Now we have evidence that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor.\"\n\nThe study's findings are particularly concerning given the growing prevalence of MRSA infections, which can cause life-threatening infections of the skin, bloodstream, or surgical sites.

The exact cause is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Symptoms include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech.\n\nThe CDC is urging parents to take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, including washing hands frequently, staying up-to-date on vaccinations, and protecting against mosquitoes. There is no specific treatment for AFM, but physical therapy and rehabilitation can help improve symptoms.\n\nThe condition has been reported in children as young as 2 years old, with the average age of those affected being 7 years old. Most patients have required hospitalization, and some have required ventilator support. While some patients have made significant progress, others have not shown improvement.\n\nThe CDC is working with state and local health departments to investigate the outbreak and identify the cause.

The investigation, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found that they are inconsistent with the idea that the cloth was used to wrap the body of a crucified person.\n\nThe researchers, led by Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to study the bloodstains on the cloth. They found that the bloodstains on the cloth are not consistent with the idea that the cloth was used to wrap the body of a crucified person, but rather suggest that the cloth was used to wrap a standing model.\n\nThe researchers tested the bloodstains on the cloth by pumping blood onto a model at wound points depicted on the shroud and comparing the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction seen on the linen.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

The tax adds 1.75 cents per ounce to sugary drinks, with the goal of reducing sugar consumption and raising revenue for the city. However, many argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and driving business out of the city.\n\nThe tax has led to significant price increases, with a case of Gatorade now costing over 64% more than it did before the tax. Retailers like Costco have responded by posting signs directing customers to locations outside the city limits where they can buy the same products without the tax. This has led to a decline in sales and a loss of revenue for the city.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, as it does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages. Starbucks, for example, has rejected the tax, citing its inconsistent application.\n\nThe tax has also been met with opposition from the beverage industry, with companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo spending millions to fight the tax.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The study found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar disorders. The researchers analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers, and found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy had a higher risk of having a child with ADHD.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development. However, the study did not find a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD, and the authors emphasized that the results do not mean that pregnant women should never take acetaminophen.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline stance, refusing to negotiate with House Republicans and urging President Barack Obama to veto any bill that includes changes to the ACA.\n\nThe shutdown would have significant consequences for the Washington D.C. region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission is named after astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. The spacecraft will be launched in July 2018 and will take seven years to complete its mission, during which it will make 24 close flybys of the sun.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from temperatures of up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, while keeping its science instruments at room temperature. The spacecraft will also have a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to keep it safe.\n\nThe mission's objectives include tracing the energy behind solar wind, understanding the heating of the solar corona, and determining what accelerates the solar wind. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will fly within 9 solar radii of the sun's surface, seven times closer than any other spacecraft has been to the sun before. The mission will also carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate with an inscription of his choice.\n\nThe spacecraft will be launched on a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center and will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion, or closest point to the sun.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

This would be done by using a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" to hover around a star and beam energy back to a nearby planet.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960 and has since been featured in science fiction works such as Olaf Stapledon's novel \"Star Maker\" and Larry Niven's novel \"Ringworld.\" Dyson spheres would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, known as \"statites,\" which would hover in space and form a cloud around the star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe paper also suggests that advanced civilizations would be able to detect the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away from them, and that humans may not have the technology yet to detect these signatures. However, it is hoped that astronomers will develop the necessary instruments to detect these signatures before our sun becomes another flaming marble in some distant civilization's collection.\n\nOverall, the paper provides a new perspective on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and the possibility of advanced civilizations harvesting energy from distant stars.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

{"pred": "Scientists have made groundbreaking discoveries in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin, uncovering evidence of ancient human innovation and technological advancements dating back 320,000 years. The findings, published in three new studies, suggest that early humans in Africa were more advanced than previously thought, with a sophisticated understanding of technology, social networks, and symbolic expression.\n\nThe research reveals that the earliest Middle Stone Age tools, characterized by smaller, more specialized stone tools and the use of obsidian, emerged tens of thousands of years earlier than previously believed. The tools were made from raw materials sourced from distant locations, indicating a complex network of trade and exchange between different groups of people.\n\nThe discoveries also include evidence of the earliest known use of pigments, with red ochre being ground and cut to create a vibrant color. This suggests that early humans had a sophisticated understanding of art and symbolism, using color to convey meaning and identity.\n\nThe findings challenge the traditional view of human evolution, which posits that modern human behavior and culture emerged suddenly around 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that complex behaviors and technological innovations were present in Africa much earlier, with the Middle Stone Age marking a significant turning point in human development.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of climate change and environmental factors in driving human innovation and adaptation. The Olorgesailie Basin, which was once a floodplain, underwent significant changes around 300,000 years ago, leading to the development of a vast arid grassland. This would have made life difficult for early humans, who were forced to adapt and innovate in order to survive.\n\nThe discoveries have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the emergence of modern human behavior. They suggest that the \"human revolution\" was not a sudden event, but rather a gradual process that occurred over thousands of years, with early humans developing complex technologies and social networks in response to environmental pressures.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Kieran was born with bilateral microtia, a rare condition where the external ear is underdeveloped, and was also deaf. However, thanks to previous operations and a hearing aid, he has been able to hear. The surgery, led by consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The ears were then grafted onto his head under pockets of skin and shaped to match the contours of his head.\n\nThe procedure was primarily cosmetic, but it brings significant psychological benefits, boosting Kieran's confidence and self-esteem. Kieran's parents, David and Louise, were overjoyed with the result, saying it was a \"game-changer\" for their son. The surgery is not a new procedure, but it is still a major operation that requires careful planning and execution.\n\nResearchers at the University College London Institute for Child Health are working on developing a new technique that uses stem cells from a child's own fat to create a new ear. This approach would be less invasive than the current method and could potentially revolutionize the treatment of children born without ears. While this technology is still in its early stages, it holds promise for the future of ear reconstruction.\n\nKieran's story highlights the importance of self-acceptance and the impact that a simple procedure can have on a child's life.

The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

The raid is believed to be related to the company's alleged trafficking in illegally obtained wood, specifically ebony from Madagascar. The Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants, and the government is preparing to charge Gibson with violating this law.\n\nGibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims that the company has been unfairly targeted and that the government has not provided sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. He also argues that the company has been injured by the raid, with millions of dollars in lost business.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has investigated Gibson's practices and concluded that the company knowingly imported tainted wood. The EIA's director, Andrea Johnson, stated that Gibson understood the risks involved and made a decision to source wood despite knowing that there was a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood.\n\nGibson has denied these allegations, claiming that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with US and Malagasy law. The company has presented documents to support this claim and asserts that the seized wood was legally obtained from India.\n\nThe Lacey Act has been criticized by some in the guitar industry, who argue that it is burdensome and retroactive. Attorney Ronald Bienstock warns that the law may require guitar builders to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago, which could be difficult or impossible.\n\nThe law has also raised concerns about the trade in vintage instruments, with some dealers warning that they may be forced to account for every wooden part of their instruments when re-entering the US. The government has attempted to create exemptions for vintage instruments, but these have been delayed and are not yet in place.\n\nOverall, the Gibson raid highlights the complexities and challenges of enforcing environmental regulations in the music industry. While some argue that the Lacey Act is necessary to combat illegal logging, others see it as a burden that may have unintended consequences.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India.

The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

The ocean, which was at least a mile deep in some areas, was a significant portion of the planet's surface, equivalent to the Atlantic Ocean covering the Earth. This finding is based on measurements of the Martian atmosphere and the concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, in the water vapor.\n\nThe research suggests that the ocean was present on Mars around 4.5 billion years ago, during a time when the planet was still in its early stages of formation. The ocean would have been a major factor in shaping the planet's geology and climate, and would have provided a habitable environment for life to emerge.\n\nThe discovery is based on data collected by NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, which were used to map the Martian atmosphere and measure the concentration of deuterium in the water vapor. The data shows that the concentration of deuterium in the Martian water vapor is much higher than on Earth, indicating that the planet has lost a significant amount of water over time.\n\nThe researchers estimate that the ocean would have covered an area of around 20% of the planet's surface, which is equivalent to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The research, published in the journal Evolution, found that many birds make sounds with their closed mouths, which are often quieter and lower in pitch than sounds made with an open beak. The study's authors analyzed the distribution of this vocal ability among birds and other reptilian groups and found that it has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs, and may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays. They also found that the ability to make closed-mouth vocalizations is associated with large body size, which may be due to the physical challenges of inflating an elastic cavity.\n\nThe study's findings offer a new perspective on what dinosaurs may have sounded like, and suggest that they may have made sounds similar to those of birds, such as cooing or booming. The researchers hope to use their findings to better understand the sounds made by extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors.\n\nIn related news, the sound designer for the movie Jurassic Park, Gary Rydstrom, has revealed that he used a variety of animal sounds to create the noises for the dinosaurs in the film, including a tortoise, a goose, and a baby owl.

Police, who have described the deaths as \"suspicious,\" revealed Sunday that the cause of death for both Shermans was \"ligature neck compression,\" a form of strangulation, the CBC reports. Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later. The couple also sent out invitations last week to a dinner party at their winter home in Palm Beach."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2360}
{"pred": "Egypt is holding its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its gains and potentially win a majority of seats. The party has already won a significant number of seats in the first two rounds of voting, and is expected to do well in the nine provinces voting in the final round. The Brotherhood has played down its electoral strength, but some analysts believe it could win more than 50% of the seats.\n\nMeanwhile, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak has resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing Mubarak of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensuring his son Gamal would succeed him. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the uprising that forced him from office, and could face the death penalty if convicted. His two sons, Alaa and Gamal, are also on trial, facing corruption charges.\n\nThe elections and Mubarak's trial come amid growing opposition to the ruling military council, which has been criticized for its handling of the transition to democracy. The council has said it will not cede power until presidential elections are held by the end of June, but protesters are demanding an earlier transfer of power.\n\nThe economy is also a major concern, with growth slowing due to the unrest and foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% in the first 11 months of 2011. The benchmark EGX 30 stock index lost 49% last year, making it the third-worst performer among world markets.\n\nThe new parliament is expected to hold its first session on January 23, but it is unclear what powers it will have and how a new government will be formed. The Brotherhood has said it intends to form a coalition or unity government, but winning a clear majority would enable it to govern without a coalition. The ultraconservative Salafis, who have won a significant number of seats, are also expected to play a key role in the new parliament.\n\nOverall, the situation in Egypt remains uncertain, with many questions surrounding the transition to democracy and the role of the military and Islamist groups in the new government.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

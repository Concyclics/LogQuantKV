Crotty Alexander of the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that cigarette smoke exposure caused MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species. This means that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was able to evade the immune system's defenses and cause more severe infections.\n\nThe researchers also discovered that the smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, making it more difficult to kill. Additionally, the study found that the bacteria was able to adhere better to human cells, allowing it to invade and cause more harm.\n\nThe study suggests that cigarette smoke may be an additional contributing factor to the increasing prevalence of MRSA infections, particularly in smokers. The researchers hope that their findings will provide another reason for individuals to quit smoking, as it can have devastating consequences for their health.\n\nIn a related study, researchers found that e-cigarette vapor also altered the structure of MRSA, making it more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species.

The site, which dates back to the Neolithic period, features a ditch and bank enclosure, and is thought to have been used for great gatherings and feasts. The site has already yielded a range of finds, including beautifully worked pottery, decorated with the residue of the last meals cooked in them, and the remains of a Roman complex.\n\nThe project is being led by Dr. Jim Leary, who believes that Marden Henge may have been the true center of activity in the area, rather than Stonehenge.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The United States is considering circulating a resolution at the United Nations to condemn the test.\n\nNorth Korea's actions have also led to a rift between its leader, Moon Jae-in, and US President Donald Trump. Trump has criticized Moon's approach to dealing with North Korea, saying that \"talking is not the answer.\" Moon, on the other hand, has advocated for more dialogue and diplomacy. The two leaders have agreed to lift current restrictions on South Korea's ballistic missiles, but the move has been criticized by some as a sign of weakness.\n\nThe international community has also been divided on how to respond to North Korea's actions.

{"pred": "A team of scientists has revived a 1962 proposal by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, which suggests that a civilization can harness energy from distant stars to become a universal power. According to Kardashev's theory, a civilization would first harvest energy from its own planet, then its star, and finally, the energy from all the stars in its galaxy. The civilization would then expand to other galaxies, allowing it to grow and thrive.\n\nRecently, a paper was published that added a new twist to Kardashev's theory. The paper suggests that a civilization would not only harvest energy from distant stars but also use it to accelerate the stars towards their home galaxy. This would allow the civilization to access the energy of stars that are currently inaccessible.\n\nThe paper also proposes that advanced civilizations would be able to detect the energy signatures of other civilizations by looking for unusual light signatures from distant galaxies. These signatures would be produced by the energy harvesting process and would be visible from Earth.\n\nThe concept of energy harvesting from distant stars is not new and has been explored in science fiction. In 1937, science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described a similar concept in his novel \"Star Maker.\" In 1960, physicist Freeman Dyson proposed a similar idea, suggesting that advanced civilizations would use energy from distant stars to power their civilization.\n\nThe concept of energy harvesting from distant stars is not only a theoretical concept but also a real possibility. The universe is expanding, and the stars in distant galaxies are moving away from us. If a civilization is able to harness the energy of these stars, it would be able to access energy that is currently inaccessible.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of energy harvesting from distant stars is a fascinating idea that has been explored in science fiction and is now being considered as a real possibility. The universe is vast and full of mysteries, and the possibility of energy harvesting from distant stars is just one of the many mysteries that scientists are working to uncover.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

{"pred": "Scientists have made significant discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, which date back to the Middle Stone Age, around 320,000 years ago. The findings suggest that the climate and environment were changing rapidly, with frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions, which would have made it difficult for early humans to adapt. To cope with these changes, humans likely developed new tools and technologies, such as smaller, more specialized stone tools made from obsidian, a volcanic glass, which was transported from as far away as 50 kilometers. The obsidian was used to make tools, such as spear points and blades, which were likely used for hunting and gathering. The team also found evidence of pigments, including red ochre, which was used to color rocks and possibly for symbolic purposes.\n\nThe discoveries suggest that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments and develop new technologies, which allowed them to survive and thrive. The findings also imply that early humans were able to form social networks and trade goods over long distances, which is a key characteristic of modern human societies.\n\nThe discoveries also challenge the idea that modern human behavior emerged suddenly around 50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that modern human behavior emerged gradually over hundreds of thousands of years, with early humans developing complex technologies and social networks in response to changing environments.\n\nThe findings also provide evidence of the earliest known evidence of long-distance trade and exchange of goods, including obsidian and pigments, which were transported from as far away as 50 kilometers. This suggests that early humans were able to form complex societies and trade networks, which is a key characteristic of modern human societies.\n\nOverall, the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide significant insights into the evolution of early humans and the development of complex societies, and challenge our understanding of the emergence of modern human behavior.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The ocean, which was at least 137 meters deep, existed around 4.5 billion years ago and was likely a result of the planet's warmer climate. The discovery was made by analyzing the composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which showed a significant enrichment of deuterium, a heavier form of hydrogen.\n\nThe research, led by NASA's Geronimo Villanueva, used data from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope to study the atmospheric maps of the Martian atmosphere. The team found that the water vapor in the atmosphere was enriched with deuterium, indicating that the planet had lost a significant amount of water over time.\n\nThe study suggests that the ocean on Mars was at least 137 meters deep and covered about 20% of the planet's surface. The researchers believe that the ocean was likely a result of the planet's warmer climate, which allowed for the formation of a large body of water. The discovery has significant implications for the search for life on Mars, as it suggests that the planet may have been habitable in the past.\n\nThe study also found that the planet's atmosphere has been losing water over time, with the ordinary hydrogen being lost to space.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Bayesian statistics, named after 18th-century minister Thomas Bayes, allows for the combination of multiple scenarios and uncertainties to determine the most likely location of the plane. In the case of Air France Flight 447, statisticians used Bayesian methods to locate the plane's wreckage, which was found in 2011.

The search has been complicated by the fact that the plane's communication systems were shut down, making it difficult to determine the cause of the disappearance. Bayesian statisticians have calculated the probability of the plane being in different areas, taking into account the probability of the plane being in a given location, the probability of the plane being in a certain state (e.g. crashed or not), and the probability of the search area being searched.

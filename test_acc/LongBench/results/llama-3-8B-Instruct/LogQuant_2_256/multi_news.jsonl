Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

The study found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods or later in pregnancy had a higher risk of their children developing ADHD-like behaviors.\n\nThe study's authors noted that the findings are based on observational data and do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD. However, they suggest that acetaminophen may interfere with the development of the brain, particularly during critical periods of fetal development.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that pregnant women avoid taking pain relievers, including acetaminophen, unless absolutely necessary.

The House of Representatives has passed a bill to fund federal agencies through Dec. 15, but with conditions, including a one-year delay in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and a repeal of the health law's medical device tax. The Senate is expected to reject the bill, and the House Speaker, John Boehner, has been under pressure from conservatives to pass a bill that defunds the ACA. The Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, has been urging the President to take a hard line against the House Republicans, and the White House has indicated that it will not compromise on the health law.\n\nThe shutdown could have significant consequences for the federal government, with over 700,000 federal workers potentially being furloughed and many government services and agencies being shut down. The Washington, D.C. area, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, could be particularly affected, with an estimated $200 million in daily losses and over 20% of the federal workforce being idled.\n\nThe shutdown could also have a significant impact on the local economy, with the potential for widespread layoffs and a loss of income for many federal contractors and workers. The possible shutdown has already led to a decline in consumer spending and a decrease in the number of new clinical trials being conducted at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe shutdown could also have a disproportionate impact on the Washington, D.C. area, with the potential for a near-total shutdown of government services and a significant decline in federal contracting. The area's economy is heavily reliant on federal spending, and a shutdown could lead to a significant decline in economic activity.\n\nIn conclusion, the government shutdown is a near-certainty, and the consequences could be severe.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission will be the first to fly directly to the sun, with a planned launch in July 2018. The spacecraft will travel to within 4 million miles of the sun's surface, closer than any previous spacecraft, and will study the sun's corona and solar wind. The probe will be protected by a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite heat shield and will have to withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.

The probe will also study the acceleration of solar wind and the heating of the corona, and will provide data on the solar wind's speed and direction.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

The planet is estimated to be five to ten times more massive than Earth and orbits the sun at a distance of about 10 to 20 times farther than Neptune.

They used mathematical modeling and computer simulations to predict the existence of the planet, which they believe is an icy, rocky world with a mass similar to that of Pluto.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about Pluto's status as a planet. Pluto was once considered the ninth planet in our solar system, but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. Brown, who was involved in the reclassification, believes that Pluto's status as a planet is not important and that the solar system is better understood with eight planets.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also led to renewed calls for Pluto to be reinstated as a planet. However, Brown believes that Pluto is not a planet and that it is better to consider it as an interesting member of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

{"pred": "A team of scientists has revived a 1962 proposal by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, which suggests that a civilization can harness energy from distant stars to become a universal power. According to Kardashev's theory, a civilization would first harvest energy from its own planet, then its star, and finally, all the stars in its galaxy. The civilization would then expand to other galaxies, allowing it to grow and thrive. \n\nRecently, a paper was published on the arXiv journal, which added a new twist to Kardashev's theory. The paper suggests that a civilization would not only harvest energy from distant stars but also use it to accelerate the stars towards their home galaxy. This would allow the civilization to access energy from stars that are currently inaccessible. \n\nThe paper also suggests that advanced civilizations would be able to detect the energy signatures of other civilizations by looking for unusual light signatures from distant galaxies. These signatures could be caused by the energy harvesting process, which would create a unique spectral signature. \n\nThe concept of energy harvesting from distant stars has been explored in science fiction, particularly in the works of Olaf Stapledon and Freeman Dyson. Stapledon described a civilization that harvested energy from stars in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\", while Dyson proposed the idea of a shell of satellites around a star in his 1960 paper. \n\nThe concept of energy harvesting has also been explored in the context of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "Scientists have made significant discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, which date back to the Middle Stone Age, around 320,000 years ago. The findings suggest that the climate and environment were changing rapidly, with frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions, which would have made it difficult for early humans to adapt. To cope with these changes, humans likely developed new tools and technologies, such as smaller, more specialized stone tools made from obsidian, a volcanic glass, which was transported from as far away as 50 kilometers. The obsidian was used to make tools, such as spear points and blades, which were likely used for hunting and gathering. The team also found evidence of pigments, including red ochre, which was used to color rocks and possibly for symbolic purposes.\n\nThe discoveries suggest that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments by developing new technologies and social networks. The team believes that the development of these technologies and social networks was driven by the need to cope with the unpredictable climate and the need to share information and resources with other groups. The findings also suggest that the development of modern human behavior, such as the use of symbols and long-distance trade, occurred earlier than previously thought.\n\nThe discoveries also challenge the idea that modern human behavior emerged suddenly around 50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that modern human behavior emerged gradually over a period of hundreds of thousands of years. The findings also suggest that the evolution of modern human behavior was not unique to Homo sapiens, but was shared by other human species.\n\nThe discoveries have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior. They suggest that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments and develop new technologies and social networks, which allowed them to survive and thrive in a challenging climate. The findings also highlight the importance of climate change and environmental factors in shaping human evolution and behavior.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

Israel had offered to hold its offensive to accommodate a visit from Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, provided Hamas held its fire as well. But Hamas said it would keep firing, and one Israeli defense minister complained that 50 rockets had flown in from Gaza during Kandil's visit, CNN reports. A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times.

Israel claims the attacks have weakened Hamas' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but Hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple Israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with Hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new Egyptian regime would be more active in helping the Palestinians. \"The time has changed,\" he said. \"No longer the Israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the Palestinians without being held responsible.

The ocean, which was at least 137 meters deep, was present on Mars around 4.5 billion years ago, during the planet's early years. This finding is based on the analysis of maps of atmospheric water and its deuterated form, which showed a significant enrichment of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere.\n\nThe study, led by NASA's Geronimo Villanueva, used data from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope to analyze the composition of water on Mars. The results showed that the planet's water was enriched with deuterium, indicating that the ordinary hydrogen had been lost over time. By studying the concentration of deuterium, the scientists were able to infer that the ocean on Mars was at least 137 meters deep and covered a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the planet. The presence of a large body of water on Mars in the distant past increases the chances of finding evidence of life on the planet. The study's findings also suggest that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, with a more stable climate than it is today.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars is part of a growing body of evidence that suggests the planet was once much more hospitable to life.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

{"pred": "Scientists have made a groundbreaking discovery that brings us one step closer to reading minds. Researchers from UC Berkeley have developed a technology that can reconstruct videos of what people are seeing, even if they are not actually watching the video. The technology uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to record the brain activity of individuals as they watch videos, and then uses that data to create a video of what they are seeing. This is a significant breakthrough, as it is the first time that scientists have been able to reconstruct dynamic, moving images from brain activity.\n\nThe technology works by using an algorithm to match the brain activity with the visual information being processed in the brain. The algorithm is able to create a video of what the person is seeing, even if they are not actually watching the video. The researchers were able to use this technology to reconstruct videos of people watching YouTube videos, and the results were surprisingly accurate.\n\nThis technology has the potential to be used in a variety of ways, including in the field of medicine. For example, it could be used to help people who are paralyzed or have other motor disorders to communicate. It could also be used to help people with memory loss or other cognitive impairments to recall memories. Additionally, the technology could be used in the field of law enforcement, allowing investigators to reconstruct what a person saw or experienced during a crime.\n\nThe researchers are excited about the potential of this technology and are already working on ways to improve it. They believe that it could be used to broadcast what people are seeing, even if they are not actually watching a video. This could be used to help people with visual impairments, such as blindness, to see what others are seeing. It could also be used to help people with other cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer's disease, to recall memories.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of a way to reconstruct videos of what people are seeing is a significant breakthrough that has the potential to revolutionize the field of neuroscience. The technology has many potential applications, and the researchers are excited to see where it will take them.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

Using the scans they were then able to reproduce the videos—though they’re blurry. “This is a major leap,” the co-author says. He thinks the technique could eventually be used to reconstruct dreams or memories, if it turns out the brain processes those things similarly to how it processes movies. “It’s our next line of research.” (More details on how the experiment worked, along with a video, at PC Magazine.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1188}

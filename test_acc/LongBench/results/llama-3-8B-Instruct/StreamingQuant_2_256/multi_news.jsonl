The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became four times more resistant to macrophages, the immune cells that typically kill bacteria. Additionally, the bacteria became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and were able to adhere better to human cells, making it easier for them to invade and cause disease.\n\nThe study suggests that cigarette smoke acts as an alarm to the bacteria, triggering a stress response that makes it more resistant to the immune system. This is a significant concern, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that can cause life-threatening infections, particularly in smokers.\n\nThe researchers also found that e-cigarette vapor had a similar effect on MRSA, but to a lesser extent.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The study, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011. The results showed that younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer and were more likely to undergo surgery and radiation therapy. Despite this, younger patients had a slightly better five-year survival rate than older patients.\n\nThe study suggests that the current guidelines for screening, which recommend starting at age 50, may need to be revised. Dr. Hendren notes that the findings are a \"wake-up call\" for the medical community to start considering the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients. The study also highlights the importance of early detection and treatment, as well as the need for more research on the causes of the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients.\n\nExperts agree that the findings are concerning, but some argue that it is too early to say whether the guidelines should be changed. Dr. David Weinberg notes that the study's findings are not clear-cut and that more research is needed to determine the best course of action.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site also challenges the assumption that the arid interior of Australia was uninhabitable for early humans, as the discovery of a spring and permanent water source suggests that the area was once more habitable.

{"pred": "Actor Tom Sizemore, 55, is accused of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl on the set of the 2003 film \"Born Killers\" in Utah. The alleged incident occurred during a photo shoot, where Sizemore allegedly touched the girl's genitals. The girl's parents declined to press charges, and Sizemore was allowed to continue working on the film. However, the incident was confirmed by multiple crew members, including the film's casting director, Catrine McGregor, who filed a complaint with the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nThe incident was previously unreported, but it has now come to light in the wake of the #MeToo movement. Sizemore has denied the allegations, but his agent and talent agency have dropped him. The film's producers also removed him from the set and told him to leave the project.\n\nSizemore has a history of drug use and has been convicted of battery against women in the past. He has also been accused of domestic violence and has pleaded no contest to battery charges. Despite this, he has continued to work in the industry, appearing in numerous films and TV shows.\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage and calls for accountability in the industry. Sizemore's alleged behavior is seen as a prime example of the kind of behavior that the #MeToo movement is trying to address. The film's producers have been criticized for allowing Sizemore to continue working on the film despite the allegations, and for not taking more action to protect the girl.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the industry's handling of sexual assault allegations.

{"pred": "The concept of habeas corpus, or the Great Writ, has been a cornerstone of Western law since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. It allows individuals to challenge their detention and demand evidence for their imprisonment. However, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006 revoked the right to habeas corpus for those detained at Guantánamo Bay and labeled as \"enemy combatants.\" This has led to indefinite detention without trial for many individuals.\n\nIn a recent development, a New York judge granted a writ of habeas corpus to two research chimps, Hercules and Leo, at Stony Brook University, allowing them to challenge their detention. This is the first time a court has recognized the right to habeas corpus for non-human animals. The ruling could potentially lead to the release of the chimps and other research animals from captivity.\n\nThe case is significant because it challenges the notion that humans have the right to detain and experiment on non-human animals without their consent. The Nonhuman Rights Project, which brought the case, hopes to use this ruling to sway judges in other jurisdictions to recognize the rights of non-human animals.\n\nIn a related development, the United States Constitution's habeas corpus provision has been used to challenge the detention of individuals at Guantánamo Bay.

Its revocation has raised concerns about the erosion of individual liberties and the potential for abuse of power by the executive branch.\n\nIn conclusion, the cases of the chimpans and the Guantánamo detainees highlight the importance of habeas corpus and the need to protect individual liberties.

The discovery was made by analyzing the composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which showed a significant enrichment of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\nThe research, led by NASA's Geronimo Villanueva, used data from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope to study the atmospheric maps of Mars. The team found that the ocean was likely formed when the planet's atmosphere was thicker and more humid, and that it covered a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for the search for life on Mars. The ocean would have provided a habitable environment for life to thrive, and the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere suggests that life may have existed on the planet. The study also suggests that Mars was once a more Earth-like planet, with a thicker atmosphere and a more stable climate.\n\nThe research has been met with excitement and skepticism from the scientific community.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The decision means that the Kit Kat bar's shape is no longer protected as a trademark in the EU, and could lead to other companies producing their own versions of the snack.\n\nThe dispute began in 2002, when Nestle applied for a trademark on the shape of the Kit Kat bar. Mondelez, the owner of the Cadbury brand, opposed the application, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be protected as a trademark. The EU's trademark office granted the trademark, but Mondelez appealed the decision, arguing that the shape was not distinctive in all EU countries.\n\nThe case has been ongoing for over a decade, with the EU's highest court finally ruling in favor of Mondelez. The decision means that the Kit Kat bar's shape is no longer protected as a trademark in the EU, and could lead to other companies producing their own versions of the snack.\n\nThe ruling has implications for the chocolate industry, as it sets a precedent for the protection of trademarks in the EU.

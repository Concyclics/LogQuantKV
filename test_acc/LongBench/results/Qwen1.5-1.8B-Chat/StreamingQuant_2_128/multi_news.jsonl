Kalashnikov was born in 1925 and grew up during the Soviet era, where the Red Army's lack of weapons led to a need for a reliable and affordable firearm. After receiving a letter from the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Kalashnikov expressed concerns about his moral responsibility for the deaths of thousands of people due to the AK-47's deadly capabilities. He wrote a lengthy emotional letter to the Patriarch Kirill, which revealed that he had previously refused to take responsibility for the deaths, attributing them to the policies of other countries acquiring the weapon. Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, confirmed that the priest who assisted her father in composing the letter played a role in the creation of the document. The letter was published in Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin newspaper, and was signed with a wavering hand. Kalashnikov's AK-47 assault rifle is considered one of the most popular and widely used firearms in the world, with over 100 million units sold worldwide. Despite his pride in the weapon's effectiveness, Kalashnikov acknowledged the tragic consequences of its use, particularly in the hands of criminals and child soldiers. The Russian Orthodox Church has since sought to solidify its position by supporting the designers and soldiers who utilize the weapon, emphasizing the importance of protecting the Fatherland and defending against terrorism.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears.

The first study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became significantly more resistant to the immune system, particularly macrophages, which are responsible for killing bacteria. The second study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, looked at the effects of e-cigarette vapor on MRSA resistance, with results indicating that the more exposed MRSA was to the vapor, the more resistant it became to antimicrobial peptides, which help to penetrate bacterial cell walls and cause inflammation. Both studies highlight the role of cigarette smoke in enhancing MRSA resistance and suggest that it may contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, potentially increasing the risk of infection and hospitalization for patients with MRSA. The findings suggest that cigarette smoke functions like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, triggering the bacterium to adapt and become more resistant to innate immune responses, such as macrophages. Additionally, the study highlights the altered structure of MRSA cells caused by cigarette smoke exposure, making it easier for the bacteria to invade human cells and cause pneumonia.

The CDC has identified 50 cases of AFM in 2016, compared to just 21 cases in 2015, suggesting a rise in the number of cases, particularly in children, during the summer months. The disease is caused by enteroviruses, which are common and usually affect children, but when they enter the nervous system, they can cause severe neurological issues. The disease has been associated with a similar outbreak in 2014, which was caused by a combination of enteroviruses and a respiratory illness.

The disease is characterized by symptoms such as pain in the arms and legs, an inability to pass urine, and severe respiratory issues, which can lead to respiratory failure and require urgent medical attention. The disease is caused by viruses that are common and can be spread through direct contact with infected individuals, such as through the mosquito-borne West Nile virus, which is also linked to AFM.

The first article details the incident involving Jane and Gary Wilson, who made a decision not to climb the summit despite warnings from their smartphone app, which suggested a more direct route down the west face. Instead, they relied solely on Mr. Wilson's phone to find a suitable route, leading to a dangerous fall that resulted in Mrs. Wilson's death. The second article highlights the response of the rescue team, including the involvement of the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team, who arrived at the scene after Mrs. Wilson's fall and pronounced her dead. The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death due to the lack of a clear route to avoid the summit and the reliance on a paper trail rather than an electronic map. The third article discusses the circumstances surrounding the fall, including the fact that the route chosen by the couple was not a straightforward path and that the lack of a paper trail may have contributed to the accident. The final article emphasizes the importance of using a paper trail and compass in addition to electronic navigation aids, as the image on the smartphone app may not provide enough detail for accurate navigation. The inquest concluded that Mrs. Wilson, a fitness enthusiast, had been actively involved in mountain activities for six years and had previously participated in the New York Marathon and Great North Run. The coroner's ruling emphasized the need for caution when navigating in the real world, especially when relying on digital maps and smartphones, and recommended using a paper trail or a combination of electronic and physical navigation tools.", "answers": ["A hiker's fatal fall in March has been blamed on using a smartphone app map instead of an actual map.

{"pred": "Seattle's new $1.75-cent-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages has sparked controversy and debate among residents and businesses alike. The tax was implemented in January 2018 to reduce sugar consumption, address obesity, and promote healthier choices. However, the tax has led to a hike in the price of soda and other sugary drinks, causing retailers like Costco to post signs indicating customers can purchase drinks outside the city limits without paying the tax. The Seattle City Council is considering a bill to remove the tax, but the beverage industry and other groups are opposed to the measure, arguing it will harm local businesses and drive out of town shoppers. The Seattle tax is seen as a way to encourage people to drink less sugary beverages and switch to healthier options, but critics argue that it will only benefit the wealthy and exacerbate existing inequalities. The tax has also raised concerns about the potential for unintended consequences, such as decreased sales and increased congestion in local communities. The tax is seen as a way to improve public health and reduce obesity rates, but opponents argue that it is unnecessary and will not necessarily lead to a reduction in overall calorie intake. The tax has also been criticized for triggering a backlash against the beverage industry, with some retailers and organizations opposing the tax and advocating for alternative solutions to address the issue. Overall, the Seattle tax on sweetened beverages has sparked a complex and contentious debate between businesses, residents, and policymakers, highlighting the importance of balancing public health goals with economic considerations and addressing the root causes of糖摄入过多 and unhealthy behaviors.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Senate Democrats have rejected the proposals, arguing that they should not be included in a spending bill without significant changes to the ACA. The Senate is expected to vote on a short-term funding bill to buy more time to pass a comprehensive healthcare bill, but the House is likely to reject it and push for a longer delay of the health law. The potential shutdown could have severe consequences for the federal government, including a loss of federal services, a decrease in tourism, and a disruption in the economy. The White House and Congress are expected to respond by making the decision to either pass a short-term funding bill or a longer delay of the health law. The potential shutdown could have a significant impact on the federal government, affecting the federal workforce, the economy, and the public services provided by the government.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The attack was carried out by a sophisticated group of criminals using a type of malware that allowed them to infiltrate the Point-of-Sale (POS) systems of Target stores, stealing sensitive data such as credit card numbers, encrypted PINs, and other personal information. The malware was able to bypass security measures and steal data without the need for physical access to the stores. The report from a computer firm hired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed that the attack was executed through a combination of software vulnerabilities and cunning tactics, making it difficult to trace the origin of the attack and identify the perpetrators. The report highlights the following:\n\n1. Software Code Proficiency: The targeted software was found to be highly sophisticated and capable of executing complex operations, which suggests a level of expertise in cybercrime and malware programming. This indicates that the attackers may have been proficient in exploiting vulnerabilities in Target's Point-of-Sales systems, allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the retailer's databases.\n\n2. Memory Scanning Capabilities: The malware utilized memory scraping techniques to extract data from the Point-of-Sales systems without encrypting the stored information. This method allows the attackers to capture and manipulate data without detection, potentially enabling them to steal sensitive information without revealing their true identity.\n\n3. Target's Response: Target initially notified customers about the breach on December 15, 2017, but the full extent of the attack was not fully contained until January 1, 2018, when the FBI confirmed the existence of the malware. The report notes that Target's response was slow, with the company waiting until January 1 to inform customers about the breach.\n\n4. Government Investigation: The authorities are currently conducting a joint investigation between the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, including those from Connecticut, New York, and Illinois, to determine if the two incidents are related and if they share any common characteristics. The report highlights the potential linkages between the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches, suggesting that the attacks may have originated in Eastern Europe, specifically Russia, where the software expertise and memory manipulation capabilities are well-established.\n\n5.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

The predominantly white Detroit Police Department was exonerated but not blameless, and the film \"Detroit\" is a powerful and disturbing portrayal of the events, focusing on the actions of the police officers responsible for the deaths of the three Black men. The film is set in 1967, during the riots, and the main character, a police officer named Krauss, is portrayed as a ruthless and violent individual who uses excessive force on Black men, leading to the deaths of two of them. The film also touches on the systemic racism and inequality in the United States, including the racial divide between the police and the community, and the impact of the riots on the lives of the victims. The film is not a simple character study, but rather a multi-layered exploration of the injustice and anger felt by the moment, especially for those who are still alive today. The film's depiction of the Algiers Motel siege, where the police officers brutalize the Black population, highlights the limitations of the film's storytelling approach, which leaves the central question unanswered. The film's title, \"Detroit,\" is a poignant reminder of the systemic issues faced by the Black community in the United States, and the film's rating of R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"strong violence and pervasive language\" adds to the controversy surrounding the film's release. The film's runtime of 143 minutes and the inclusion of three actors, including English actor Will Poulter, a Vietnam veteran, and a white couple, who visit Detroit, add depth to the story, but the film's focus on the central issue of the police brutality and the lack of insight into the victims' lives beyond the events depicted in the film is a critique of the film's inability to provide a complete understanding of the events.

{"pred": "The article discusses three steps that a civilization must take to dominate the universe in three easy steps: harvesting all of its planet's resources, harvesting all of its star's energy, and harvesting all of the energy from all the stars in its local galaxy. The author, astrophysicist and author of the paper, Kardashev, first proposed these three phases of technologically advanced civilizations in 1962, stating that the increasing energy consumption of such civilizations would lead to the expansion of the universe. He added a new twist in the paper, proposing that the presence of dark energy in the universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate, making it necessary for civilizations to expand throughout the universe to ensure their survival. The author argues that any advanced civilization that captures energy from distant stars will not only be able to control the universe but also be able to extract energy to power itself, making it the only way to avoid becoming completely isolated in the vastness of space. The paper adds a new twist by suggesting that advanced civilizations would create a spherical shell around a star, using a swarm of satellites to capture and harness the energy of the star to propel the entire ball of energy back to the planet that wants to use it. The paper proposes three types of civilizations, each with different levels of technological advancement, and suggests that a civilization of advanced civilizations would be of three types: a Type I civilization that harnesses all the resources of a planet, a Type II civilization that harnesses all the energy of a star, and a Type III civilization that harnesses all the energy of all the stars in its own galaxy. The paper also mentions that the existence of advanced civilizations would depend on the size of the star they want to extract energy from, with Type II civilizations having a higher chance of being able to access the energy due to their proximity to the universe, while Type III civilizations would require a more extensive amount of materials to build a stable satellite around a star. The paper also highlights the potential for advanced civilizations to create a \"statite\" structure around a star, consisting of a swarm of satellites that collect and store energy, and then beam the energy back to the planet that wants to use it. The article concludes by discussing the challenges of detecting the presence of advanced civilizations in the future, with the light signature of a civilization being dominated by massive stars and reaching longer wavelengths than previously observed. The article emphasizes the importance of developing instruments to detect such signals, as humans may not have precise instruments yet to identify such signals.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

Instead, Apple introduced the proprietary Lightning connector, which requires an iCloud account and is designed to provide a superior audio experience over other wireless options such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and USB cables. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus require an iCloud account to connect to their respective devices, and the company claims that the Lightning connector provides a \"better sound quality\" compared to the previous standard audio interface. The Lightning connector is a proprietary technology developed by Apple, and it is not available on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The company's decision to remove the 30-pin connector and the Lightning connector is seen as a sign of arrogance and greed, as it eliminates a widely used and accepted standard. The company's move is also seen as a lack of consideration for users who rely on the traditional audio interface, as it limits the ability to charge the device while simultaneously listening to music. The removal of the 30-pin connector and Lightning connector is a significant step backward for Apple, as it moves away from the \"we\" in the company's slogan, \"it just works.\" The move is also seen as a lack of innovation and a retreat into a proprietary system, rather than moving forward with new technologies. The Lightning connector is a costly solution that requires an iCloud account, and the company is charging customers for the privilege, which is perceived as a form of greed.

The new system, which will be implemented in all United gates, will feature two lanes for boarding, with the first two lanes reserved for premium and elite passengers, while the remaining lanes will be for regular customers. Passengers will be called to board using a color-coded system, with the first two groups (Group 1 and 2) being called first, followed by Group 3, 4, and 5. The airline is encouraging passengers to wait until their boarding group is called, rather than standing in line, to avoid congestion and ensure timely departures. The airline expects the new boarding process to help alleviate congestion and improve the overall boarding experience for customers. The new system is part of a larger effort to improve the airline's boarding process and reduce the number of empty lanes, which can lead to increased competition and higher consumer benefits. The new boarding process follows the same principles as United's previous five lanes, which served more than 12,000 passengers per day and led to idle stands and congestion at gateways. The goal is to provide a more efficient and streamlined boarding experience for customers, reducing the need for standing and improving the flow of passengers. The new boarding process is expected to reduce congestion and improve the boarding experience for passengers, leading to increased traffic and economic development, and better customer service. The new process is part of a broader effort by United and its partners to offer more than 12,000 city pairs, integrated, and seamless service. The agreement between United, Copa, and other airlines is expected to add Brazil to the list of countries eligible for the agreement, which could lead to additional competition and value for customers.

Cruz, who was a troublemaker and often violent, was placed in Hooper's classroom for five years, where he became a beloved figure due to his disruptive behavior. Despite being warned multiple times about his behavior, Hooper gave him a chance to learn and grow, and the two bonded. However, when Cruz's mother asked for his permission to change his name to Hooper, Hooper realized that she had made the right decision. The couple adopted Cruz as their own, and the transition was challenging, but they were determined to raise him as their own. Over the years, Hooper and her husband, Gale, worked together to provide a stable environment for Cruz, helping him with homework and providing him with a new identity. The couple's decision to adopt Cruz as their own was met with opposition from some members of the family, but they remained committed to raising him as their own.

But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated.

The Non-human Rights Project, a nonprofit organization, has filed a lawsuit in New York state court, arguing that the chimpanzees should be released to a sanctuary where they can live freely. The case has gained significant attention due to the unique nature of the situation, as the chimpanzees are being held in a facility that is not a traditional prison, but rather a laboratory run by Stony Brook University. The Non-human Rights Project claims that the chimpanzees are legally entitled to bodily liberty and that the court's decision to grant them habeas corpus will help establish their legal status. The court has asked the university to appear in court to respond to the lawsuit, and the university has not yet responded. The case has sparked a renewed interest in the concept of habeas corpus, which protects individuals from being unjustly imprisoned without sufficient cause. The Non-human Rights Project hopes that the ruling will lead to the release of the chimpanzees and other animals to establish their legal personhood, allowing them to exercise their basic rights such as bodily liberty and access to a sanctuary.

The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, was arrested in Tennessee in August 2011 during a raid on Gibson's manufacturing facility. The government claims that Gibson knowingly sourced illegally harvested wood from Madagascar, a country known for its high demand for exotic woods such as rosewood and ebony. The government alleges that Gibson provided false information about the trip to Madagascar, stating that the trip was designed to understand if there were opportunities for good wood sourcing, but in reality, the company's executives knew that the government would seize legally obtained wood from the country. The government has accused Gibson of trafficking in illegally obtained wood, including a shipment of ebony from Madagascar in 2009. The government has filed a lawsuit against Gibson and the company, alleging that Gibson's imports of illegally harvested wood violate the Lacey Act, a century-old law that was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. The government argues that Gibson's operations violated the law by maintaining a supply chain that was connected to illegal logging, and that the company has not yet been charged with violating the law. The government has also claimed that Gibson's imports of illegally harvested wood from Madagascar were a violation of the Lacey Act, which requires end users of endangered wood to verify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. The government has stated that it will charge Gibson and the company with trafficking in illegally obtained wood, and that the company has not yet been able to provide evidence of compliance with the law. The government has also expressed concerns about the impact of the Lacey Act on guitar manufacturers who rely on the wood for their products. The government has warned guitar manufacturers to be cautious of traveling abroad with old guitars, as they may be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The government has also defended the Lacey Act, arguing that it is necessary to reduce illegal logging and send a message that illegal logging must be stopped.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

The ancient ocean on Mars was estimated to have covered 450 meters deep, which is about 137 meters higher than the current ocean level on Earth. The study analyzed the Martian atmosphere's water vapor, which is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. The data suggests that Mars had a higher proportion of deuterium than Earth, with seven times the amount of deuterium present in the Martian atmosphere compared to Earth's ocean. The study also found that the water on Mars was lost to space over time, leading to a significant loss of water equivalent to approximately six times the current ocean volume on Earth's oceans.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer program that uses brain activity patterns to reconstruct YouTube videos, a previously unattainable task in the realm of visual perception. The study involved recording brain activity during the viewing of two sets of YouTube videos, which were then processed using a machine learning algorithm to identify similarities between neural activity and the videos. The resulting reconstructed videos, known as \"virtual reconstructions,\" feature blurriness due to layers of overlapping content, highlighting the dynamic nature of visual experiences.

The study's findings suggest that the technology could potentially be applied in various fields, including criminal justice, where it could enable individuals to control their environment through imagined sequences of actions.

It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time. They changed their findings, and presto, the plane was found.

For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night.

The study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington's Seattle-based research center, provides the most comprehensive overview of obesity worldwide over the past 188 years. The report shows that obesity rates have risen across all continents, with the highest rates occurring in the Middle East and North Africa, followed by Asia, where obesity rates are particularly high. In the United States, obesity rates have increased significantly, with 13% of the population being obese, while another 13% are obese. The report also highlights the impact of obesity on various health risks, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study found that obesity rates have increased in both developed and developing countries, with obesity rates in wealthy countries reaching 13% and those in developing countries reaching 28%, with the United States having the highest obesity rate at 13%. The report also notes that obesity is a major risk factor for chronic illnesses, with 22% of adults in developed countries and 13% of children and adolescents being obese, while 24% of adults and 13% of children and adolescents being obese in developing countries. The study concludes that obesity is a global public health crisis, affecting nearly 30% of the world's population, and that no country has successfully reduced obesity rates. The report suggests that obesity is driven by factors such as cheap, unhealthy food options, sedentary lifestyles, and the rise of obesity-related risk factors like sedentary lifestyles and the availability of affordable junk food.

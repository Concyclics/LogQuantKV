Kalashnikov was born in 1925 and grew up during the Soviet era, where the Red Army's lack of weapons led to a need for a reliable and affordable firearm. After the war, Kalashnikov became fascinated by the AK-47 and began working on the design of the weapon, which he saw as a way to defend his country and its people. He initially went to a church to seek guidance and inspiration, and later became a baptized Christian. In 1999, Kalashnikov wrote a lengthy emotional letter to the Russian Orthodox Church's Patriarch, expressing his spiritual pain over the many deaths caused by the AK-47. The letter was published in Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin newspaper, and was signed with a wavering hand. Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, confirmed that the priest who helped her father compose the letter had also read the letter. The letter details Kalashnikov's thoughts on the morality of his actions and the reasons behind his decision to design the AK-47, stating that he believed he was morally responsible for the deaths of innocent civilians. The letter also touches on Kalashnikov's views on the role of the AK-47 in defending his country and the fact that it has been widely used by armed groups, including those using child soldiers.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

Ciancia was initially treated as a suspect and placed in a secure holding area before being transported to a hospital, where he remained in good condition. However, he later died due to severe blood loss and trauma. The incident sparked widespread outrage and calls for increased safety measures at airports, including better coordination between law enforcement agencies and improved emergency response protocols. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) conducted a joint investigation into the shooting, which resulted in the arrest of Ciancia and the subsequent death of two other individuals.

McCullough's conviction was based on a flawed timeline that was altered to exclude his alibi, according to a judge's ruling. McCullough's defense team argued that the evidence against him was insufficient and that he was not capable of committing the crime due to his distance from the scene of the crime and his claim of being in Rockford, Illinois, discussing with recruiters and enlisting in the Air Force at the time of the abduction. However, the judge found that the evidence presented was sufficient to prove McCullough's guilt, and he ruled that he was not guilty. McCullough's family expressed disbelief and vowed to continue fighting the case, leading to a renewed investigation by the Illinois State Police and a six-month investigation by the DeKalb County State's Attorney, Richard Schmack, who found that McCullough's alibi was not credible.

The cloth, which is believed to depict the image of a crucified man, has been analyzed using radiocarbon dating, which determined its origin to be between 1260 and 1390 CE. The researchers used a living subject and a mannequin to examine the flow of blood on wounds on the left hand, the forearm, the \"lance\" of the image, and the bloodstains on the cloth. The bloodstain pattern analysis revealed that the bloodstains are inconsistent with each other, indicating that the cloth may have been made by a standing model rather than a crucified man or a face-down corpse. The researchers concluded that the cloth is a medieval forgery, possibly due to a mix of human blood and iron oxide, a pigment or a mixture of bloodstains. The researchers tested the flow of blood on the cloth using a living subject and a mannequin, finding that the bloodstains were inconsistent with each other, suggesting that the cloth may not be authentic. The researchers also observed that the bloodstains on the cloth appeared to be inconsistent with the actual position of the body on the Shroud of Turin, which is a medieval relic.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The discovery provides insights into the gender of the child, diet, and pathologies, as well as the date of burial. The excavation team, led by Dr. Jim Leary, director of the archaeology summer school, has been working on the site since June 2021, uncovering finds such as flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch. The team has also discovered a previously unknown Roman complex, including the foundation of a barn, which was recently levelled by a farmer. The discovery of the Bronze Age skeleton adds to the understanding of the people who lived in the area surrounding Stonehenge, providing insight into their diet, gender, and burial practices. The excavation team's findings will help identify protected sites and improve management of the site, focusing on the study of the henge and its relationship to the River Avon.

{"pred": "Three separate news articles report on the tragic death of a woman named Jane Marshall, who fell while attempting to reach the summit of Snowdonia's Tryfan peak. The incident occurred on March 25, 2023, when Jane and her husband Gary Wilson decided not to go to the summit due to concerns about the loose rocks and steep inclines on the west face. Instead, they used Mr. Wilson's smartphone to navigate the route, leading him to a suitable route that involved crossing the west face of the mountain. However, Mrs. Marshall fell 20-30 feet down a vertical cliff, resulting in a severe injury. The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death, stating that Mrs. Marshall was a fit and active woman who had been mountain walking and scrambling for six years. The incident was reported by the coroner as an attempt to avoid the summit, with the couple having retreated the same way they came down the mountain, but ultimately descending through a less-traditional route. The Ordnance Survey app on Mr. Wilson's smartphone may have contributed to the error in navigation, as the image displayed on the app was not as detailed as a proper map. The incident prompted the rescue team to respond, with Mr. Bird describing the route change as an attempt to avoid the summit and recommending caution in future climbs. The incident highlights the importance of carrying a paper copy of the place being explored and avoiding the use of electronic navigation apps, especially in challenging outdoor environments like snow-covered mountains. The coroner concluded that Mrs. Marshall's death was accidental, and the rescue team's response was focused on retracing the route to avoid a more traditional approach.

The tax was introduced in 2017 to encourage healthier choices and reduce sugar intake, but it has led to a hike in prices and decreased sales at major retailers like Costco. The Seattle City Council ultimately approved the tax, but it has faced criticism from some who argue that it targets low-income communities and disproportionately affects healthy foods. The tax applies to beverages that list milk as their first ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages, and is set to rise to $26.33 per ounce. The tax has also impacted Seattle's beverage industry, with many retailers experiencing reduced sales and customers turning to alternative options. The tax is expected to generate revenue for Seattle, but it has also resulted in increased costs for businesses and potential job losses. The Seattle City Council is currently reviewing the tax's effectiveness and considering alternatives to address concerns about the burden on local businesses and the well-being of the community. The tax is seen as a step towards reducing sugar consumption and promoting healthier choices, but it remains to be seen whether it will have the desired impact on individuals' behavior and overall health.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The attack involved a type of malware that targeted Point-of-Sale (POS) systems, specifically those in the Russian-speaking region. The malware was able to infiltrate the Target stores through a series of steps, starting with a point-of-sale system vulnerability that allowed the attackers to steal sensitive information such as credit card numbers, encrypted PINs, and other personal data. The malware was able to bypass security measures and access the point-of-sale systems without the knowledge of the retailer. The report from a computer firm hired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed that the malware was developed in Russia and was capable of stealing data from memory in the POS systems. The report also detailed the types of software used by the attackers, including memory scraping capabilities, which allowed them to extract data from encrypted point-of-sale transactions without the need for physical access to the system. The report concluded that the attack was a sophisticated effort by cybercriminals in Eastern Europe, and that the number of affected individuals and the extent of the breach could potentially lead to increased losses for retailers like Target. The report highlights the importance of ongoing government and private sector cooperation in investigating and preventing future cyber attacks, particularly in the context of large-scale retail breaches. The report recommends that retailers implement additional security measures, such as encryption and multi-factor authentication, to protect their systems from potential cyber threats. Additionally, the report suggests that the government should investigate the origins of the malware and work with law enforcement agencies to identify the perpetrators and hold them accountable for the breach.

The Kenyan Wildlife Service confirmed that the lion was killed in a wildlife management area outside the park's southern section, which is not fenced, and that the lion was attempting to establish new territory. The incident highlights the challenges faced by wildlife officials in managing large populations of lions, which have declined dramatically due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflicts with livestock herders. The incident also underscores the need for effective communication and collaboration between wildlife officials, local communities, and conservationists to address the issue of lion attacks and protect both humans and wildlife. The Kenyan government is currently considering different options, including capturing the lion and relocating it to a protected area, but the killing of the lion in Kenya raises concerns about the potential impact on the lion's behavior and the risk of further attacks.

The reliquary, which is only about 2.2 centimeters long, is adorned with crosses and has a similar design to other known lead tube reliquaries from Ephesus, suggesting a connection to the cult for St. John the Theologian (John the Apostle).

The rebellion against Gaddafi began in late August, with the detention of Muneer Masud Moushida, a 30-year-old man who worked as a mechanic. The rebellion gained momentum when the 30th Brigade, led by Gaddafi's son, refused to release the detainees, leading to a series of brutal attacks and deaths.

The study analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute's National Cancer Registry from 1998 to 2011 and found that 37,847 out of 258,000 colorectal cancer patients were younger than 50, with 15% of these patients being younger than 40. The study highlights the importance of early detection and screening for young patients, particularly those with advanced-stage cancer, as well as the need for improved risk assessment and screening guidelines. The study estimates that by 2030, one in four colorectal cancers will be diagnosed in younger patients, and the proportion of younger patients with advanced-stage cancer is expected to increase. The study also notes that younger patients tend to have more aggressive diseases, resulting in better survival rates with aggressive treatments, but the study does not address the role of family history, risk factors, and other factors in determining screening recommendations. The study recommends that guidelines for screening be adjusted to start at a younger age, with the aim of improving disease prevention and reducing the number of cancer deaths.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The predominantly white Detroit Police Department was exonerated but not blameless, and the film \"Detroit\" is a powerful and disturbing portrayal of the violence and injustice that still exists today. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the film follows the story of the Algiers Motel siege, where the police officers who killed the three Black men were acquitted but then subjected to inhumane torture and murder. The film is set in 1967, during the riots, and Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal's script emphasizes the systemic racism and violence that existed in the city, including the racist behavior of the officers who killed the three Black men. The film is an all-out assault on the viewer's senses and emotions, with a gripping storyline that leaves a lasting impact. The film's central antagonist, Officer Krauss, is portrayed as a hotheaded, violent cop who ultimately becomes the central antagonist of the Algiers Motel siege. The film is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for its strong violence and pervasive language, and it's not for those looking for a simple character study. The film's main focus is on the systemic racism and injustice that persists in the United States, making it a timely and relevant film for anyone interested in understanding the past and addressing the ongoing issues.", "answers": ["Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit tells the story of a black singer who takes refuge in a dingy motel to escape the 1967 Motor City riots.

The board held meetings over the past few weeks to discuss the potential benefits of being a private company, including addressing the funding for the transaction. Musk's tweet on Tuesday revealed that he had the required funding to secure the deal, which would value the company at $70bn, making it the largest-ever private acquisition in history. The board members, including Tesla's current CEO, Chief Operating Officer, and six independent directors, expressed satisfaction with the discussions surrounding the proposal, stating that it would better serve Tesla's long-term interests and provide sufficient funding for the acquisition. However, the board's statement also raised questions about the timing and the board's satisfaction with Musk's method and timing, particularly regarding the timing of the announcement.

The author, astrophysicist and senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, proposes that the presence of dark energy in the universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate, making it necessary for advanced civilizations to expand throughout the universe and capture energy from other galaxies. The author adds a new twist by stating that the absence of energy from the universe will limit the amount of energy a civilization can extract, making it necessary to capture and harvest stars from other galaxies to ensure that they can meet the energy requirements of a civilization. The author suggests that any civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will expand throughout the universe, using a massive array of satellites called \"Dyson spheres\" to capture and haul back to the home galaxy. The author notes that such a civilization would understand the grim reality of the universe and would not simply sit idle while the universe passes them by, but rather would actively pursue the goal of capturing and utilizing energy from other stars to accelerate the entire ball of fire back toward the planet that wants to use it. The author explains that the existence of advanced civilizations with a star-harvesting civilization would be thousands or even millions of years older than ours, and that they would not just sit idly while the universe passes them by, but would capture and harvest stars from other galaxies to ensure that they can meet the energy requirements of a civilization. The author notes that the existence of massive stars and their proximity to the universe would make them ideal targets for capturing and harnessed energy, and that the light signature from a galaxy that has had its useful stars removed by an advanced civilization would be detected through the light emitted by the stars themselves. The article highlights the importance of understanding the inevitability of the encroaching horizon due to the expansion of the universe, and the potential for advanced civilizations to capture and utilize energy from other stars to achieve their goals. The article also mentions the possibility of advanced civilizations having reached the level of a Type III civilization, where they would harness all of the energy of a galaxy, and the possibility of a massive, spherical structure around a star being created by a civilization.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

The new system, which will be implemented in all United gates, will feature two lanes for boarding, with the first two lanes reserved for premium and elite passengers, while the remaining lanes will be for regular customers. Passengers will be called to board using a color-coded system, with the first two groups (Group 1 and 2) being called first, followed by Group 3, 4, and 5.

Kieran's parents, Kieran Sorkin and Louise, were overjoyed with the results and expressed their gratitude to the doctors and nurses at the hospital for their expertise and dedication to helping Kieran feel like a normal child again. Kieran's difficulties at school were addressed by moving him to a school with a deafness unit, which has helped him develop confidence and social skills.

The NhRP's efforts to secure the legal recognition of chimpanzees' right to habeas corpus have sparked renewed interest in the case and may influence other courts to consider granting similar relief to other animals in captivity. The NhRP's victory underscores the need to protect the rights of animals and ensure that they are not subjected to arbitrary imprisonment without due process.", "answers": ["The writ of habeas corpus lets prisoners appear in court to make their captors justify why they're being held. Until now in the US, those who've used this legal tactic have been human. But a New York judge yesterday ruled that the writ may be used by two lab chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, Science magazine reports. NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

The company claims that it sources its wood from legally harvested forests, but the government argues that the company has violated the Lacey Act, a century-old law that regulates the export of endangered wood. The Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to verify the legality of their supply chain, including obtaining government stamps or certifications, which the Gibson Guitar Corporation did not do during its Madagascar visit in 2011. The government has charged the company with trafficking in illegally obtained wood, alleging that it knew about the risks involved and chose to source illegally obtained woods from Madagascar. The company maintains that it sources its wood from legally harvested forests and has provided documents to support its claim. However, the government has not yet confirmed the exact violation of the Lacey Act, and the company is appealing the case in court. The Lacey Act is a century-old law that requires end users of endangered wood to verify the legality of their supply chain, and the government has accused the company of violating the law by sourcing illegally obtained wood from Madagascar. The government has also claimed that the company's imports from Madagascar violate the 1990s ban on the export of ebony and rosewood, which led to the coup in Madagascar and the subsequent changes in government policies. The government has created exemptions for vintage instruments, but many guitar makers are hesitant to use them due to the potential for delays and the risk of losing market share. The government has urged guitar manufacturers to question the authenticity of their wood and ensure it comes from legally harvested forests.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India.

The ancient ocean covering a fifth of the planet's surface, with a depth of at least 450 feet (137 meters), was discovered by analyzing the water vapor present in the Martian atmosphere. The data suggests that Mars had a much greater water loss than previously thought, with a high D/H ratio of about seven times that of Earth's ocean. The study also reveals that the Martian water was enriched by a factor of eight, indicating a significant water loss. The water in the Martian atmosphere was lost due to the planet's thinner atmosphere, which allowed water molecules to escape into space. The study estimates that the ancient ocean on Mars covered a significant part of the planet's surface, with a depth of at least 450 feet, and that it may have been able to support life on the planet.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

{"pred": "Two recent studies have revealed a breakthrough in the ability to read the inner workings of the human mind through brain activity analysis. Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer program that uses brain activity patterns to reconstruct YouTube videos, a previously unattainable task. The study involved recording brain activity during the viewing of two sets of YouTube videos, which were then processed using a machine learning algorithm to identify similarities between neural activity and the videos. The resulting videos were then reconstructed using a technique called \"virtual reality\" where the brain's visual processing is layered onto a series of videos, creating a dreamlike, abstract representation of the original videos. The study, published in the journal Current Biology, has significant implications for understanding the brain's ability to process dynamic visual experiences, including dreams, memories, and even the contents of one's imagination. The technology holds promise for future applications, such as monitoring brain activity to detect and interpret visual content, potentially enabling the decoding of subconscious thoughts and emotions, as well as the manipulation of visual stimuli for purposes beyond entertainment. However, the technology's accuracy and limitations remain to be determined, particularly when it comes to capturing the full range of visual information and interpreting the content of memories and dreams. Additionally, the technology's potential use in court proceedings is limited due to the nature of memory and the subjective nature of perception, making it challenging to accurately replicate the intended meaning behind a person's memory or imagination.

{"pred": "The article discusses the alarming trend of obesity, which affects millions of people worldwide, accounting for 2.1 billion people, or 13% of the global population, according to a new study published in the Lancet. The study, titled \"World Obesity Report,\" provides a comprehensive overview of obesity trends over the past three decades, revealing that obesity rates have risen across all regions, with the highest rates occurring in the Middle East and North Africa, followed by Asia, and then the Americas. The study found that obesity disproportionately affects men and women, with 28% of the adult population in the Middle East and North Africa being obese, compared to 47% in the US, where only 5% of the population is obese. The study also highlights the impact of obesity on various health risks, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer, affecting approximately 3.4 million adults per year. The obesity rate has increased significantly since 1980, with 2.1 billion people being overweight or obese, representing 13% of the global population. The study also finds that obesity rates are particularly prevalent in wealthy countries like the United States, with 13% of the population, while the US accounts for only 5% of the population. The study emphasizes the importance of addressing obesity, with the World Health Organization launching a commission to study rising obesity worldwide and identify potential causes, including changes in diet composition, reduced physical activity, and shifts in the gut microbiome in modern times. The report concludes that obesity is a global public health crisis, with no single country achieving a significant reduction in obesity rates. The study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to address obesity, including reducing unhealthy diets, promoting physical activity, and improving access to healthy foods. The authors note that obesity rates are rising in both developed and developing countries, with the majority of the world's population experiencing obesity, highlighting the need for action to tackle the issue.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

The Brotherhood's victory is seen as a sign of support for the country's moderate Islamist groups, including the Egyptian Bloc alliance, which includes the Free Egyptians and the social-democratic parties. The Brotherhood's campaign focused on appealing to the secular and progressive voices in the country, while the military rulers have yet to specify the mechanism for allocating seats among parties based on their share of votes. The final results are expected to highlight the control of the military and the influence of the Brotherhood, with the possibility of a new government formation and the emergence of a new era of political struggles.

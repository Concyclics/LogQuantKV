{"pred": "The article discusses the life and legacy of Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the iconic AK-47 assault rifle. Kalashnikov, born in 1925 in Russia, developed the rifle during World War II, which saw the Red Army's severe shortage of weapons. After the war, Kalashnikov became disillusioned with the Soviet government's policies and began working on a more efficient and effective military solution. He eventually founded the Kalashnikov Design Bureau, where he worked on developing the AK-47, a semi-automatic rifle that revolutionized the battlefield.\n\nKalashnikov's work on the AK-47 earned him numerous accolades, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour. However, his reputation was tarnished when he faced criticism for his involvement in the mass murder of civilians during the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. According to a leaked letter written by Kalashnikov to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, he expressed remorse for the deaths of innocent people and felt morally responsible for the weapon's use.\n\nDespite his guilt, Kalashnikov maintained a strong connection to his faith and religion throughout his life. He was baptized at a young age and attended church regularly. In his letter to the Patriarch, Kalashnikov explained that he initially intended to create the AK-47 as a means of defending his country, not as a tool for terrorism. However, the widespread adoption of the rifle by armed groups, particularly in the Middle East, led to its use by criminals and child soldiers.\n\nThe article also highlights the role of the Russian Orthodox Church in shaping Kalashnikov's beliefs and values. The Church's position was clear: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use them. This stance contrasted with Kalashnikov's previous atheistic beliefs, which may have contributed to his guilt about the AK-47's use.\n\nAfter Kalashnikov's death in December 2009, his funeral was attended by President Vladimir Putin, marking a significant moment for the Russian Orthodox Church and the nation. The Church's response to Kalashnikov's letter reflects its commitment to preserving the memory of the fallen hero while acknowledging the complexities of his actions. The Church's press secretary, Alexander Volkov, stated that the Church had a clear position on the matter and supported the use of the AK-47 to defend the Fatherland.\n\nOverall", "answers": ["In our own obituary of AK-47 inventor Mikhail Kalashnikov last month, we included this quote: The rifle was invented \"for the protection of the Motherland,\" he said. \"I have no regrets and bear no responsibility for how politicians have used it.\" It turns out \"no regrets\" might not have exactly been true. The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

The first study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego School of Medicine, found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became more resistant to the immune system's defenses, particularly macrophages, which are responsible for eliminating bacteria. The study involved testing two groups of MRSA, one exposed to cigarette smoke extract and one not, to determine the impact of the smoke on the bacteria's ability to evade the immune system. The results showed that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA, indicating that cigarette smoke may contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of the bacteria.\n\nIn contrast, a second study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, focused on the effects of e-cigarette vapor on bacterial resistance. The study found that MRSA exposed to e-cigarette vapor became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are proteins that can penetrate bacterial cell walls and cause inflammation. The researchers observed that the increased resistance persisted for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be passed down through genetic mutations.\n\nBoth studies highlight the importance of understanding the role of cigarette smoke in enhancing the virulence of MRSA. The first study suggests that cigarette smoke may contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of the bacteria by altering the cell walls of the bacteria, making it more resistant to host innate immune killing mechanisms and the ability to cause pneumonia in mice. The second study highlights the potential for e-cigarette vapor to exacerbate the problem, as it can alter the structure of MRSA's cell wall, making it more resistant to bacteria.\n\nThese findings raise concerns about the potential consequences of smoking-related infections, particularly those caused by MRSA. The increased resistance to antibiotics and the ability to cause pneumonia in mice suggest that smoking may contribute to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing a significant threat to public health. As such, further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between cigarette smoke and MRSA and develop effective strategies to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic-resistant infections.

However, the study also revealed that each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, leading to a bias towards local figures. The researchers applied a second way of measuring importance, CheiRank, which measures the PageRank of an article based on the number of incoming links and the number of outgoing links. They found that the most influential person in the world was Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, who invented the scientific system of naming that is still in use today.

Since January 1, 2016, the CDC has confirmed 50 cases of AFM in 24 states, compared to just 21 cases in 2015. The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to viral infections, including enteroviruses, which are common and can cause mild illnesses in children. The symptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The best way to prevent AFM is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM. The illness peaked in 2014, with 120 cases reported between August and December, and the average age for children affected by AFM is 7. The median age of patients was 7.6 years, and 54% were males. Limb weakness was asymmetrical in most cases, and cranial nerve motor dysfunction was reported in 30% cases. Six (7%) patients had altered mental status, and three (3%) had seizures. Most patients reported a respiratory illness, a febrile illness, or both, occurring before neurologic symptom onset, and 8% had neither condition. Among 86 patients for whom past medical history was reported, 65% were previously healthy, and 21% had underlying illnesses, most commonly asthma (nine%). All but one patient was hospitalized because of neurologic illness, and 17% required ventilator support. Among 80 patients from whom cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, 68% showed a moderate pleocytosis and normal or mildly elevated protein. Laboratory testing for other pathogens is ongoing. The CDC has issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing. The agency continues to collaborate with partners nationally to investigate reported cases, risk factors, and possible etiologies of this condition.

{"pred": "The Shroud of Turin, a centuries-old artifact believed to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, has been subjected to a new forensic investigation by researchers who claim it contains inconsistencies in its bloodstain pattern. The shroud, which is currently displayed in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, has been radiocarbon dated to between 1260 and 1390 CE, making it a likely candidate for the crucifixion of Jesus. The researchers, led by Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, used real and synthetic blood samples to analyze the bloodstains on the left-hand side of the cloth, comparing them to the images of a standing model versus a crucified man or a face-down corpse. The results showed that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any single pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprints the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The investigators also tested the flow of blood on the left-hand side of the cloth, finding that the trickles from the hand and the flow along the arm occurred at two completely different angles, indicating that the shroud may not have been a crucified man or a face-down corpse. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse, adding to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The investigation has sparked renewed interest in the shroud's authenticity, with some experts questioning the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating and the bloodstain pattern analysis. The findings of the forensic investigation have been published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, raising questions about the true nature of the shroud and the possibility of alternative explanations for its appearance.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The show featured the hosts' irreverent humor and unconventional recipes, and Dickson Wright was known for her passion for hunting and shooting, as well as her advocacy for vegetarianism. She was a talented cook and a fierce advocate for traditional British cuisine, particularly the humble carrot. Despite her success on television, Dickson Wright struggled with alcoholism and was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2009. She continued to work as a consultant for the Countryside Alliance and was involved in various campaigns for rural life. Her passing was mourned by her colleagues and fans alike, who remembered her as a brilliant cook, a passionate foodie, and a champion of hunting and shooting.

The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\" It wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously. As for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame? \"If you're fat you're fat,\" she once said. \"I hate this modern-day political correctness, that you don't call things by their proper name.\" Her agent remembers Wright similarly in a statement: \"Loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, Clarissa was utterly non-PC and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost.\" There's no word on Wright's cause of death, but the Guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2870}

{"pred": "Seattle's new sugary drink tax, which was introduced in 2018, has had a significant impact on the city's economy and residents' purchasing habits. The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold, making it more expensive for consumers. The tax applies to soda, sports drinks, kombucha, and other sugary beverages that don't list milk as their first ingredient. The tax has led to a decrease in sales of these products, especially at Costco, which saw a 34% decline in sales of beverages affected by the tax. The tax also impacted local businesses, with some retailers experiencing higher prices and decreased sales. The tax has also generated legal challenges, including a lawsuit against the city to get the tax thrown out and a request for a restraining order to prevent the tax from being imposed. Despite these challenges, the tax has been successful in discouraging people from drinking soda, which has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. However, the tax has also raised concerns about its potential impact on local businesses and the effectiveness of the revenue generated. The tax is seen as a good way to encourage people to consume healthier options, but it may not necessarily lead to a reduction in overall calorie intake or improve overall health outcomes. The tax is also controversial, with some arguing that it discriminates against low-income families and unfairly targets certain types of beverages. Overall, the new sugary drink tax in Seattle highlights the complex relationship between taxation, consumer behavior, and public health, and the challenges faced by municipalities in implementing such policies.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

The Parker Solar Probe, named after Parker, will be launched in July 2018 and aim to study the sun's atmosphere, particularly the solar wind, and its impact on the Earth's magnetic field. The spacecraft will travel to within 4 million miles of the sun's surface, the closest point to the sun, during its seven-year mission. The Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from the intense heat and radiation of the sun. The spacecraft will also have a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to keep the science instruments at room temperature. The mission aims to trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona, understand the heating of the solar corona and the mechanisms that accelerate the solar wind, and study the solar wind's origins. The Parker Solar Probe will also investigate the origins of solar wind, including the mysterious heating of the sun's atmosphere and how the solar wind accelerates to supersonic speeds of up to 400 miles per second. The mission will provide unprecedented insights into the physics of the sun, including the solar wind, and help scientists understand the mechanisms that drive it. The Parker Solar Probe will also study the solar wind's impact on the Earth's magnetic field, which is essential for maintaining the stability of the global power grid. The mission will also examine the impact of space weather on the power grid, including the possibility of long-term power outages and the potential for geomagnetic storms to cause widespread disruptions. The Parker Solar Probe will be the first spacecraft to study the sun's corona and solar wind, and its findings will have a profound impact on our understanding of the sun and its interactions with the space environment.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

This allowed the attackers to steal credit and debit card data without the need for physical access to the stores. The malware was able to bypass Target's security measures, such as encryption, and was able to steal sensitive information such as credit card numbers, encrypted PINs, and other personal data. The attack was carried out by criminal groups in Eastern Europe, using software coding proficiency to create the malware and hide their tracks. The report from iSight, a computer firm hired to investigate the breach, revealed that the malware was effective and could potentially be used for further attacks.

The new planet, estimated to be between five and ten times the mass of Earth, orbits beyond Neptune's path and has not been directly observed. The researchers behind the discovery, Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have used mathematical and computer modeling to establish its existence based on the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. They predict that Planet Nine could have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational forces of Jupiter or Saturn, and its presence challenges the traditional definition of a planet as a celestial body that has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked debates about Pluto's status, with some arguing for its reinstatement as a planet and others advocating for its demotion. However, Prof. Mike Brown, the \"Pluto killer,\" maintains that the IAU should not classify Pluto as a planet due to its misclassification in 2006. He believes that Pluto's demotion is necessary for the good of science, as it allows for the consideration of the candidacies of hundreds, possibly thousands of wannabe planets. Prof. Brown's views on Pluto's demotion have been widely shared on social media, with many scientists expressing support for the decision.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Pluto's demotion, the discovery of Planet Nine has reignited interest in the outer solar system and has provided valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system. The discovery has also highlighted the importance of studying small, icy objects in the outer solar system, as they play a crucial role in shaping the orbits of other planets and determining the structure of the solar system.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of Planet Nine represents a significant milestone in our understanding of the solar system, challenging the traditional definition of a planet and opening up new avenues for exploration and discovery.

SPECIAL MESSAGE,\" which outlined the storm's devastating impact on the region, including widespread roof and wall failure, loss of native trees, and severe water shortages. The bulletin warned that most of the area would be uninhabitable for weeks or even longer, with half of well-built homes likely to suffer significant damage.\n\nRicks' statement was widely disseminated through various media outlets, including NBC News headquarters in New York and across the United States, and received significant attention due to its vivid imagery and emotional impact. The statement was followed by a second, less widely circulated official forecast, the Area Forecast Discussion, which emphasized the need for immediate evacuation and highlighted the potential long-term consequences of the storm.\n\nDespite the warnings, some individuals within the National Weather Service initially hesitated to issue the emergency message, citing concerns about the accuracy of the predictions and the potential for overhyping the storm. However, Ricks' commitment to providing accurate information and his belief in the importance of communicating the urgency of the situation ultimately led him to take action.\n\nThe aftermath of the storm revealed the devastating impact of the hurricane on the Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood of New Orleans, where Ricks grew up. Many residents lost their homes and struggled to rebuild, while others experienced significant trauma and emotional distress. Despite the challenges, Ricks returned to work alongside colleagues who had no homes and were wearing the clothes they wore that day, reflecting the resilience and determination of the community in the face of adversity.\n\nIn conclusion, the National Weather Service's decision to issue the \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE\" on August 28, 2005, played a crucial role in conveying the urgency and severity of Hurricane Katrina's impact on the affected region. While some within the organization initially hesitated to act, Ricks' commitment to providing accurate information and his belief in the importance of communicating the crisis helped to mobilize the public and ensure that residents were aware of the impending disaster.

The study estimates that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50.

The movie's depiction of the police officers' actions and the aftermath of the tragedy is both accurate and graphic, leaving audiences with a sense of unease and anger.

The board members did not include Musk, his brother Kimbal Musk, or venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, who had previously expressed concerns about the timing and details of the proposal. The board statement also mentioned that the board had \"openly discussed\" the possibility of a private sale, but did not specify the timeline or the amount of funding required for the transaction. The board statement also raised questions about the timing and transparency of the announcement, with some members suggesting that the announcement was irregular and that Musk had other motives for disclosing the potential de-listing. The board statement also noted that Tesla shares had reached a peak of $368 after Musk's tweets on Tuesday, before trading on the stock market was halted.

To capture stars from other galaxies, scientists propose using a swarm of satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" which would create a spherical shell around a star and harness the power of its energy.

The show's format was unique, featuring a mix of news satire, humor, and interviews with prominent guests, often focusing on current events and social issues.\n\nDuring the Kilborn era, The Daily Show was known for its sharp wit and irreverent approach to political news, often poking fun at the conventions and practices of mainstream news outlets. However, Stewart's tenure as host was marked by controversy, with some writers and correspondents expressing concerns about the show's lack of a clear point of view and its tendency to mock political figures without regard for their actual policies or actions.\n\nIn 1999, Stewart was appointed as the new host of The Daily Show, and he quickly established himself as a formidable force in the comedy world. He introduced a new style of humor that emphasized sarcasm, irony, and a focus on the absurdity of political situations, often using personal anecdotes and observations to drive home the point. Stewart's approach to the show was characterized by a willingness to challenge established norms and push boundaries, leading to clashes with some of the remaining Kilborn writers and correspondents.\n\nOne significant development in the early years of The Daily Show was the hiring of David Jones, a 27-year-old writer and composer who had previously worked on The Onion, a satirical news website. Jones joined the show as a writer and contributed to several episodes, including a field piece about a homeless man named Dana Plato, which was later revealed to be a thinly veiled reference to the fictional character of Dana Plato from the film \"Our Dumb Century.\"\n\nAs the show continued to evolve, Stewart and his team faced challenges, including a backlash from some of the original writers and correspondents who felt that the show was too confrontational and lacked a cohesive narrative structure. This led to a period of tension and conflict, culminating in a \"fuck-you meeting\" that was leaked to the New York Post's \"Page Six\" in 2000.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Stewart remained committed to the show's mission to provide a fresh perspective on political news and engage audiences in a humorous and thought-provoking manner.

{"pred": "The discovery of ancient Middle Stone Age tools in Kenya, dating back to around 320,000 years ago, provides new insights into the evolution of early human societies in Africa. The oldest tools, consisting mainly of hand axes, were shaped like tear drops and had a rounded end and a pointed eye. The edges were wavy and sharp, indicating their effectiveness for chopping down branches or processing meat. The researchers also found evidence of pigment lumps, including two pieces with grinding marks, that were likely attached to handles, suggesting the use of tools for social status or communication.\n\nThe Middle Stone Age tools were produced from obsidian, a volcanic glass that originated from faraway locations, raising the possibility of long-distance contact and trading among hominid populations. The team found that the Middle Stone Age tools were not crude, early versions of the technology, but rather the full-blown Middle Stone Age, characterized by small, standardized stone tools that were prepared and retouched for specific purposes. The tools were made from obsidian, which was transported from 15 to 30 miles away, and some were made from obsidian that originated even further afield.\n\nThe Middle Stone Age tools were not limited to the handaxes, as the team also found evidence of the extraction of pigments, including bright red and black rocks that were then drilled into, possibly to extract pigment. This is the earliest evidence of the extraction of pigments, suggesting a complex culture where the ancient humans probably used pigments symbolically, perhaps to paint themselves, their hides, or weapons. Different groups exchanged raw materials (and possibly food) and possibly used pigments to communicate and build relationships.\n\nThe Middle Stone Age was marked by a long and tumultuous phase in the region, characterized by repeated cycles of droughts and high rainfall. This environmental change likely drove the need for adaptation or extinction of early human populations. The team's findings suggest that some hominin groups, such as the Hadza people of northern Tanzania, deliberately maintained distant contacts with other groups, using strategies to maintain these contacts, such as encouraging their children to marry into these other groups or taking trips to visit the groups, to maintain ties by giving gifts.\n\nThe Middle Stone Age was preceded by a long and complex history of environmental and climatic change, which likely influenced the development of technological change and the emergence of complex behaviors. The transition between the African Early and Middle Stone Age occurred around the time that our own species, Homo sapiens, was evolving across the continent, suggesting that the \"human", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The airline is also launching push notifications for passengers who have the airline's mobile app, which will inform them when boarding has started and give them a tool to manage their boarding group.

The Russian Embassy in Ottawa criticized the Canadian government for failing to hold Katriuk accountable for his actions, despite multiple appeals by Canadian Jewish organizations and efforts by the Russian authorities to ensure justice. Katriuk was found guilty of genocide in 2005 by an Italian military court and sentenced to life in prison in absentia. However, he was never extradited because he would have had to consent to it under German law. In 2007, the Harper cabinet decided not to revoke his citizenship, citing a lack of evidence. Katriuk's death has prompted the Canadian Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs to launch a criminal case against him, arguing that he was a key participant in a wartime massacre of civilians in Italy. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, a law enforcement body that reports only to President Vladimir Putin, called on Canada to deliver Katriuk to Moscow so he could be tried for alleged war crimes. The Harper government responded by ignoring the request and saying it will never recognize Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress, a lobby group with significant influence in the Prime Minister's Office, has urged Ottawa to ignore Russia's demands, stating that the Federal Court of Canada in 1999 found no evidence that Katriuk participated in war crimes or atrocities against the civilian population during the Second World War.

Over the course of 33 years, Cruz grew into a beloved student and teacher at Brown Elementary School, where he became a legendary figure known for his disruptive behavior. However, his behavior eventually led to a confrontation with his stepfather, who kicked him out of the home. Cruz's mother packed everything he owned in a cardboard box and took him to hide at a nearby truck stop, where he was discovered by Hooper and her husband, Gale, who took him in and provided him with a safe haven. Cruz's mother asked Hooper to keep him for the weekend, and he stayed with the family until he turned 16, when he legally changed his name to his new family's. Since then, Cruz has gone on to excel academically and has become a successful employee at a payroll company. He has also adopted his stepfather's surname, Riojas, and has a strong connection to his birth family.

The MCA, a federal law passed in 2006, has reversed the right to habeas corpus for anyone detained at Guantánamo Bay and for any foreigner the government detains anywhere and labels an \"enemy combatant.\" The MCA applies to legal residents of the US, including those who have lived in the US for years, potentially leading to the labeling of an individual as an \"enemy combatant\" and imprisonment without legal recourse. The habeas corpus petition has been a significant issue in the fight for the release of chimpanzees, Hercules, and Leo, who have been held at Stony Brook University in New York for over six years. The court hearing has been moved back from 6 May to 27 May, where the judge will hear legal arguments regarding whether Hercules and Leo should remain at Stony Brook.

The Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals, making it illegal to import illegally harvested wood. However, Gibson has maintained that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law. The company has denied the allegations of trafficking, stating that all of its imports from Madagascar have been legal. The Justice Department has stated that Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband, and it quotes emails that seem to show the company taking steps to maintain a supply chain that's been connected to illegal timber harvests. The company has presented documents to support its claim, and the recent raid seized legally obtained wood from India. The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, has expressed concern over the potential impact of the charges on the company's business and the吉他 industry as a whole. The Justice Department has defended the Lacey Act and its efforts to enforce it, stating that it aims to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that buyers must be asking questions and sourcing wood responsibly.

The ocean, which is composed of water with a higher proportion of deuterium compared to Earth's ocean, was discovered through a series of measurements of sunlight reflected off the Martian surface and through the atmosphere. The team of scientists led by Geronimo Villanueva, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, calculated the amount of water that would have been present during the ancient era, and it was found to have been enough to cover the entire planet evenly, reaching a depth of about 450 feet (137 meters). The excess deuterium in the water suggests that Mars lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that currently locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The study provides new insights into the history of Mars and the potential for life to have originated or flourished on the planet. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the planet's water content and suggest that Mars may have been much wetter in the past than previously thought.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer model that uses functional MRI to reconstruct YouTube videos from viewers' brain activity. The model matches the features of the videos, such as colors, shapes, and movements, with patterns of brain activity, resulting in a blurry, dreamlike version of the video as seen by the mind's eye. This technology has the potential to revolutionize fields such as entertainment, advertising, and medical diagnosis, as it allows for the visualization of internal imagery without the need for visual stimulation.\n\nThe study involved participants who watched YouTube videos for several hours at a time while lying still inside an MRI machine. The researchers then used the brain imaging data to create a computer model that matched the features of the videos with patterns of brain activity. By running the model backward through the data, the researchers were able to uncover what the viewer saw during the video, including subtle changes in blood flow to visual areas of the brain, which predicted what was on the screen at the time.\n\nThe reconstructed videos are blurry because they layer all the YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity pattern. However, the researchers believe that the technology could one day be used to broadcast imagery, such as the scenes that play out inside our minds independent from vision. They argue that if the technology could be used to decode movies people saw, it might be possible to decode things in the brain that are movie-like but have no real-world analogs, like dreams or intentions.\n\nWhile the technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries, it raises ethical concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of personal information. The researchers acknowledge that the technology could potentially be used in detective work or court cases, but they caution that the accuracy of an accurate readout of a faulty memory only provides misleading information. Additionally, the nature of memories and their ability to be influenced by external factors make it challenging to use the technology in a court of law.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the remarkable capabilities of the human brain to process and visualize visual information, and the potential applications of this technology in various fields.

Egeland, who was convicted of mortgage fraud in 2014, had his sentence extended by three years and 10 months, bringing his total prison term to ten years. The extension was based on Egeland's guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the elaborate insurance scam, and for interstate failure to pay child support. Egeland had arranged for his 17-year-old son, Rylan Egeland, to shoot him in the leg with a shotgun on July 31, 2014, hoping to delay his prison sentence and benefit from a fraudulent disability insurance policy he had applied for seven days earlier. However, the son accidentally shot Egeland in his lower legs and left the scene. Egeland called 911 and claimed he was a victim of assault when he stopped to help a pregnant motorist. He told authorities he was suddenly hit in the head and shot along the side of the road. Egeland previously had pleaded guilty to fraud charges for his role in the Desert Sun housing scandal that rocked Central Oregon in 2009. Egeland was a co-owner of Desert Sun, which raised millions from local banks through a series of phony business plans and falsified loan applications.

The incident occurred one week before the shooting he had taken out a disability insurance policy, falsely claiming he had not been arrested in the past decade. The fraud was quickly detected, resulting in Egeland's left leg being amputated. Despite the injury, Egeland expressed remorse for his actions and stated that he regrets what he did.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is still investigating the accident, which took place on March 23 and resulted in the death of the driver, Walter Huang, who worked as an engineer at Apple. According to Tesla, the reason for the severity of the accident was due to the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier that was not replaced after a previous accident. The NTSB stated that the barrier was crushed in a prior accident without being replaced, and that this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash was unprecedented. Huang's brother, Will, told San Francisco ABC station KGO that Walter had complained \"seven to 10 times the car would swivel toward that same exact barrier during auto-pilot.\" The California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) is responsible for maintaining the barriers, and they released a statement stating that replacement work was scheduled once the maintenance team had been notified.

The FBI's chief security officer, Bob Lord, stated that the attack serves as further evidence of the increasing threat posed by cyberattacks and the need for increased vigilance in preventing future attacks. The attack involved the creation of a fake login page through a cloud service provider and a security research firm, which was designed to gather usernames and passwords that would allow access to the party's database. The DNC and the two companies involved in detecting the operation believe they have thwarted the potential attack, but the full extent of the attack remains unknown. The FBI is urging all political groups and government organizations to remain vigilant in protecting their voter databases and implementing robust cybersecurity measures to prevent similar attacks in the future.

The latest report by the University of Washington-Seattle's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation provides a comprehensive overview of one of the pressing public health dilemmas of our time, using data covering 188 nations from 1980 to 2013. The report shows that obesity rates are rising in all parts of the world, with the highest rates occurring in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands. The biggest obesity rises among women came in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain, while men were found to be more affected in New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. The richest country, the United States, had the largest chunk of the planet's obese population, accounting for 13% of its population despite claiming less than 5% of its people. Obesity is a complex problem fueled by the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles. It is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, leading to chronic complications that kill about 3.4 million adults annually. The problem is most acute in the Middle East and North Africa, with more than 58% of adult men and 65% of adult women overweight or obese. Obesity is appearing at increasing young ages, rising nearly 50 percent in children and adolescents worldwide. The report suggests that obesity is not a cosmetic issue, but rather a main risk factor for morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries. The report highlights the need for a multi-faceted approach to addressing the obesity crisis, including improving access to healthy foods, promoting physical activity, and reducing sedentary lifestyles. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and suggest solutions, with a report expected in early 2015.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

The letter suggests that Cruise may have taken the unusual step of writing to his ex to rekindle their friendship, despite the fact that they were previously married for 12 years. The insider who provided the information claims that Cruise wrote the letter because he knows that Holmes would be unresponsive over the phone, and that he hopes she is doing well.

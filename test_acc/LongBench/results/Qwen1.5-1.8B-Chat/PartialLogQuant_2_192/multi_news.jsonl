Kalashnikov was born in 1919 and grew up during the Soviet era, where the Red Army's lack of weapons led him to design and develop the AK-47. The rifle became a symbol of resistance against the Soviet government and played a significant role in the arms race between countries like the United States and China.\n\nIn 1996, Kalashnikov donated his archive of crawl data to the Internet Archive, which adds it to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. This donation highlights the importance of preserving historical records and the impact of technology on the development of military weaponry.\n\nIn 2012, Kalashnikov wrote a long emotional letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, expressing his fear of moral responsibility for the deaths of thousands of people caused by the AK-47. The letter suggests that Kalashnikov believed he was morally accountable for the deaths, despite not accepting full responsibility for them. The letter also touches on the psychological toll of living with the guilt of the loss of innocent lives.\n\nThe article mentions that Kalashnikov's personal papers, including a handwritten note from 1995, reveal a deep sense of spiritual pain and a desire to find answers to the question of whether the AK-47 was solely responsible for the deaths of the victims. The letter was published in Izvestia, a pro-Russian newspaper, and was signed by Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, who attributes the priestly assistance to a priest who visited the family home.\n\nThe article also notes that Kalashnikov's death marked the end of a chapter in his life, as he had previously refused to take responsibility for the deaths of millions of people. The AK-47 continues to be a symbol of resistance and a tool of armed conflict, with Kalashnikov's legacy serving as a reminder of the need for accountability and the devastating consequences of war.

The cloth, which is 14 feet long, 3.5 feet wide, and kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case, has been scrutinized for years due to radiocarbon dating, which determined its origin to be between 1260 and 1390 CE. The researchers used a living subject and a mannequin to analyze the flow of blood on the cloth, comparing it to the images of Jesus Christ. The bloodstain pattern analysis showed that the bloodstains on the cloth are inconsistent with each other, indicating that it may not be a genuine crucifixion depiction. The researchers concluded that the cloth is a medieval forgery and that the bloodstains on it are not consistent with any known method of creating a crucifixion image. The researchers also tested the bloodstains on the cloth with real and synthetic blood samples, finding that the former is inconsistent with the latter. The study suggests that the cloth may have been created through a process involving human blood, rather than a crucified person or a face-down corpse.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The first article discusses the excavation of a Bronze Age skeleton at a dig in Wiltshire, while the second article highlights the discovery of a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age artifact at a dig in the Vale of Pewsey, near Stonehenge. Both discoveries involve the excavation of a large-scale site, including the construction of ramparts, a large circular enclosure, and a series of smaller monuments. The excavation team from the University of Reading, led by Dr. Jim Leary, has made significant progress in uncovering the remains of a 4,000-year-old child's skeleton, which was found in a foetal position and adorned with an amber necklace. The discovery provides insights into the gender of the child, its diet, and the location of the burial site. The excavation team plans to analyze the skeletal remains to determine the age of the child, its diet, and the pathologies associated with the burial. The findings from the first five weeks of the dig have been exciting, but the best discoveries have emerged during the last six weeks, revealing the full extent of the site's history. The excavation team has focused on the Marden henge and Wiltshire henge, both of which have been excavated and studied for centuries due to their exceptional preservation. The aim of the digs is to gain a deeper understanding of the people who lived in the area surrounding Stonehenge, providing insights into the gender of the child, its diet, and the location of the burial site. The findings from the first five weeks of the dig have been particularly intriguing, highlighting the importance of the site in understanding the story of the region and the role it played in the development of the Bronze Age civilization.

A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge.

Instead, they relied solely on Mr. Wilson's smartphone to find a suitable route down. The couple's phone provided directions, but they ultimately fell 20-30 feet down a vertical cliff, resulting in a fatal injury.

The third article provides more details about the circumstances surrounding the accident, including the fact that the route changed after the couple attempted to traverse the west face to avoid the summit, and that the couple may have seen a footpath and joined it together. The coroner concluded that the falls occurred as a result of a change in route and recommended that anyone planning to climb the north ridge avoid retracing their steps or descending the same route.

{"pred": "Seattle's new $1.75-cent-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages has sparked controversy and backlash from businesses and residents alike. The tax, which applies to beverages that list milk as their primary ingredient, has led to a dramatic increase in prices at major retailers like Costco, causing a 34% decrease in sales of Gatorade and a 47% decline in sales of sweetened beverages in the city's supermarkets. The tax has also targeted healthy foods, such as those sold at Starbucks, and has resulted in a shift towards alternative sources of income for businesses, including the rise of retailers' outlets outside the city limits. The Seattle City Council is currently exploring ways to address the negative impacts of the tax, such as providing incentives for local businesses to sell healthier options and addressing concerns about the tax targeting healthy foods. The tax has also sparked legal battles, with the beverage industry and the state's Can the Tax Coalition challenging the implementation and arguing that the tax is regressive and distorts the perception of health. The tax has also had a significant impact on local businesses, with some experiencing reduced sales and revenue, and others struggling to compete with neighboring communities. The tax has also raised questions about the effectiveness of the measure in reducing obesity rates and promoting healthier choices.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The study involved monitoring the weight and body weight of 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over a median of five years. The study adjusted for various risk factors, including age, cholesterol levels, and previous heart conditions, and found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death. The study also found that individuals with chronic weight fluctuations, such as those who have experienced weight losses and gains of up to 3.9 kg (8.6 lbs) over a 4.7-year period, had a 116% higher risk of heart attacks, 124% higher risk of stroke, and 136% higher risk of death compared to those with minimal weight fluctuations. The study highlights the potential negative effects of yo-yo dieting on cardiovascular health, particularly for individuals with pre-existing CAD. The researchers suggest that weight fluctuations may contribute to the severity of heart disease outcomes, highlighting the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding weight fluctuations. The study emphasizes the need for further investigation into the relationship between yo-yo dieting and the increased risk of heart attacks, stroke, and death in individuals with CAD. The study's findings raise concerns about the long-term health implications of yo-yo dieting and underscore the need for targeted interventions to prevent and manage CAD.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another. And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

{"pred": "The article discusses three different ways in which advanced civilizations can potentially dominate the universe: through the extraction of all of their star's energy, through the construction of a solid shell around a star, and through the capture and harnessed energy of other galaxies. The author, astrophysicist and writer of the paper, Kardashev, first proposed the three stages of technological advancement, known as the Three Types of Technological Civilization, in 1962, based on his understanding of the effects of expanding space on the universe. He believed that the presence of dark energy, a mysterious force that is causing space to expand, would make it necessary for civilizations to expand and capture energy from other galaxies to ensure their survival.\n\nIn the new paper published on June 13th, Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, revisits Kardashev's model and adds a new, apocalyptic twist. The author argues that the presence of the stars beyond our own Milky Way is causing the universe to expand, making it impossible for humans to access the energy needed to power advanced civilizations. Therefore, the solution to this problem lies in capturing and extracting energy from stars, specifically from the stars of other galaxies, before they become completely inaccessible due to the inevitable expansion of the universe.\n\nThe paper proposes several methods for capturing and harnessed energy from stars, including using satellites to gather energy from distant stars and using them to propel the entire ball of energy back to the planet that wants to use it. The paper suggests that advanced civilizations would understand the inevitability of the universe's expansion and would expand throughout the universe, focusing on the largest and most powerful stars. The authors propose that such civilizations would create a spherical shell around a star, allowing them to capture its energy and use it to accelerate the star back to the planet that wants to use it. The paper also mentions that such a civilization would likely have already reached the level of advanced civilizations, with a possibility of having thousands or even millions of years' worth of technology.\n\nThe article highlights the importance of advanced civilizations in understanding the implications of the universe's expansion and the potential for them to harness energy from other galaxies. The author notes that the existence of the three types of technologically advanced civilizations, each with their own unique approach to capturing and utilizing energy, could lead to the discovery of alien civilizations that are thousands or even millions of years older than humanity.\n\nThe article emphasizes the need for scientists to develop tools and technologies to detect the presence of these advanced", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

However, Santorum's comments were met with skepticism by some Republicans, including Santorum himself.\nRomney's campaign responded to Santorum's claim, stating that he did not believe that Santorum was referring to the size of his campaign or the number of people who attended his rallies. Instead, Santorum argued that he was referring to his commitment to being a serious conservative and defending himself against criticism. However, Santorum's comments sparked controversy within the Republican Party, with some arguing that he was attempting to mislead the public into thinking that he was a strong conservative.\nOn the other hand, New York Times White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough defended President Obama's position on birth control and Catholic institutions during an interview on CNN's State of the Union program. McDonough stated that the administration's stance on birth control and Catholic organizations has been consistent, and that the administration's recent accommodation with the Catholic Church, which includes allowing insurance companies to cover contraception costs through religious organizations, is a step towards winning over the bishops.\nLew, the former White House budget director, also weighed in on the issue, expressing surprise that insurance companies would be willing to pay for contraception coverage through religious organizations. However, he acknowledged that the policy may result in lower premiums for insurance companies, potentially reducing the cost of birth control for consumers.\nOverall, the debate surrounding Santorum's comment about his status as a conservative and his attempt to deceive the public highlights the ongoing tensions between the Republican Party and the Catholic Church regarding reproductive rights and the role of religion in American society.

{"pred": "The Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya contains evidence of a long period of climate change that drove the development of advanced technologies and practices among early humans. The Olorgesailie Basin was home to a series of stone tools, including hand axes, which were shaped like tears or teardrops, with rounded ends and a pointed end. The researchers believe that these tools were used for both foraging for food and cutting off the carcass of large animals, possibly as spears or spearheads. The team also found evidence of pigment, including two pieces with grinding marks, that were likely attached to handles, providing insights into the use of pigments for social identification and status. The team's findings suggest that the technology and practices of early humans in the Olorgesailie Basin were not limited to hunting and gathering, but also included cooperation and trade with other groups. The Olorgesailie Basin represents the first evidence of the Middle Stone Age in Africa, which marked the beginning of the development of complex societies and the emergence of modern human behaviors. The Olorgesailie Basin's location in the middle of a vast, arid grassland with significant environmental changes during the Middle Stone Age provided a context for the development of complex networks of social interactions and knowledge transfer. The Olorgesailie Basin's Acheulian culture, characterized by the use of obsidian, was transported from faraway locations, while the Middle Stone Age technology, including the use of obsidian, was already present in the Olorgesailie Basin. The Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age tools and pigment samples provide evidence of a long history of social networks and the exchange of resources, including raw materials, between different groups of people, including those living in the Olorgesailie Basin. The Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age tools and pigment samples indicate the emergence of complex social structures and the development of advanced thinking and planning, which allowed for the emergence of modern human behaviors in the region. The Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age tools and pigment samples provide evidence of the long-term stability of the technology and its widespread application, suggesting the development of a more sophisticated and adaptable human species. The Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age technology and practices represent a departure from the traditional, primitive stone tools and pigmented materials of the earlier Olorgesailie sites, indicating a shift towards more advanced technologies and practices.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

The procedure was also seen as a potential solution to the challenges faced by children with microtia, such as bullying and low self-esteem. Researchers at the Institute of Child Health, led by the Great Ormond Street Hospital, are working on developing a way to grow human ear tissues from a patient's own fat tissue using stem cell technology.

{"pred": "In a recent case in northwest China's Gansu province, a Chinese man named Guan Quanzhi received a settlement of over $80,000 in compensation after his right leg was bitten by a wild panda while working on his farmland. The incident occurred in March 2014 when the panda wandered onto Guan Quanzhi's land, where local officials tried to capture it. The animal bit Guan in the leg, causing him to undergo eight hours of surgery. Guan sued the local forestry officials and the nearby Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, claiming that they were responsible for the injury. After negotiations, the forest department and the local government agreed to compensate Guan with 520,000 yuan, according to his lawyer Wang Chaohui. Guan is satisfied with the amount, which will cover his medical expenses, and he may need further operations. The incident highlights the increasing threat of wildlife attacks on humans, particularly pandas, and the importance of protecting these endangered species through proper regulation and conservation efforts. Despite the compensation, the situation remains complex due to the high reproductive rate of pandas and the pressure they face from habitat loss, climate change, and human encroachment. The Chinese government has acknowledged the role of conservationists in reducing the risk of panda attacks and has credited the increase in the number of pandas to increased protection efforts. However, the organization warns that although pandas are often depicted as gentle creatures, they can pose a significant danger to humans, including attacks on livestock and individuals. The incident serves as a reminder of the need for effective wildlife management strategies and public awareness campaigns to prevent future incidents like this one.", "answers": ["Pandas may prefer their meals in the form of bamboo, but that doesn't mean their bite is toothless.

The ratings for the show's premiere on Monday night, featuring Schwarzenegger as the new host, were approximately 4.9 million, significantly lower than the 6.6 million average viewership of ABC and CBS' flagship program, \"The Bachelor.\" This decline was attributed to the lack of promotion and anticipation surrounding Schwarzenegger's hosting debut, which was overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the upcoming Trump presidency and the potential conflict with the show's previous host, Donald Trump.\n\nIn contrast, NBC's \"Celebrity Apprentice\" received mixed reviews, with Schwarzenegger's hosting debut failing to impress the audience.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people. That list was the basis for a story in the North Coast Journal about the high number of missing people in Humboldt County. The newspaper shared the story Thursday on Facebook and asked readers if they recognized any of the missing people. Amy O'Brien did. \"I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar,\" O'Brien tells the Chronicle. \"I instantly thought of The Bachelor.\" The Journal informed the sheriff's office, which contacted Martinez and removed her from the list. \"MOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don’t get cell service on The Bachelor??,\" Martinez tweeted after learning she was a missing person.

The study analyzed data from the Danish National Birth Cohort Study, which tracked the health of over 64,000 children born between 1996 and 2002. The researchers found that women who took acetaminophen more frequently during pregnancy were more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD or a rare condition called hyperkinetic disorder (HKD). The study authors believe that the risk of these conditions is not solely due to the drug itself, but rather to underlying infections or other factors that the women may have experienced during pregnancy. The study authors caution against taking acetaminophen more frequently than necessary and advise pregnant women to avoid taking it unless it is absolutely necessary. The study found that women who reported taking acetaminophen more than once per week had a 29% higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD, and a 37% higher risk of a less common diagnosis called hyperkinetic disorder. The study authors suggest that the risk of these conditions is not clear, and more research is needed to fully understand the potential impact of acetaminophen on fetal development.

The film features a mix of themes of hope, grief, and the supernatural, with a focus on the protagonist's journey to uncover the truth behind her death and the eventual resolution of the case. The film stars Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg, and Rachel Weisz, with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens writing the screenplay. The movie was directed by Peter Jackson, who previously directed the critically acclaimed \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. However, the film's tone shifts from lighthearted to dark and somber, with the use of CGI and computer-generated imagery to create a surreal and fantastical world between heaven and earth. The film explores themes of grief, loss, and the possibility of a loving afterlife, while also highlighting the complexities of the human experience. Despite its flaws, the film's best moments include Ronan's portrayal of a grieving father and the relationship between his daughter and her mother, as well as the performances of the supporting cast.

The House of Representatives has proposed a plan to delay the health law by one year and repeal the law's tax on medical devices, while the Senate is considering a bill that would maintain the ACA and possibly remove the tax. The Senate is divided over the healthcare law, with some Democrats wanting to eliminate it entirely and others supporting a compromise. The House is expected to approve a spending bill that includes the health law's conditions, but the Senate is likely to reject it, leaving the government in a difficult position. The potential shutdown could have significant consequences for the economy, including job losses, reduced access to federal services, and a potential impact on tourism and the federal budget. The White House and the House leadership are urging the Senate to pass a short-term funding bill to prevent a default on the debt ceiling, but the Senate is unlikely to do so. The potential shutdown could cause widespread economic disruption, particularly in the Washington region, where the federal government accounts for one-third of the economy. The House Speaker, John Boehner, has expressed a willingness to delay the health law or even consider a different approach to the issue, but the Senate is expected to vote down any proposals that involve the health law.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

This incident has led to a temporary shutdown of the station's external cooling loops, which are responsible for maintaining the station's temperature and preventing ice formation. The issue was identified as a \"Big 14\" maintenance issue, which typically requires a spacewalk to address the problem. However, due to the nature of the issue, the crew was not in immediate danger, and the situation does not warrant a full-scale spacewalk. Instead, NASA has scaled down operations on the station, reducing the number of critical tasks that need to be completed.

The team is exploring various options, including a software fix or a spacewalk, depending on the availability of resources and the urgency of the issue. The space station's life support systems are functioning normally, and the crew is focused on ensuring the safety of the crew and the environment while addressing the issue.

Hamm was surveying a section of Australia's Flinders Ranges when his partner, aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard, had to go to the bathroom. \"Nature called and Cliff walked up this creek bed into this gorge and found this amazing spring surrounded by rock art,\" Hamm says. At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

The author, astrophysicist and writer of the paper, Kardashev, first proposed the three stages of technological advancement, known as the Three Types of Technological Civilization, in 1962, based on his understanding of the effects of expanding space on the universe. He believed that the presence of dark energy, a mysterious force that is causing space to expand, would make it necessary for civilizations to expand and capture energy from other galaxies to ensure their survival.\n\nIn the new paper published on June 13th, Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, revisits Kardashev's model and adds a new, apocalyptic twist. The author argues that the presence of the stars beyond our own Milky Way is causing the universe to expand, making it impossible for humans to access the energy needed to power advanced civilizations. Therefore, the solution to this problem lies in capturing and extracting energy from stars, specifically from the stars of other galaxies, before they become completely inaccessible due to the inevitable expansion of the universe.\n\nThe paper proposes several methods for capturing and harnessed energy from stars, including using satellites to gather energy from distant stars and using them to propel the entire ball of energy back to the planet that wants to use it. The paper suggests that advanced civilizations would understand the inevitability of the universe's expansion and would expand throughout the universe, focusing on the largest and most powerful stars. The authors propose that such civilizations would create a spherical shell around a star, allowing them to capture its energy and use it to accelerate the star back to the planet that wants to use it. The paper also mentions that such a civilization would likely have already reached the level of advanced civilizations, with a possibility of having thousands or even millions of years' worth of technology.\n\nThe article highlights the importance of advanced civilizations in understanding the implications of the universe's expansion and the potential for them to harness energy from other galaxies. The author notes that the existence of the three types of technologically advanced civilizations, each with their own unique approach to capturing and utilizing energy, could lead to the discovery of alien civilizations that are thousands or even millions of years older than humanity.\n\nThe article emphasizes the need for scientists to develop tools and technologies to detect the presence of these advanced", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The procedure involved extracting a rib from Kieran's left and right sides, shaping the cartilage from the rib into a framework for the ears, and inserting the framework into Kieran's skull. The surgery was carried out under the guidance of consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, who harvested the rib cartilage from Kieran's ribs and used it to create a new ear framework. The ear framework was then inserted into Kieran's skull, and the skin was sculpted to fit the ear shape of his mother's ears. The procedure was considered a cosmetic operation, but it brought significant psychological benefits to Kieran, including increased confidence and improved social interactions. The procedure was also seen as a potential solution to the challenges faced by children with microtia, such as bullying and low self-esteem. Researchers at the Institute of Child Health, led by the Great Ormond Street Hospital, are working on developing a way to grow human ear tissues from a patient's own fat tissue using stem cell technology. The procedure involves harvesting stem cells from a patient's fat and inducing them to differentiate into cartilage or bone. The technique is expected to offer a safer alternative to harvesting human ear cartilage, making it less invasive for children. The procedure is currently being tested at the Institute of Child Health, and scientists believe it could potentially revolutionize the field of tissue engineering and provide a more personalized approach to treating children with microtia.

If Simpson is indeed released this fall—which appears almost certainly to be the decision—it will \"renew the rabid curiosity\" in the case and \"produce a spectacle unlike anything we’ve seen since he went behind bars,\" Nancy Armour at USA Today predicts. There has even been talk that Simpson might end up with a reality TV show, but Armour wants Simpson to avoid the spotlight unless he wants to return to the \"toxic mentality that landed him in prison in the first place.\" If the former NFL star does end up with a TV show, the money is likely to go to the families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, CBS News reports. He will still receive an NFL pension estimated at $25,000 per month."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3982}
{"pred": "Jamaica's Parliament has passed a bill decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, commonly known as ganja, and establishing a licensing agency to regulate the production, distribution, and use of medical marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The legislation, which was introduced in 2017, aims to eliminate the criminalization of small-scale marijuana possession and reduce the number of individuals convicted of possessing less than 2 oz of the drug. The new law allows for the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes, while also allowing tourists to purchase small amounts for personal consumption. The National Security Minister, Peter Bunting, stated that the legislation does not intend to soften Jamaica's stance on drug trafficking or the cultivation of illegal plots, but rather to ensure the enforcement of Jamaican law and uphold international treaty obligations. The legislation has been met with mixed reactions, with some arguing that it will lead to increased drug trafficking and others supporting the relaxation of the law. The Jamaican government has expressed optimism that the legislation will contribute to the growth of the country's medical marijuana industry and the development of innovative pot-derived products. The legislation will also provide a framework for the regulation of the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. Overall, the bill represents a major shift in Jamaica's approach to drug use and criminal justice, potentially opening up new opportunities for the country's economy and healthcare sectors.", "answers": ["Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself. Jamaica's parliament last night approved a law decriminalizing small amounts of pot, the AP reports. People found with 2 ounces or less of marijuana will now simply receive a ticket—not a crime on their record—and cultivation of five plants or fewer is now allowed. A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement. Jamaica also hopes to boost its health tourism and medical marijuana industries and make it a major player in the pot product market, the Guardian notes. International exporting, however, remains a no-no. A US counternarcotics official told the AP in an email that \"Jamaican law is of course Jamaica's own business,\" but warned that drug trafficking into the US is still illegal."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1853}

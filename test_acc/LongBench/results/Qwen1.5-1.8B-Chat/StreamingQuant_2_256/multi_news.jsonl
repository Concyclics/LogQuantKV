As a result, Kalashnikov became fascinated by the idea of creating a simple yet effective weapon that could defend his country against enemy forces.\n\nAfter years of research and experimentation, Kalashnikov began designing the AK-47 in 1946, which he initially submitted to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church for approval. The head of the church, Cyril Alexander Volkov, read the letter and expressed concern about the potential moral implications of the AK-47's use, stating that it was \"devastating\" for the victims and that the longer Kalashnikov lived, the more he pondered the question of whether he was accountable for the deaths of those who were killed.\n\nIn 2012, Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, revealed that a priest had assisted her father in composing the letter, which was published in Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin newspaper. The letter detailed Kalashnikov's thoughts on the morality of the AK-47's use, particularly in relation to the deaths of innocent civilians, whom he believed were unjustly targeted by the Russian government's policies.\n\nKalashnikov's letter to the Russian Orthodox Church patriarch, Patriarch Kirill, expressed deep spiritual pain and anxiety over the loss of lives. He argued that the AK-47 was a tool of defense for his country, not for terrorist activities like those carried out by child soldiers in Saudi Arabia.

The excavation team, led by Dr. Jim Leary, director of the summer excavation program at the Reading University, aims to gain insights into the child's gender, diet, and pathologies, as well as the location and age of the child's burial site. The discovery is significant because it provides a deeper understanding of the people who lived in the area surrounding Stonehenge, including the presence of a large, three-meter-high rampart enclosing a complex of smaller monuments, including the Hatfield Barrow, which was destroyed by a collapse in 1807.

{"pred": "Seattle's new $1.75-cent-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages has sparked controversy and debate among residents and businesses alike. The tax was introduced in 2017 to encourage healthier choices and reduce sugar intake, but it has led to a hike in prices and decreased sales at major retailers like Costco, causing frustration and calls for reform. The Seattle City Council ultimately approved the tax, but it has faced criticism from some who argue that it targets low-income communities and disproportionately affects healthy alternatives like fruit juices and smoothies. The tax also triggered legal battles and protests, with the beverage industry and other groups opposing it. The tax is expected to generate revenue for Seattle, but it is unclear whether it will lead to long-term improvements in health or exacerbate existing inequalities. The tax is seen as a tool for reducing sugar consumption and promoting healthier choices, but it is also criticized for targeting certain types of beverages and failing to address the root causes of obesity and diabetes. The tax is set to collect $15.99 per ounce, but the exact amount collected by Seattle is unknown. The tax applies to sweetened beverages that list milk as their primary ingredient, including many flavored coffee beverages. The tax has caused a significant increase in the cost of Gatorade, which now costs $26.33 compared to $16. The tax also affects other sugary drinks like Gatorade, which lists milk as its first ingredient. The tax is aimed at reducing sugar consumption and promoting healthier options, but it has faced resistance from businesses and community organizations, especially those that supported the tax. The Seattle City Council is considering alternative solutions, such as increasing funding for community programs and finding alternative sources of revenue. The tax has also raised concerns about the potential for unintended consequences, such as reduced sales and increased congestion in the community. Overall, the Seattle tax on sweetened beverages has sparked a debate and controversy, highlighting the need for more comprehensive policies that address the root causes of health problems and promote healthier choices.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The Senate has agreed to a bill that would provide funding for the ACA, but it includes a provision that would delay the law's implementation for a year. The Senate is expected to reconvene on Monday afternoon to consider the bill, but it is unclear if the government will be able to pass it. The potential government shutdown is expected to have a significant impact on the economy, with an estimated loss of $200 million per day in federal workers and contractors. The shutdown could also affect the tourism industry, which is a major source of revenue for the Washington region. The potential shutdown could also have a negative impact on the federal judiciary, which relies on federal funding for operations. The federal government has not yet provided a funding bill for the upcoming fiscal year, and the government shutdown is expected to begin on Monday night, with the possibility of a prolonged shutdown. The White House and Senate leaders are expected to push for a compromise to keep the government funded, but the prospects of a successful resolution remain uncertain. The potential shutdown could have a significant impact on the economy, with the loss of federal services and the potential disruption of the healthcare system. The potential shutdown could also have a ripple effect on the rest of the country, with the potential for a shutdown in the coming weeks. The government has already taken action to prevent a government shutdown, including delaying the implementation of the health law and a bill to repeal the health care law's provisions. The potential government shutdown is a reminder of the importance of maintaining a stable federal budget and avoiding unnecessary fiscal brinksmanship.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The Kenyan Wildlife Service said the lion was killed in a wildlife management area outside the park's southern section, which is not fenced, and that the lion was attempting to establish new territory. The situation highlights the difficulty of balancing the need for protection of lions with the need to conserve them, as their populations have declined dramatically due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflicts with livestock herders.

The incident has sparked outrage and calls for justice, with some residents calling for the rangers to use tranquilizers and others advocating for the relocation of the lion to a sanctuary. The Kenyan government is currently considering different options, including moving the lion to a park, capturing it, or killing it if it poses a significant threat to humans. The incident has highlighted the challenges faced by wildlife officials in managing large carnivores in densely populated areas, particularly in Kenya, where the park system is under pressure due to urbanization and development.

The study involved monitoring the weight and body weight of 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over a median of five years, and adjusted for various risk factors. The study found that individuals with the highest weight variability had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death. The study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy weight but warns against excessive weight fluctuations, as they may lead to negative health outcomes. The study emphasizes the need for individuals with CAD to maintain a balanced weight cycle and consider adopting a healthier lifestyle to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The findings raise concerns about the long-term effects of yo-yo dieting on individuals with pre-existing CAD, highlighting the need for further investigation into the relationship between weight fluctuations and heart disease outcomes. The study concludes that while its methodology cannot definitively determine the cause-and-effect relationship between yo-yo dieting and CAD, it underscores the potential risks associated with weight fluctuations in this population.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another. And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

He believes that by doing so, he can ensure that the show's popularity remains at bay and prevent it from reaching a wider audience. To achieve this goal, Cartman embarks on a nationwide campaign to find the image of the Prophet Muhammad, hoping to capture it before Kyle can do so.\n\nThe two boys, Cartman and Kyle, set out on a thrilling adventure across the United States, engaging in a race against time to locate the image.

This development follows the country's recent nuclear test, which was widely condemned by the international community. The ICBM test is seen as a way for North Korea to celebrate its upcoming birthday, which falls on September 10. The ICBM test is likely to be launched in a southward direction, possibly targeting the Pacific Ocean, as seen in the South Korean National Intelligence Service's (NIS) briefing. The NIS stated that North Korea may test-launch an ICBM with a larger payload capacity than the six previous tests, including a nuclear weapon and an intermediate-range missile capable of reaching the United States. The ICBM test is seen as a significant milestone for North Korea, as it represents a direct challenge to the international community's efforts to prevent further nuclear proliferation. The North Korean government has previously demonstrated a strong commitment to nuclear testing, with previous tests falling on September 9, 2016, and an earlier ICBM test in 2015. The ICBM test is seen as a potential escalation in tensions between North Korea and the international community, particularly following the country's latest nuclear test. The ICBM test is expected to be launched at a high angle, potentially targeting the Pacific Ocean, as seen in the NIS briefing. The NIS stated that North Korea may also test-launch an ICBM with a smaller payload capacity than the previous tests, suggesting that the country is looking to maximize the impact of its nuclear capabilities. The ICBM test is seen as a significant threat to regional stability, as it could lead to increased military activity and potentially escalate tensions with other countries such as the United States.

The study analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute's National Cancer Registry from 1998 to 2011 and found that 37,847 out of 258,000 colorectal cancer patients were younger than 50, accounting for 15% of the total population. The study highlights the importance of early detection and screening for these patients, particularly those with advanced-stage disease, as they tend to have a higher likelihood of surviving without a cancer recurrence. The study also found that younger patients with regional or distant metastases were more likely to receive aggressive treatments, including surgery and radiation therapy, compared to older patients. The study emphasizes the need for improved risk assessment and screening practices for younger patients, especially those aged 50 and above, to catch the disease at an earlier stage, potentially reducing the number of cancer deaths. The study concludes that the current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening should be revised to consider the increasing number of younger patients, with a focus on early detection and aggressive treatment.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

The board members, including CEO Elon Musk, have met multiple times over the past week to discuss the potential benefits of a private company structure for Tesla's long-term growth and addressing the funding needed for the transaction. The board's statement includes discussions around the company's long-term interests, the valuation of the deal, and the possibility of the board being satisfied with the funding provided by Musk's tweet.

The author, astrophysicist and author of the paper, suggests that the three-step process is necessary to ensure that the universe remains stable and capable of providing energy to future civilizations. The author adds a new twist by proposing that the presence of dark energy in the universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate, making it impossible to extract energy from the universe indefinitely. The author argues that advanced civilizations would recognize the existence of such a scenario and would create a massive spherical shell around a star to capture its energy and harness it to accelerate the entire ball of fire back toward the planet that wants to use it. The article highlights the importance of capturing and harnessed energy from other galaxies, as well as the potential for advanced civilizations to reach and potentially interact with alien civilizations through the use of massive, spherical structures called \"Dyson spheres\" and \"statite\" satellites. The article also mentions the challenges of detecting such signals in the light signature from distant galaxies, and the possibility of advanced civilizations using massive, spherical structures to capture and store energy from stars.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "The Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya contains evidence of a significant shift in the development of early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. The Olorgesailie Basin was once a lush, grassland ecosystem, but over time, the landscape shifted to become a desert due to climate change. The Olorgesailie Basin is home to a variety of stone tools, including handaxes, which were shaped like tears and had a rounded end and a pointed end. The researchers believe that these tools were used for both cutting and hunting, and that the technology was well-established by 300,000 years ago. The Olorgesailie Basin also contains evidence of pigment, which was likely used to decorate objects or mark individuals' identities. The team's findings challenge previous assumptions about the emergence of modern human behaviors, such as language and symbolic thinking, and suggest that these behaviors emerged much earlier than previously thought. The Olorgesailie Basin is the first location to document the Middle Stone Age, which is characterized by the use of smaller, more specialized stone tools and the development of a complex network of social interactions between dispersed groups of early humans. The discovery of these stone tools and pigments provides insights into the development of complex societies and the exchange of resources between different groups, suggesting the emergence of social networks and the exchange of goods and ideas. The Olorgesailie Basin is the earliest example of a region where modern human behaviors such as language and symbolic thinking emerged, and the Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age technology is well-established and has been passed down for centuries. The Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age technology includes the use of obsidian, which is likely from 1.2 million to 499,000 years ago, while the Olorgesailie Basin's Acheulian culture was characterized by the production of stone tools, including hand axes, and the development of a complex network of social interactions. The Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age technology is well-established and suggests that early humans in the region developed these technologies and practices, which were influenced by the environment and the need to adapt to changing circumstances. The Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age technology is not a crude, early version of the Middle Stone Age, but rather a well-established technology that began in the region and spread throughout the Olorgesailie Basin.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The procedure involved removing the rib cartilage from both sides of Kieran's body and shaping it into a framework for his ears. The surgeon, Neil Bulstrode, extracted the necessary cartilage from the ribs and used it to create a new ear on both sides of Kieran's head. The ear was designed based on the shape of Kieran's mother's ears, and the surgeon carefully matched the ear shapes to the ear-shaped templates provided by Kieran's family. The surgery was carried out under the supervision of a specialist in plastic and reconstructive surgery, and the team successfully harvested the rib cartilage from Kieran's own ribs.

The procedure involves the insertion of the ear frameworks into pockets in the skin, followed by the application of suction to shape the skin on the new ear. The surgery is currently being researched and developed by experts at the Institute of Child Health, part of the University College London, who aim to create a human ear from stem cells sourced from a patient's fat tissue.

The president urged the US not to \"turn inward\" and to \"resist the urge to demonize those who are different.\" Trump is also upset with the Obama administration for allowing the UN to pass a resolution condemning Israeli settlements, as well as with Obama personally for saying in an interview he could have beaten Trump and won a third term. In addition, the White House is defending the Department of Energy for not complying with a request from Trump's transition team for the names of employees involved in climate policy, ABC News reports.

The incident occurred on March 1, 2014, when a group of villagers were attempting to capture the animal, leading to a chase and a bite on Guan's leg. The panda then fled, leaving Guan with severe injuries that required eight surgeries over the following year. The incident sparked a lawsuit against local officials and the nearby Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, which is home to more than 1,000 wild pandas. The villagers' lawyer, Wang Chaohui, claimed that the compensation would cover the cost of medical treatment, including surgery, and that Guan may need further operations. The Chinese government's forestry department and the local administration also agreed to compensate the villagers. The incident highlights the potential dangers faced by wildlife, particularly pandas, and the importance of protecting these animals' habitats and ensuring their safety. Despite the compensation, the villagers expressed satisfaction with the amount, which will cover their medical expenses and could potentially lead to further operations if necessary.

The legislation, which takes effect immediately, removes the criminalization of possession of up to 2 oz (56.6g) of marijuana and allows the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The National Security Minister, Peter Bunting, stated that the legislation does not intend to soften Jamaica's stance on drug trafficking or cultivate illegal pot plots. The Jamaican government expects the legislation to strengthen the country's position on international drug control and the legalization of medical marijuana. The legislation aims to address the cultural and social aspects of marijuana usage in Jamaica, which has long been viewed as a taboo subject due to its prohibition.

The move comes as Jamaica faces challenges related to drug trafficking and the legalization of illegal pot plots. The legislation has received support from both domestic and international stakeholders, including the United States Assistant Secretary for Counter-Narcotics Affairs, who expressed confidence in Jamaica's adherence to international drug conventions.

{"pred": "The Internet Archive is undertaking a project to preserve and archive web pages as they are created, with the aim of preserving links to the original versions of those pages. This initiative aims to address broken links on the web, which can lead to users being unable to access content or experiencing a 404 error. The project involves crawling websites that support the \"No More 404\" site protocol, which ensures that any pages that are not found due to a broken link are automatically redirected to their corresponding archived version. By doing so, the Internet Archive aims to create a permanent record of the content on the web, ensuring that users can easily find and access previously published information without having to rely on broken links. This project is significant for several reasons:\n\n1. Preservation of Web Content: The preservation of web pages helps maintain the integrity of the internet by preserving the original content and its context. When a page is no longer available or has been moved to a different location, it becomes difficult for users to access the original content. By archiving the pages that are referenced, the Internet Archive ensures that users have access to the same information even if the original source is removed or modified.\n\n2. Link Replacements: A broken link is a common issue on the web, where a user clicks on a link but is unable to access the desired content. The Internet Archive's project addresses this issue by creating a permanent link to the corresponding archived version of the page. This allows users to continue accessing the original content without encountering a 404 error, providing a seamless browsing experience.\n\n3. Accessibility: The No More 404 site protocol ensures that web pages do not disappear entirely after being updated or deleted. Instead, the pages are redirected to their corresponding archived versions, allowing users to access the original content while preserving the link to the original page. This approach promotes accessibility, as users who were unable to access the original content before can now access it through the preserved link.\n\n4. Historical Significance: Archiving pages that reference them helps preserve the history of the web, including changes made to the content over time. This information can be valuable for researchers, historians, and anyone interested in understanding how the web evolved. By preserving these pages, the Internet Archive ensures that future generations can learn about the evolution of web technology and the impact of changes made to the web over time.\n\n5.

The Gibson Guitar Corporation, led by CEO Henry Juszkiewicz, was raided in 2011 by federal marshals who seized wood from three Nashville facilities and shut down production. The government claims that Gibson knowingly imported illegally sourced wood from Madagascar, a country known for its illegal logging practices, and that the company violated the Lacey Act, a century-old law that requires end users of endangered wood to verify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. The government argues that Gibson's imports from Madagascar were a violation of the Lacey Act, which retroactively applies to plant-based materials such as rosewood and ebony. The Gibson Guitar Corporation maintains that all of its wood purchases from Madagascar have been obtained in accordance with U.S. and Malagasy law, and that the company has provided documents to support its claim. However, the government has filed a court motion asserting that Gibson's imports from Madagascar were indeed illegal, citing emails that appear to show Gibson maintaining a supply chain that has been linked to illegal logging. The article notes that the Lacey Act is a rare example of a case where the government has successfully prosecuted a company for violating environmental regulations, but it has faced criticism for being retroactive and potentially leading to the loss of a significant portion of the guitar industry's market. The article also highlights the concerns of guitar builders like attorney Ronald Bienstock, who warn of potential legal complications for clients who own vintage guitars and warns them to be cautious of purchasing from overseas sources. Overall, the legal battle over the legality of wood imports from Madagascar continues, with the government seeking to establish the authenticity of the wood's origin and the company defending its compliance with local laws.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week. NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \"It's a nightmare,\" says a dealer. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 1352}

{"pred": "The study published in the Journal of Science provides new evidence for the existence of an ocean on Mars, with a high concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere. The study, led by Geronimo Villanueva at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, analyzed the Martian atmosphere using three of the world's most powerful infrared telescopes and found that the water vapor present in the Martian atmosphere contained both ordinary hydrogen and heavy deuterium. The study estimates that the planet's water had a high proportion of deuterium, with a concentration of seven times that of Earth's ocean, indicating a significant loss of water on Mars compared to Earth's oceans. The study suggests that the ancient ocean on Mars may have covered a significant part of the planet's surface, with a depth of at least 450 feet (137 meters), and that the water was lost to space over a period of at least 600 million years. The study also finds that the Martian atmosphere was much richer in heavy hydrogen, suggesting that the planet was at least 10 times more dense than Earth's atmosphere. The study's findings challenge previous theories that the Martian atmosphere was relatively stable and lacked the necessary conditions for life to exist. The study's conclusion supports the possibility of life on Mars, although the exact number of water on Mars is still uncertain.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The case has implications for chocolate brands operating in the EU, with some arguing that the shape is already protected in certain countries and others seeking to protect it across the entire bloc. The outcome of the case will likely affect the future of the Kit Kat trademark, with Nestlé potentially losing its EU registration for the shape. Additionally, the case has also highlighted the importance of protecting trademarks in the context of Brexit, with the UK government considering cutting ties with the EU over the perceived infringement of a beloved British treat first purchased by Rowntree.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": "Two recent studies have revealed a breakthrough in the ability to visualize and interpret the inner workings of human visual experiences using brain activity. Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer program that uses brain activity patterns to reconstruct YouTube videos, a previously unattainable task due to the complexity of visual perception. The study involved recording brain activity from participants during a series of YouTube videos, which were then processed using a machine learning algorithm to identify similarities between neural activity and the videos. The resulting reconstructed videos feature subtle changes in brain activity patterns that correspond to specific visual elements, such as shapes, movements, and colors. The researchers believe that this technology has the potential to provide insights into the inner workings of the human mind, including dreaming, memories, and even the manipulation of visual stimuli. However, the technology's limitations lie in the fact that it only captures a fraction of the brain's overall functionality, and the nature of visual perception is still unknown. The study's findings suggest that the technology holds promise for applications beyond entertainment, such as monitoring brain activity in courtrooms to determine accuracy in memory interpretations. Additionally, the researchers argue that the technology may be useful in detecting and interpreting false memories, although the feasibility of such applications is currently limited by the nature of memory itself. Overall, the study highlights the ongoing efforts to unravel the mysteries of human cognition and perception, with the potential to revolutionize fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and criminal justice.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed.

The report shows that obesity rates have risen across all continents, with the highest rates occurring in the Middle East and North Africa, followed by Asia, where obesity rates are particularly high. In the United States, obesity rates have been steadily increasing, with 13% of the population being obese, while the remaining 87% are either overweight or obese. The study also highlights the impact of obesity on various health risks, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study found that obesity rates have significantly increased in both developed and developing countries, with no country achieving a complete reduction in obesity rates. The study suggests that obesity is a major risk factor for numerous health issues, including increased calorie intake, changes in diet composition, decreased physical activity, and the rise of sedentary lifestyles. The study also identifies the role of affordable access to unhealthy foods and the rise in the availability of these foods in the modern world as contributing factors to obesity.

(Just to keep things in perspective, we'll point out that Look is the sort of magazine that also runs headlines like, \"Royal Bodyguard Warns: 'Kate Middleton's Baby Is In Danger!'\") In other news, Huffington Post notes that it's Cruise's 51st birthday."], "all_classes": null, "length": 790}

The couple's deaths have raised questions about the circumstances surrounding their deaths, with some reporting a murder-suicide theory, while others suggest it was a tragic accident. The couple's families and friends have expressed shock and disbelief at the news, with one expressing disbelief that the couple's deaths were a result of a murder-suicide. The couple had four children and had recently welcomed a grandchild, and their net worth was estimated to be $4.77 billion, making them the 15th wealthiest person in Canada.

Police, who have described the deaths as \"suspicious,\" revealed Sunday that the cause of death for both Shermans was \"ligature neck compression,\" a form of strangulation, the CBC reports. Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists.

Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later.

{"pred": "The Egyptian government has announced that the third round of the country's parliamentary elections will focus on delivering a clear majority to the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, which has emerged as the leading candidate. The Brotherhood, which has been the dominant political force in Egypt since the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak, is expected to secure a majority of seats in the full Parliament, potentially giving it a significant advantage over the ruling military and other parties. The Brotherhood's campaign has emphasized its commitment to democracy and human rights, while the military rulers have yet to specify the formula for allocating seats based on party affiliation. The Brotherhood's efforts to form alliances with the liberals and the progressive forces have raised concerns about the stability of the upcoming government and the challenges it will face in managing the transition period. The prosecution of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and his son Gamal Mubarak is expected to highlight the extent of the corruption and authoritarianism in the Mubarak era, with the Brotherhood accusing the former leader of implementing a \"tyranny\" and attempting to install his son in his position. The final round of the vote is set to determine the composition of the new government, with the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party aiming for a majority of seats in the full Parliament. The Egyptian military rulers have yet to reveal the mechanism for allocating seats among parties, and the Brotherhood's allies, including the Free Egyptians and the social democratic parties, have expressed reservations about the possibility of a challenging period ahead. The Brotherhood has stated that it aims to form a coalition or unity government, avoiding the need for one, and the possibility of a military-led government. The Brotherhood's stance on the issue of the military's role in the transition process and its desire to maintain the legitimacy of the current government are likely to play a crucial role in shaping the outcome of the elections. The final round of voting is set to take place on Jan. 23, with the Egyptian military holding the upper hand in the election process.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "A car in a red Toyota Corolla was suspended from a telephone wire in Mendon, Massachusetts, due to a driver's quick response to a GPS unit's directions. The driver, Nabila Altahan, and her passenger were not injured in the incident, which occurred around 8 p.m. on Wednesday evening. According to police, the car was westbound on Route 4 in Mendon when a GPS device provided sudden directions to turn around, causing the car to leave its intended destination and end up suspended on the guy wire. A witness at the nearby miniature golf course reported seeing the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended. The state police officer who witnessed the incident was driving and was able to stop the car before it hit the ground.

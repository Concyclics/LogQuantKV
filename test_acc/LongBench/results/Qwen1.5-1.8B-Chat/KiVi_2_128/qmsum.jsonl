To accomplish this, he experimented with a system that uses fewer Gaussians per state, resulting in a smaller overall model size, potentially allowing for a more efficient implementation. Additionally, he mentioned that the system is designed to be simple and easy to understand, which suggests that it might be suitable for a small-scale research project. By implementing a simpler architecture, with fewer states per unit, and a smaller number of Gaussian filters, the system can be trained effectively to recognize the German language.

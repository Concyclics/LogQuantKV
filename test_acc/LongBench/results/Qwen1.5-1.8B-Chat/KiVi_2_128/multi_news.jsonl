However, the Illinois appeals court upheld his conviction, stating that the evidence presented was sufficient to prove McCullough's guilt. McCullough's lawyer, DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack, stated that the FBI and state investigators had thoroughly examined the case and found insufficient evidence to support McCullough's conviction.

{"pred": "The Shroud of Turin, a centuries-old artifact believed to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, has been found to be a fake, according to a new forensic investigation. The researchers at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and the University of Pavia in Italy analyzed the bloodstain pattern on the cloth, finding it to be inconsistent with the expected placement of bloodstains on a crucified man or a face-down body. The researchers used a living subject and a mannequin to examine the flow of blood on wounds on the left hand, the forearm, the shoulder, and the lower back. They found that the bloodstains on the cloth are inconsistent, with some appearing to be from a standing position, while others are inconsistent with the position of the body. The researchers concluded that the cloth is likely a medieval forgery, not a true depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus. The researchers tested the bloodstains on the cloth with real and synthetic blood samples, and the results showed that the cloth is a mix of both, with some patches showing human blood and others showing a mixture of blood and paint. The researchers also found that the bloodstains on the cloth do not match the actual bloodstains found on the crucifixion wounds of Jesus, indicating that the cloth may have been a fake. The researchers believe that the cloth may have been created as a medieval art or didactic representation of the crucifixion process. The researchers conclude that the cloth is a fake, pointing to the possibility that it is a medieval forgery and not a true depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus. The researchers say that the findings raise questions about the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin and suggest that it may not be a genuine religious relic.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says. (There's a giant \"super henge\" under Stonehenge.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1428}

The tax is seen as a measure to encourage people to drink less sugary beverages, but it has also led to decreased sales and displacement of shopping from the city. The Seattle City Council is considering a bill to remove the tax, but it faces opposition from the beverage industry and community organizations. The tax is expected to generate revenue for the city, but critics argue that it may not address the issue of reducing health risks associated with excessive consumption of sugary beverages.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

Arias worked for Intermex as a sales executive and was paid $7,250 per month. However, Arias was asked to install an app called Xora, which allowed her boss, John Stubits, to track her location 24/7. Despite her objections, Stubits claimed that employees would be monitored while off-duty and that the GPS function of the app was used to monitor her location, which violated her privacy. Arias' attorney, Gail Glick, argues that the app's GPS function was a violation of California law and that the company's actions were illegal. The app allowed her boss, Stubits, to track her location and monitor her movements, including GPS tracking, which was not turned off when Arias left the office.

{"pred": "The government shutdown is a looming threat as House Republicans and Senate Democrats are locked in a fierce battle over the funding for federal agencies, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The House has proposed a plan to delay the implementation of the ACA, which includes a one-year delay of the law and a repeal of the law's tax on medical devices. The Senate has agreed to a bill that would allow the government to continue funding the ACA, but the bill includes a provision that would repeal the law's tax on medical devices. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill later this week, and the House is likely to reject it, leaving the government facing a showdown with the House on the ACA. The Senate is expected to convene on Monday to consider a short-term funding bill to prevent a government shutdown, but the prospects of a deal appear slim. The Senate is divided along party lines, with some Republicans calling for a government shutdown and others supporting a compromise. The ACA is a key issue in the ongoing government shutdown negotiations, and the fate of the healthcare law hangs in the balance. The shutdown could have significant consequences for the federal government, including a loss of federal funding, a slowdown in government services, and a decline in tourism and other industries. The shutdown could also harm the Democratic Party in the upcoming election cycle, as it has become a highly polarizing issue among Americans. The stakes are high, and the outcome will depend on the actions of House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who are leading the fight against the ACA. The government shutdown could have a significant impact on the economy, with potential losses in federal spending, job losses, and a disruption in the healthcare system. The government shutdown could also cause widespread economic damage, particularly in the Washington region, where the federal government accounts for one-third of the economy. The ACA is a complex issue with deep implications for the country's future, and the fate of the ACA will determine the future of the Affordable Care Act and the broader health insurance market.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The lion, which was previously a protected species, was shot multiple times by rangers after it injured a man in Isinya, a town near Nairobi, Kenya. The man was a resident of the area and was surrounded by a crowd of people who took photos and threw stones at the lion. The lion was then tranquilized and shot to death by rangers, who claimed that it was necessary to prevent further harm to the man. The incident highlights the challenges faced by wildlife officials in managing the delicate balance between protecting wildlife and conserving the remaining lions, as their populations have declined due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflicts with livestock herders. The incident also led to calls for the relocation of lions to other areas, with some residents killing them before authorities arrived. The Kenya Wildlife Service confirmed that the lion was killed in a wildlife migration area outside the park's southern section, which is not fenced, and that the lion was attempting to establish new territory. The situation of the two incidents in Kenya, including the death of a lion in South Africa, highlighted the difficulties faced by wildlife officials in balancing the need for protection against lions with the conservation of the species.

The study involved monitoring the weight and body weight of 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over a median of five years. The study adjusted for various risk factors, including age, cholesterol levels, and previous heart conditions. The researchers observed that individuals with the highest weight fluctuations had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attacks, a 116% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death, compared to those with minimal weight fluctuations. The study also found a strong association between yo-yo dieting and increased risk of new-onset diabetes, suggesting that maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for preventing and managing CAD. However, the study's design did not establish a causal relationship between yo-yo dieting and CAD, but it highlights the potential long-term health implications of this behavior for individuals with pre-existing CAD.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

The study found that younger patients were more likely to develop advanced-stage colorectal cancer, with 30% of patients having advanced-stage cancer, indicating that screening guidelines should be adjusted to start at a younger age.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

{"pred": "The article discusses three different ways in which advanced civilizations can potentially dominate the universe through the process of capturing and extracting energy from stars. The first step involves harvesting all of the planet's resources, followed by the second step of capturing all of the star's energy, and finally, the third step of harvesting all the energy from all the stars within a specific galaxy. The author, astrophysicist and senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, proposes that such a civilization would be able to achieve a level of technological advancement that surpasses human levels, making it impossible for the universe to leave them alone in the vastness of space. The author suggests that advanced civilizations would create a spherical shell around a star, known as a \"statite,\" which would gather all the energy in the star and then use it to propel the entire ball of energy back towards the planet that wants to use it. The author argues that such a civilization would understand the grim reality of the expanding universe and would not simply sit idle, but rather would actively capture and harvest stars to enhance their own capabilities. The paper adds a new twist by proposing that such a civilization would be able to harness the immense energy stored in the stars themselves, potentially leading to advanced civilizations that are thousands or even millions of years older than humanity. The article highlights the importance of understanding the inevitability of the universe's expansion and the necessity of capturing and utilizing energy from other stars to ensure that humanity remains in control of the universe. The paper also mentions that the author believes that advanced civilizations would recognize the signs of an alien civilization, such as the presence of massive stars and the unusual galaxies hosting them, and would take note of these celestial bodies.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "The Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya contains evidence of a long period of climate-induced behavioral adaptations by early Homo sapiens, leading to the development of a more advanced set of stone tools and pigments. The Olorgesailie Basin is located in the Acheulian culture of the Early Stone Age, which dates back to around 300,000 years ago. The discovery of these stone tools and pigments suggests that early humans in the Olorgesailie Basin were able to develop and use these technologies, possibly due to the influence of climate change and the need to adapt to changing environments. The team of researchers believe that these advancements in tool-making and pigments were likely a result of a gradual shift from a more primitive approach to a more sophisticated set of tools and pigments, which were made from obsidian and a variety of other materials. The Olorgesailie Basin is the first location to provide evidence of the Middle Stone Age, which began around 300,000 years ago, and the earliest recorded Middle Stone Age technology in the entire continent. The Olorgesailie Basin is home to a significant amount of obsidian, which is likely sourced from at least 25 to 50 kilometers away, and the Olorgesailie Basin contains evidence of Middle Stone Age artifacts, indicating the widespread adoption of these technologies and the development of social networks during this time period.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

However, a Canadian court ruled in 1999 that Katriuk had lied about his voluntary service for Germany and obtained Canadian citizenship, despite the fact that he could have faced the consequences of his actions. Katriuk's death comes as Russia charges him with involvement in the 1943 killings in Khatyn, a town in Belarus, which was then part of Ukraine. Katriuk lived in Quebec for more than 60 years and was a beekeeper until his death. His lawyer, Orest Rudzik, said Katriuk was ill and had suffered from dementia and heart problems. The Canadian government has ignored Katriuk's appeals and has not recognized his citizenship, citing Russia's annexation of Crimea and interference in Ukraine. The federal court ordered Russia to allow Katriuk to be tried for alleged war crimes, but he would have had to comply with the German law. The Russian government has launched a criminal case against Katriuk in Moscow, hoping to hold him accountable for his alleged participation in the atrocities committed in the Second World War.

The new law removes the criminalization of possession of up to 2 oz (56.6g) of marijuana, making it a non-criminal offense.

The legislation has been met with mixed reactions, with some arguing that it will lead to increased drug trafficking and others expressing concern about the potential for the drug to be used for criminal activities. The National Security Minister emphasized the importance of enforcing Jamaican law and maintaining its sovereignty in the global fight against drug trafficking. The legislation is expected to have a positive impact on the Jamaican economy, particularly in the medical marijuana industry, which has long been a major contributor to the country's economic growth.

Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times. Israel has now hit 250 Gaza targets, while taking further steps toward a ground invasion, calling up 16,000 reservists, the Wall Street Journal reports. It's also steadily sending troops and armored vehicles to the border, notes CNN—between 1,500 and 2,000 are already there, one official said. Israel claims the attacks have weakened Hamas' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but Hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple Israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with Hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new Egyptian regime would be more active in helping the Palestinians. \"The time has changed,\" he said. \"No longer the Israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the Palestinians without being held responsible. That time is far bygone.\" For its part, the Obama administration says it's seeking help from Arab countries in calling on Hamas to relent. \"The onus rests squarely on Hamas ... to stop its rocket attacks,\" says a State Department spokesman.

The raccoon approached her and bit her thumb, causing her to panic and attempt to defend herself with her bare hands. Borch's mother, Elizabeth, helped her release the raccoon from her grip and brought it to her home. Borch was bitten by the raccoon and was rushed to the center for treatment, where she was treated for rabies. The raccoon was found to be infected with rabies, and the Maine Warden Service confirmed that it tested positive for the deadly virus. Borch has already received six shots, including the rabies vaccine, and is scheduled to receive her final shot this weekend. In addition to rabies, there have been 20 animals in Maine that have tested positive for rabies in 2017, with 64 cases reported in the previous year.

Borch's experience highlights the importance of being cautious when encountering wild animals, especially those with a history of aggression.

{"pred": "The scientific community has discovered that Mars had a significant amount of water, with an average of seven times the amount found on Earth's oceans, during the early stages of the planet's formation. The water was lost due to the gradual evaporation of ordinary water, with the heavier form remaining in the atmosphere. The Martian atmosphere has thinned over time, leading to a much deeper ocean covering a fifth of the planet's surface, with the water being lost to space. The ancient ocean on Mars was found to be enriched in deuterium, with a high D/H ratio compared to Earth's oceans. The study reveals that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, with a substantial ocean covering a significant portion of its surface, including a potential ocean that covered a fifth of the planet's surface, and a potentially habitable environment for life to exist. The study suggests that Mars may have been habitable in the past, although the actual amount of water present is still uncertain.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The sequester, which is set to reduce federal spending by 2.5% without raising taxes, is expected to cause fear among politicians and result in a loss of confidence in Congress. However, the sequester is seen as a necessary measure to prevent the worst effects of the sequester, such as cuts to border security, airport security, and other non-defense-related programs. Despite the negative impact of the sequester, the House of Representatives has passed the legislation, with House Speaker John Boehner stating that the sequester is a \"brainchild\" of the Obama administration and that Congress must abandon the sequester to avoid the threat of higher taxes. The article also highlights the importance of the namesake of sequestration, former astronaut Neil Armstrong, and the fact that he is not being replaced by the death of another person, rather than the sequester.

However, a team of statisticians and engineers have developed a new approach to solving the puzzle. Using Bayes' theorem, they analyzed the data collected from various sources, including historical crashes, to determine the probability of the plane wreckage being located. The team divided the search area into two parts: a grid representing the probability of the plane being found in each region, and a second grid representing the probability of the plane being found in the area where the plane wreckage was discovered. The team used the historical data on previous searches and the likelihood of the plane wreckage being found in each area to create a probability distribution for each spot in the search area. The team then adjusted the probability of the plane wreckage being found in the second grid based on the new information and updated the probability estimate for each point in the area. The team used the information gathered from the black box and the cockpit voice recorder to calculate the probability of the plane wreckage being found in the area where the plane was last seen. The team also considered the possibility of the plane being found further away from the wreckage site, as well as the potential for the plane to be found in a different direction due to the ocean currents. The team used the historical data and the likelihood of the wreckage being found in the area where the plane was last seen to update the probability estimate. The team also considered the possibility of the plane wreckage being found in multiple areas, which could lead to a higher probability of the wreckage being found. The team's approach involves combining the probability of the wreckage being found in different areas, taking into account the uncertainty of the data and adjusting the probability estimate accordingly. The team's work helps to refine the search for the plane wreckage and provides a Bayesian approach to the problem, allowing for the incorporation of new information and improving the chances of finding the wreckage.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

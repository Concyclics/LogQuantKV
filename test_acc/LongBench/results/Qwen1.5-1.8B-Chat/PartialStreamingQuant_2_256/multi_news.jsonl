Kalashnikov was born in 1925 and grew up during the Soviet Union's darkest hour, where the Red Army suffered a severe shortage of weapons due to the war. As a result, Kalashnikov became fascinated by the idea of creating a simple yet effective weapon that could defend his country against enemy forces.\n\nAfter years of research and experimentation, Kalashnikov designed the AK-47, which he initially submitted to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church for approval. The letter he wrote to the head of the church, Patriarch Kirill, expressed his deep spiritual pain over the loss of countless lives and the guilt he felt for the victims, even if they were enemies. The letter detailed Kalashnikov's thoughts on the morality of the AK-47 and its role in defending his country, rather than serving as a tool for terrorist activities like those carried out by child soldiers.\n\nThe article also mentions that Kalashnikov's designs were widely acclaimed and recognized, earning him numerous honors such as the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labor. Despite his success, Kalashnikov remained humble and dedicated to his craft, believing that his weapon should only be used to defend his country and not for any malicious purposes.\n\nThe article highlights the Russian Orthodox Church's stance on the AK-47, emphasizing its support for the designers and soldiers who utilize the weapon.

The evidence included new phone records, which showed a collect call made to McCullough's home in Sycamore at 6:57 p.m. on December 3, 1957, and a collection of documents from 21 individuals who claimed to have seen McCullough in the area at the time of the abduction.

The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke-extracted MRSA was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA, indicating that cigarette smoke alters the cell walls of MRSA, allowing it to resist bacterial cell division and colonization. Additionally, the study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke-extracted MRSA became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which further enhance the bacterium's ability to invade human cells and cause pneumonia. The findings suggest that cigarette smoke functions like an alarm to MRSA, making it more difficult for the bacteria to survive and spread within the body.

The researchers found that the bloodstains on the cloth are inconsistent with each other, with some appearing to be from a standing model and others from a face-down position.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The coup, which took place on March 22, saw the overthrow of the previous president, Amadou Toumani Touré, and the establishment of a new regime headed by Capt. Amadou Sanogo. The rebels, primarily the Tuareg Tuareg people, have sought to establish an independent Tuareg state called Azawad, with the aim of restoring the country's sovereignty and autonomy. The conflict has caused widespread disruption, with fuel shortages, power outages, and a humanitarian crisis affecting the region. The West African leaders have responded swiftly to the crisis, forming a diplomatic emergency committee and imposing sanctions on the CNRDRE. The French-based United Nations has warned of the impact of the coup on the Sahel region and urged the international community to support the efforts to restore constitutional order and protect the unity of the region. The landlocked nation of Mali relies heavily on imports, and the Tuareg rebels have taken advantage of the political situation to gain control of the northern part of the country, including the cities of Timbuktu, Gao, and Kidal, which are home to unique architecture, literature, and scientific heritage. The landlocked nation faces challenges such as limited access to fuel, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of refining capabilities.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

The investigation began when police announced that the four suspects had confessed to the murders of up to 60 people, based on a legend from the Andean region. However, subsequent investigations revealed that the claims were false, and the police had only been able to verify the existence of one victim. The chief of police, Miguel Hidalgo, stated that Murga would be placed on indefinite leave from his position due to the scandal, which damaged the reputation of the police unit. The police had previously denied knowledge of a group of kidnappers involved in the case, stating that they only confirmed the existence of one victim and that the fat was sold in the European market. The investigation faced criticism from medical professionals who argued that human fat cannot be obtained from a single person and that the use of the story to cover up the true circumstances of the crimes was unnecessary. Some anthropologists suggested that the police's story was a way to distract the public from the real issues facing Peru, such as drug trafficking and violence in the region. The chief of police, Jorge Espinoza, defended the decision to suspend Murga, stating that it was a mistake to rely solely on the legend to explain the crimes and that the investigation had been hindered by the lack of evidence.

The tax was introduced in 2017 to encourage healthier choices and reduce sugar intake, but it has led to a hike in prices and decreased sales at major retailers like Costco, causing frustration and calls for reform. The Seattle City Council ultimately approved the tax, but it faced criticism from some who argued that it targeted low-income communities and unfairly impacted businesses. The tax also triggered legal battles and resulted in the passage of a bill in Portland, Oregon, which repealed the tax after a public outcry. The tax has raised concerns about its effectiveness in reducing sugar consumption and its potential to drive out sales of healthier options. The tax has also had a negative impact on local businesses, with some retailers experiencing a decrease in sales and reduced profits. The tax has also been criticized for targeting healthy foods and beverages, such as those sold at Starbucks, and for leaving out other sugary drinks like those found at Seattle's Costco. The tax has also been seen as a way to generate revenue for the city, but critics argue that it is regressive and fails to address the root causes of obesity and diabetes. The tax has been met with resistance from retailers and businesses, who claim that it is a burden and that it drives out sales and reduces the overall economic impact of the tax.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

The attack was carried out by a sophisticated group of cybercriminals using a type of malware that allowed them to infiltrate Target's point-of-sale (POS) systems and steal data without detection. The malware was able to bypass security measures and steal data from transactions made during the holiday season, which may have impacted holiday sales and raised concerns about the potential for future breaches.\n\nThe report from a computer firm hired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) detailed the types of software used in the attack, including memory scraping capabilities that allowed the attackers to extract data from encrypted point-of-sale systems. The report also revealed that the malware was developed in Russia, with the memory scraping capability having been available in the country since at least 2009. The report further explained that the malware was executed covertly, using a combination of techniques to evade detection and steal data.\n\nThe report concluded that the attack was likely a result of a broader cybercrime campaign targeting multiple retailers, including Target, and that the perpetrators demonstrated innovation and expertise in exploiting vulnerabilities in POS systems. The report suggests that the malware was able to bypass security controls and gain access to the target's point-of-sale systems, allowing the attackers to steal data without detection.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of ongoing investigations by federal and private investigators, as well as the need for retailers to take proactive measures to protect their networks and data.

{"pred": "A new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine has found that individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD) who experience rapid weight fluctuations, also known as yo-yo dieting, have a significantly higher risk of heart attacks, stroke, and death compared to those with stable weight. The study involved monitoring the weight of 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over a median of five years, and tracked their weight changes over time. The study found that individuals with the highest weight variability had a 78% increase in the risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% increase in the risk of heart attack, a 136% increase in the risk of stroke, and a 124% increase in the risk of death. The study also found that yo-yo dieting was associated with a 124% increase in the risk of death, compared to those with stable weight. The study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy weight but noted that the study did not establish a causal relationship between yo-yo dieting and increased risk of heart disease. The study's findings highlight the potential long-term health implications of yo-yo dieting for individuals with pre-existing CAD, particularly those who experience significant weight fluctuations. The study's limitations include its observational nature, inability to determine the exact cause of weight fluctuations, and the lack of specificity in identifying the underlying mechanisms linking yo-yo dieting to increased risk of heart disease. Overall, the study underscores the need for individuals with CAD to maintain a healthy weight and emphasizes the importance of addressing weight fluctuations in this population to reduce the risk of heart disease and improve overall cardiovascular health.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another. And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

However, Markham refused to follow the doctor's orders and instead took Caleb to a natural or vegan doctor, claiming that she was following her religious beliefs and that the doctor's recommendations were based on animal products. The doctor informed Markham that Caleb was suffering from dehydration and needed medical attention, but Markham refused to comply with the doctor's order and instead took Caleb to a different doctor, who recommended a soy-based formula instead of the one prescribed by the original pediatrician.

The study analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute's National Cancer Registry and found that 37,847 out of 258,000 colorectal cancer patients were younger than 50, accounting for 15% of the total cases. The study highlights the importance of early detection and screening for young patients, especially those with advanced-stage cancer, as they tend to have a higher likelihood of surviving with treatment.

The study emphasizes the need for improved risk assessment and screening practices for young patients, particularly those with a family history of colorectal cancer.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The movie starts with a brief history lesson about the city's history of racial migrations and white flight, followed by the police response to the riots, which culminates in the deaths of three Black men. The film is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for its strong violence and profanity, and it's not for children. The film's main protagonist, a police officer named Krauss, is portrayed as a racist and brutalizer, leading to the deaths of three Black men. The film also touches on the racial divide in the United States, including the impact of color on employment opportunities, treatment by police, and the legacy of the Detroit riots. The film is not a character study but rather a historical fiction piece that highlights the injustice and anger felt by the people, especially for those who are still living in the aftermath of the riots.

The board members, including CEO Elon Musk, have met several times over the past week to discuss the implications of a private company for Tesla's long-term interests and the funding needed to secure a private transaction. The board's statement includes discussions around the need for a private valuation, the possibility of additional funding, and the board's satisfaction with Musk's proposal. However, the board's statement leaves open the question of whether they were satisfied with Musk's timing and the timing of the announcement, suggesting that the timing may not have been entirely accurate. The board's statement also raises concerns about the transparency surrounding the announcement, with the timing of the announcement being questioned and the board's response to the potential public disclosure. The board's statement is significant as it marks the largest deal in history, surpassing the previous largest acquisition by a consortium, the purchase of utility TXU Corp. for $44bn in 2007. The board's decision to hold off on making the announcement until after the company's 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which didn't mention the potential private acquisition, suggests that the board was satisfied with the company's financial position and the potential for a private valuation. The board's statement also highlights the potential conflict of interest between Musk's desire to take the company private and the need for the company to remain publicly traded, with the board stating that the company is the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market and that the public perception of the company being a target of investors' attacks is a factor in the timing of the announcement.

{"pred": "The article discusses three steps that a civilization must take to dominate the universe in three easy steps: harvesting all of its planet's resources, harvesting all of its star's energy, and harvesting all of the energy from all the stars in its local galaxy before moving on to another galaxy. The author, astrophysicist and senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, proposes that the presence of dark energy in the universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate, making it necessary to expand the universe to ensure that it remains isolated from the rest of the universe. The author adds that any advanced civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will expand throughout the universe, attempting to secure as many stars as possible before they become completely inaccessible. The article suggests that any sufficiently advanced civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will create a swarm of satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" which would be able to capture and haul back to the home galaxy any stars that are currently in the process of becoming unavailable due to the inevitable expansion of the universe. The article also mentions that the vast majority of advanced civilizations will be of Type III, which harnesses all the energy of a galaxy, and that Type III civilizations may reach Type III in a few hundred thousand to a million years. The article highlights the importance of understanding the grim reality of the universe and the necessity of capturing and harnessed energy from other galaxies to avoid running out of it. The article concludes by suggesting that the search for advanced alien civilizations will likely involve studying the light signatures from galaxies that have had their useful stars removed by advanced civilizations, as well as observing the unusual galaxies that have had their star-harvesting civilizations. The article emphasizes the importance of developing accurate instruments to detect such light signatures and the potential for human astronomers to discover these alien civilizations before they become fully aware of them.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Santorum also criticized Romney's use of the term \"serious conservative,\" suggesting that he meant a strict adherence to traditional conservative values rather than a genuine commitment to conservative principles.\n\nRomney's campaign dismissed Santorum's claim, arguing that he had a long history of making false statements about himself. The Texas politician and former Massachusetts governor stated that he would not be able to define \"serious conservatism\" in the same way as Santorum did, and that he would have to explain his position further in order to convince the public that he was a serious candidate. In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley, Santorum expressed surprise that Romney had won both the straw poll and the nationwide surveys of conservative voters, indicating that he believed the former Massachusetts governor had a strong grasp of the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, newly appointed White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew acknowledged that President Obama's position on birth control and Catholic institutions had been consistent, despite the recent accommodation made by the administration. According to Lew, the president's stance on these issues has been based on a \"consistent approach\" that includes addressing the concerns of religious leaders and ensuring that policies align with the values of the Catholic Church.

The Olorgesailie Basin was once a lush, grassland ecosystem, but over time, the landscape shifted to become a desert due to climate change. The Olorgesailie Basin is home to a variety of stone tools, including handaxes, which were shaped like tears and had rounded ends and a pointed end. The researchers believe that these tools were used for both cutting and hunting, and that the technology was well-established by 300,000 years ago. The Olorgesailie Basin also contains evidence of pigment, which was likely used to decorate objects or mark individuals' identities. The team's findings challenge previous assumptions about the emergence of modern human behaviors, such as symbols, and suggest that these behaviors emerged earlier in the history of human evolution. The Olorgesailie Basin provides evidence of complex social networks and the exchange of raw materials, which are seen as a sign of technological innovation and social organization. The Olorgesailie Basin also shows evidence of the exchange of pigments, which were likely used to decorate objects or mark individuals' identities. The Olorgesailie Basin is located in southern Kenya, and the team's findings suggest that human societies in the region were already well-established by 300,000 years ago, and the technology they developed was not limited to modern hunter-gatherers but extended to include more complex societies. The Olorgesailie Basin is the first to document the Middle Stone Age in the entire continent, and the Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age tools are the oldest of their kind. The Olorgesailie Basin's Acheulian culture consists of mainly hand axes, while the Middle Stone Age includes smaller, more specialized tools such as points and blades, which were likely used for cutting and scraping. The Olorgesailie Basin's Acheulian culture is characterized by the use of a wider variety of stone tools, which were made with fine-grained materials and possibly sharpened in a way that allowed for efficient cutting. The Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age tools were made from obsidian that originated from at least 25 to 50 kilometers away, and the team's research suggests that these tools were well-established by 300,000 years ago.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

The airline is also introducing push notifications for passengers to be notified when boarding begins, which will help manage the boarding process and ensure that passengers are aware of their boarding group. The new boarding process is part of a larger agreement between United Airlines, its partner airlines, and other airlines, which is expected to lead to increased competition and improve overall value for customers and the marketplace. The agreement is expected to be approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation and other regulatory agencies, and the new boarding lanes and gateside notifications are expected to roll out to airports this week.

Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today.

The procedure involved removing the rib cartilage from both sides of Kieran's body and shaping it into a framework for his ears. The surgeons used a template of Kieran's mother's ears as a guide, ensuring that the ear shapes closely resemble her own.

The incident occurred when a panda wandered into the village of Liziba, where local officials were attempting to capture it. The animal bit the villager in the leg, causing significant damage and leaving him with a lengthy recovery process. The victim's lawyer, Wang Chaohui, represented him in negotiations with the local forestry officials and the nearby Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, resulting in a settlement of 520,000 yuan.

The incident highlights the challenges faced by wildlife conservation efforts in China, particularly in terms of protecting endangered species like pandas, which are often targeted by poachers due to their high reproductive rates and vulnerability to habitat loss. Despite the compensation, the panda's aggressive behavior remains a concern for both locals and tourists alike, as it has previously caused attacks on humans, including a 20-year-old man who was bitten by a panda while visiting a zoo in southern China. The incident underscores the importance of effective wildlife protection measures, including stricter regulations and increased enforcement, to ensure the safety of both humans and wildlife.

The legislation, which takes effect immediately, removes the criminalization of possession of up to 2 oz (56.6g) of marijuana and allows the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The National Security Minister, Peter Bunting, stated that the legislation does not intend to soften Jamaica's stance on drug trafficking or cultivate illegal pot plots, but rather enforces Jamaican law and upholds international treaty obligations. The new law aims to address the cultural and social aspects of marijuana usage, particularly among the Rastafarian community, while also allowing tourists to legally purchase small amounts of ganja for medical purposes. The legislation has sparked debates and discussions regarding decriminalizing the drug, but the Jamaican government believes it will not compromise its sovereignty and maintain strict enforcement of Jamaican law. The move is seen as a positive step towards addressing the long-standing issue of marijuana prohibition in Jamaica, which has been a source of controversy and economic activity for decades. The legislation sets the stage for the establishment of a regulated medical marijuana industry, which could lead to the growth of the industry and the development of innovative products.

The ancient ocean covering half of Mars' surface was estimated to have been lost to space, equivalent to a global ocean covering Earth's surface at least 137 meters deep. The study analyzed the Martian atmosphere's water vapor, revealing the chemical composition of the vapor, with heavy hydrogen being present at seven times the ratio of deuterium on Earth. The study suggests that Mars may have lost a substantial amount of water, equivalent to a global ocean covering 450 meters deep, which was likely present during the planet's early development. The study also finds evidence of a warm and wet climate on Mars, with rivers, deltas, and lakes existing in the region, suggesting a potential for life to exist on the planet. The study supports the idea that Mars was once habitable, although the actual amount of water present is still uncertain. The study's findings are supported by the recent detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere, which suggests the presence of life on the planet. The study's conclusion is that Mars was once much wetter and warmer than it is today, with the water being primarily in liquid form and the planet's atmosphere being rich in heavy hydrogen.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The EUIPO will now consider the evidence and decide whether to protect the shape of the four-fingered wafer biscuits in the EU, potentially leading to a wider protection for Kit Kat's trademark. This decision comes as a setback for Nestlé, which has been battling the shape trademark for more than a decade, arguing that it owns the shape of the four-fingered wafer. The case has also highlighted the importance of protecting national trademarks in the EU, particularly in巧克力和糖果领域, where there are varying historical and cultural backgrounds in each country. The case has been closely watched by trademark lawyers, who argue that it could lead to a loss of protection for Kit Kat's trademark in some countries. Additionally, the ruling has sparked a debate in the UK, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU and others advocating for maintaining EU trademark protections.

In his appeal, Tsarnaev argued that the media coverage of the attacks and his own role in the tragedy prevented him from receiving a fair trial in Boston, where the marathon was held. The defense cited a Supreme Court ruling that defined the term \"crime of violence\" as potentially vague, leading to questions about the validity of the death penalty in the case. The prosecution countered that the trial was necessary to ensure justice and that the death penalty is constitutional. The appeal sought a change of venue, but the judge denied the request, citing the publicity surrounding the event and the need for a neutral location. Despite the news, the federal government has not yet executed any of the 340 prisoners on death row, with only three having been executed in the past 50 years. The appeal focuses on the lack of consistency in the use of capital punishment across the country, with some states deploying the federal government to handle the cases. The defense argues that the federal government's jurisdiction extends beyond individual states, making it difficult to execute prisoners like Tsarnaev, who was involved in a terrorist attack that caused significant public attention.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, used functional MRI scans to measure the brain activity of individuals while watching YouTube videos. The brain activity patterns were then used to train a computer model to recognize and reconstruct the corresponding videos, resulting in a continuous, abstract representation of the original videos. The model identified subtle changes in brain activity patterns that corresponded to specific visual elements, including shapes, movements, and color schemes. The reconstructed videos were created by layering multiple YouTube clips onto a single brain activity pattern, revealing a dreamlike and surreal image of the video. This technology has the potential to provide insights into the brain's ability to process dynamic visual experiences, such as dreams and thoughts, and could potentially be applied to various fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and criminal justice. However, the technology's accuracy and limitations depend on the nature of the visual experiences being analyzed, as well as the feasibility of interpreting them accurately in court settings.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

A source tells UK magazine Look the actor sent Holmes an \"emotional letter\" looking to, at the very least, be friends again, Australia's News Network reports. \"It's like he's finally recognized that Katie will always be the love of his life,\" the source says. Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one. (Just to keep things in perspective, we'll point out that Look is the sort of magazine that also runs headlines like, \"Royal Bodyguard Warns: 'Kate Middleton's Baby Is In Danger!'\") In other news, Huffington Post notes that it's Cruise's 51st birthday."], "all_classes": null, "length": 790}

The couple were found dead in their Toronto mansion on Friday, with their bodies discovered hanging from a rail system in their basement lap pool. The police have stated that the deaths are being treated as a \"suspicious\" homicide, and the investigation remains ongoing. A Toronto police source revealed that someone outside the couple's home discovered the bodies, but the exact cause of their deaths is unknown. The couple's families and friends have expressed shock and disbelief at the deaths, with some suggesting that it could be a murder-suicide. The couple had four children and had recently welcomed a grandchild. They were known for their philanthropic efforts, particularly in the areas of charity and education. The couple's net worth was estimated to be $4.77 billion by Canadian Business, making them the 15th wealthiest person in the country. They were also known for their involvement in various charitable organizations and their dedication to investing in the city of Toronto. The couple's legacy includes founding Apotex, a global pharmaceutical company, and their philanthropy, which included donations to hospitals, universities, and the Jewish community. The couple's deaths have shocked the local community and raised questions about the circumstances surrounding their deaths. The police are investigating the case as a \"suspicious\" homicide, and the cause of death is believed to be a ligature neck compression, which means strangulation through the neck. The couple's real estate agent discovered their bodies in their home, and there were no signs of forced entry or suspects.

{"pred": "The first round of the Egyptian parliamentary elections, which took place after the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak, saw the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party emerge as the leading candidate, securing a majority of seats in the full Parliament. The Brotherhood, which has been the dominant force in Egypt's political landscape for decades, is expected to form a coalition government with the moderate Egyptian Bloc alliance, which includes the National Democratic Party and the Salafi party. The Brotherhood's grip on power has been weakened by the military's decision to delay the election until June, allowing the new government to be formed. The prosecution of Mubarak and his son Gamal Mubarak, who are charged with corruption and conspiracy to kill protesters, is expected to highlight the extent of the Brotherhood's influence in Egypt's politics and the need for accountability. The final round of voting in the election is expected to focus on the control of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, while the Brotherhood's allies, including the National Democratic Party and the Salafi party, aim to challenge the Brotherhood's dominance. The outcome of the election is uncertain, with the Brotherhood's party, which has pledged to form a coalition, playing a crucial role in shaping the political landscape. The Egyptian military's decision to retain its power and the lack of clarity on the allocation of seats in the new government are factors contributing to the uncertainty. The final round of voting is set to begin on Jan. 23, and the outcome of the election will determine the composition of the new government and the formation of a new era of democracy in Egypt.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes.

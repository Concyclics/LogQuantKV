This allows the system to adapt its processing accordingly, potentially reducing the impact of reverberation on the overall system.\nThe professor also mentions that the Aurora system uses a method called spectral subtraction, which involves subtracting the energy-based features from the raw speech signal.

The project manager started by discussing the current state of the project, including the buttons and layout of the remote control. The industrial designer presented their concept, which included a more rounded and ergonomic shape with a scroll button instead of traditional buttons. The marketing team expressed interest in the concept, but suggested using a scroll wheel instead of a single button for the menu. The user interface proposed a different approach, with a menu button and a scroll wheel, but the industrial designer argued that the scroll wheel would be more challenging to use due to its size and shape. The project manager agreed to consider the user interface's suggestion, and the meeting ended with the decision to proceed with the concept with a scroll wheel for the menu button.

The minutes include information about the tasks assigned, decisions made, and the progress made so far.\n\n2. New product requirements: The project manager mentions that the team needs to consider adding teletext functionality to the remote control, specifically for internet access. They mention that the target audience is younger individuals who may not have access to the internet, and teletext is a convenient alternative.\n\n3. Power button: The project manager discusses the need for separate channels on the remote control, with the option of having zero to nine channels or a range of numbers. They suggest using a separate button for each channel, making it easy to select the desired channel.\n\n4. Volume control: The project manager suggests using a single button for volume control, either for adjusting the volume or for changing the channel. They mention that the choice of button will depend on whether the remote control is intended for use on a TV or a device with a built-in speaker.\n\n5. Menu button: The project manager mentions that newer televisions may have menus, but the focus is on the simpler version for older televisions. They suggest including a menu button on the remote control, allowing users to navigate through the options without needing to open the menu on the TV itself.\n\n6. Cost considerations: The project manager acknowledges that the cost of a remote control is a significant factor, and they need to determine if the additional features (teletext, separate channels, volume control, and menu button) justify the increased cost.\n\n7.

They have observed that the addition of the MLP features to the network has led to improvements in some cases, but the overall performance has not significantly improved. The team acknowledges that the MSG problem remains a significant challenge, especially when the network is trained on a different language and noise environment. They suggest exploring alternative methods, such as multi-band training, to potentially address the language and noise dependencies. Additionally, the team mentions that the team needs to evaluate the impact of different training targets, noise types, and channels, and adjust the network accordingly to improve its performance.\nThey also note that the team's current efforts involve experimenting with various combinations of features and MLP outputs, including concatenating them with delta and delta - delta, and with PLP and mel cepstra. However, the team finds that the combination of these techniques does not consistently lead to significant improvements, and the team is considering other approaches, such as multi - band training, to explore different aspects of the problem. The team suggests that further research is needed to determine the optimal configuration and training strategy for the neural network to achieve the desired improvements.\nOverall, the team acknowledges that there is still room for improvement and that more experimentation is required to fully assess the effectiveness of their current approach.

Additionally, they considered using automatic feature extraction and noise removal techniques to extract relevant acoustic features from the raw audio data. The team also explored target selection and employed a soft thresholding method to select the optimal number of states for each model. Overall, the goal was to develop a robust and efficient back-end recognizer for the Aurora task that can effectively handle challenging audio signals and achieve accurate speech recognition.", "answers": ["PhD B was conducting an experiment to improve the backend performance of the Aurora recognizer.

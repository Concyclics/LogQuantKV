Kalashnikov, born in 1925 in Russia, developed the rifle during World War II, which saw the Red Army's severe shortage of weapons. After the war, Kalashnikov became disillusioned with the Soviet government's policies and began working on a more efficient and effective military solution. He eventually founded the Kalashnikov Design Bureau, where he worked on developing the AK-47, a semi-automatic rifle that revolutionized the battlefield.\n\nKalashnikov's letter to the Russian Orthodox Church, dated May 2012, expresses his deep regret for the deaths caused by the AK-47. He writes that he feels morally responsible for the countless lives lost due to the weapon's ability to kill without provocation. Kalashnikov attributes his guilt to his own desire for power and control, stating that he believed he was creating a tool to defend his country rather than a means of mass murder.\n\nDespite his guilt, Kalashnikov maintained a strong connection to his faith throughout his life. He was baptized at the age of 91 and attended celebrations marking his 90th birthday at the Kremlin in Moscow. The Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Cyril Alexander Volkov, received the letter and responded, emphasizing the importance of protecting the Fatherland and supporting the soldiers who use the AK-47.\n\nThe AK-47 has since become a symbol of armed resistance and has been adopted by various groups, including terrorist organizations and child soldiers. Despite its widespread popularity, Kalashnikov's guilt over the deaths caused by the weapon remains a contentious issue within Russian society. Some argue that he should have accepted responsibility for the loss of innocent lives, while others believe that his actions were driven by a sense of duty and necessity.\n\nThe article also highlights the role of the Russian Orthodox Church in shaping Kalashnikov's beliefs and values. The Church has sought to strengthen its influence through political connections and close ties with state agencies, emphasizing the importance of national defense and unity. Kalashnikov's letter to the Church reflects his belief in the need for a more just and ethical approach to warfare, particularly when it comes to the use of lethal force.\n\nOverall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of Kalashnikov's life and legacy, exploring his motivations, guilt, and impact on modern-day politics and military strategy.

The first study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego School of Medicine, found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became more resistant to the immune system's natural defenses, including macrophages, antimicrobial peptides, and reactive oxygen species. Specifically, the study found that MRSA exposed to smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA, indicating that cigarette smoke may contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of the bacteria.\n\nThe second study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine a year earlier, explored the effects of e-cigarette vapor on bacterial resistance to host innate immune killing mechanisms and the ability to cause pneumonia in mice. The study found that MRSA exposed to e-cigarette vapor became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls, and that the increased resistance persisted for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be inherited. The study also observed that the increased resistance made the bacteria more aggressive, particularly in laboratory cultures, where MRSA divided about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions.\n\nBoth studies highlight the complex interplay between cigarette smoke and MRSA, with the former serving as a potent alarm to the bacteria, triggering its activation of its defenses. The findings suggest that cigarette smoke may exacerbate the virulence of MRSA by promoting the growth and survival of resistant strains within the population, potentially leading to increased hospitalizations and mortality rates among patients with MRSA-related infections.\n\nThe study's findings raise questions about the potential causal relationship between smoking and antibiotic resistance, as well as the implications for public health policies aimed at reducing the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections. The study suggests that烟民是更易感染细菌的群体, and that the combination of cigarette smoke exposure and antibiotic resistance may contribute to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of the bacteria.

The study used Google's PageRank algorithm to determine the importance of historical figures on Wikipedia, finding that most important figures are born in western countries after the 17th century and are male. However, the study also revealed that each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, leading to a bias towards local figures. The researchers applied a second way of measuring importance, CheiRank, which measures the PageRank of an article based on the number of incoming and outgoing links, while the CheiRank of an article is proportional to the number of outgoing links. The result was that the world's most influential mind was Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, beating out everyone, including the Pope, President Obama, Frank Sinatra, Hitler, Caesar, and Jesus. The study suggests that the internet archive can help fix broken links on the web by preserving references to archived pages and putting them in place of broken links or companion links.

Since January 1, 2016, the CDC has confirmed 50 cases of AFM in 24 states, compared to just 21 cases in 2015. The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to viral infections, such as enteroviruses, which are common and can cause mild illnesses in children. When enteroviruses enter the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain, leading to paralysis. The symptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The best way to prevent AFM is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM. The incidence of AFM has increased significantly since 2014, coinciding with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68. The CDC has issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing. As of November 13, 2014, 88 cases had been reported in 32 states, with a median age of 7.6 years and 54% of cases being males. The median duration of illness was 25 days, and 65% of cases had cranial nerve motor dysfunction. Six (7%) patients had altered mental status, and three (3%) had seizures.

The shroud, which is currently displayed in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, has been radiocarbon dated to between 1260 and 1390 CE, making it a likely candidate for the crucifixion of Jesus. The researchers, led by Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, used real and synthetic blood samples to analyze the bloodstains on the left-hand side of the cloth, comparing them to the images of a standing model versus a crucified man or a face-down corpse. The results showed that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any single pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprints the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The investigators also tested the flow of blood on the left-hand side of the cloth, finding that the bloodstains appeared to be a mess, with trickles on the back of the hand and flow along the arm occurring at two completely different angles. The researchers concluded that the bloodstains are not consistent with the image of a crucified man or a face-down corpse, further supporting the idea that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The investigation has sparked renewed interest in the shroud's authenticity, with some experts calling for additional studies to determine the true nature of the cloth and its origins. The findings of the bloodstain pattern analysis have been published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, raising questions about the accuracy of the shroud's depiction of the crucifixion and the possibility of alternative explanations for its appearance.

Davis' second pregnancy occurred in 1996, during which she took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors initially told her didn't warrant concern. However, a later exam revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides, making it a medical necessity to terminate the pregnancy. Davis sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind, and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery. Despite the risks, Davis ultimately decided to terminate the pregnancy, citing the baby's suffering and the potential for complications. The memoir also covers Davis' previous pregnancies, including an ectopic pregnancy in 1994, where an embryo implants outside the uterus, and the termination of the ectopic pregnancy in 1996, which was considered medically necessary. Davis' filibuster in June 2013 set off a chaotic scene in the Texas Capitol that extended past midnight, with thousands of people watching it online. The memoir details Davis' experience and the challenges she faced in navigating the abortion debate in Texas, including the opposition from anti-abortion groups and the need to balance her personal story with the broader issue of reproductive rights. Davis' memoir is expected to be a significant factor in her campaign against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to replace Republican Gov. Rick Perry next year. Abbott's campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Davis' memoir is being published as she trails in the polls behind Abbott, who is favored at a time when Democrats haven't elected anyone to statewide office in two decades. The book's title comes from a Lady Bird Johnson quote: \"Become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid.\" Abortion rights have been a major undercurrent in the race for governor between the Fort Worth Democrat and Abbott, a staunch abortion opponent.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

{"pred": "Seattle's new sugary drink tax, which was introduced in 2018, has had a significant impact on the city's economy and residents' purchasing habits. The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold, making it more expensive for consumers. The tax applies to soda, sports drinks, kombucha, and other sugary beverages that don't list milk as their first ingredient. The tax has led to a decrease in sales of these products, especially at Costco, which saw a 34% decline in sales of beverages affected by the tax. The tax also impacted local businesses, with some retailers experiencing higher prices and decreased sales. The tax has also generated legal challenges, including a lawsuit against the city to get the tax thrown out and a request for a restraining order to prevent the tax from being imposed. Despite these challenges, the tax has been successful in discouraging people from drinking soda, which has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. However, the tax has also raised concerns about its potential impact on local businesses and the potential loss of revenue for the city's coffers. The tax's goal was to improve the health and lives of residents by encouraging them to consume fewer sugary beverages, but the reality is that the tax has failed to achieve this goal. Instead, it has resulted in a decrease in sales and reduced revenue for local businesses, which could have negative consequences for the city's economy. Additionally, the tax has generated legal challenges and concerns about its effectiveness in achieving its intended goals. Overall, the new sugary drink tax in Seattle has had mixed results, highlighting the challenges faced by municipalities implementing taxes aimed at promoting healthier behaviors and reducing the consumption of sugary beverages.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Pregnant women who reported taking acetaminophen for 20 weeks or more had a 50% increased risk for receiving ADHD medication compared to those who did not take the drug.

The spacecraft will travel to within 4 million miles of the sun's surface, the closest point to the sun, during its seven-year mission. The Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from the intense heat and radiation of the sun. The spacecraft will also have a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to keep the science instruments at room temperature. The Parker Solar Probe will conduct a series of flybys of Venus, which will allow it to observe the solar wind and its impact on the Earth's magnetic field. The mission aims to trace the energy behind solar wind, understand the heating of the solar corona, and determine the acceleration mechanism of the solar wind. The Parker Solar Probe will also study the solar wind's origins and its interaction with the Earth's magnetic field, which is essential for understanding the solar system's evolution and interactions with other celestial bodies.

The incident was caused by a type of malware called \"memory scraping\" that was installed in Target's point-of-sale (POS) systems. The malware triggered a \"hook\" that started sucking up information on transactions in the memory of the POS system or the server that controlled it. This allowed the attackers to steal credit and debit card data without requiring physical access to the stores. The attack was carried out by criminal groups in Eastern Europe, using software capabilities that allowed them to bypass network controls and conventional forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers. The report from iSight, a computer firm hired by the US Secret Service, provided new insights into the attack, revealing that the malware was able to operate covertly and subvert network controls. The report concluded that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cybercrooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach in the future. The holiday data breach was part of a broader and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers, which included Target, Neiman Marcus, and other businesses. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and private investigators are currently conducting an investigation into the attack, and the report suggests that the source of the attack may have been a combination of criminal groups in Eastern Europe and Brazilian cybercriminals. The report also notes that the attack was likely carried out over a period of several months, and that the perpetrators may have been able to evade detection for a long time due to their ability to operate covertly and subvert network controls.

The new planet, estimated to be between five and ten times the mass of Earth, orbits beyond Neptune's path and has not been directly observed. The researchers behind the discovery, Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have used mathematical and computer modeling to establish its existence based on the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. They predict that Planet Nine could have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational forces of Jupiter or Saturn, and its existence challenges the traditional definition of a planet as a celestial body that has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked debates about Pluto's status, with some arguing for its reinstatement as a planet and others advocating for its demotion due to its recent demotion. However, Brown and Batygin maintain that the IAU's decision to classify Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006 was a necessary step to address the inconsistencies in the solar system's definition. They argue that Planet Nine's presence challenges the notion that Pluto is the only planet in the solar system with a distinct orbit and that it could potentially play a crucial role in shaping the orbits of other objects in the outer solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also raised concerns about the impact of its existence on the solar system's habitability. Brown and Batygin assert that Planet Nine's presence could cause perturbations in the orbits of nearby dwarf planets, leading to changes in their orbits and potentially disrupting their orbits around the sun. They predict that Planet Nine's gravitational influence could alter the orbits of other objects in the outer solar system, potentially causing them to deviate from their expected paths and potentially impacting their ability to receive sufficient sunlight for life.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding the discovery of Planet Nine, the debate over its classification as a planet remains ongoing. Some experts argue that Planet Nine's existence challenges the traditional definition of a planet and that it should be considered a separate entity from Pluto. Others argue that Planet Nine's presence could have implications for the stability of the solar system and the potential for habitable environments in the outer solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life in the future.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

The study involved 9,509 men and women with stable CAD, monitoring their weight over an average of 12 visits. The median body weight variation over the period was 3.8 pounds per visit, and the researchers adjusted for various risk factors before analyzing the relationship between weight fluctuations and adverse outcomes.\n\nThe study found that individuals with the highest body weight variability had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability. The researchers attributed this difference to the accumulation of plaque in the coronary arteries, which narrows the blood flow to the heart and increases the risk of a heart attack.

{"pred": "The National Weather Service, led by meteorologist Robert Ricks, faced a critical decision on August 28, 2005, when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Ricks was tasked with issuing a warning message to residents in the affected area, emphasizing the severity of the impending storm and its potential catastrophic effects. To convey the urgency, Ricks created a bold and impactful statement, known as the \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE,\" which warned of a powerful hurricane with unprecedented strength and predicted widespread destruction, including roof and wall failure, native tree loss, and water shortages. The message was disseminated through various media outlets, including NBC News headquarters in New York and across the United States, and was accompanied by a rosary from Ricks' grandmother.\n\nRicks' document, which was later published in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, contained detailed predictions of the storm's impact, including the possibility of entire neighborhoods being uninhabitable for weeks or even months. The warnings were based on extensive research and analysis of historical data, highlighting the devastating consequences of hurricanes in the past.\n\nThe storm arrived on August 29, and Ricks and his colleagues worked tirelessly to prepare for the worst-case scenario. They gathered information from local experts, validated each prediction, and took steps to ensure that the warning message was accurate and actionable. Despite the emotional toll of witnessing the destruction firsthand, Ricks remained committed to delivering the necessary information to help residents prepare for the storm.\n\nAs the storm approached, Williams, a journalist covering the event, asked Ricks if he wanted to be wrong in his statement. Ricks acknowledged that he would prefer not to be wrong but emphasized the importance of providing accurate information to protect lives and communities. He stated that his team had done their best to gather and validate the predictions, and he believed that the warning message was crucial in helping people understand the severity of the situation.\n\nThe response to the warning message was initially met with disappointment, as some residents were hesitant to evacuate due to concerns about the potential damage to their homes. However, as the storm continued to intensify, the response shifted to a sense of urgency and preparedness. Many residents began evacuating, and the National Guard and emergency responders worked tirelessly to provide assistance and support to those impacted by the storm.\n\nDespite the challenges and emotional toll of the event, Ricks and his colleagues played a vital role in communicating the urgency of the situation and ensuring that residents were equipped to handle the aftermath.

This is a significant shift from the traditional perception that colorectal cancer is a disease primarily affecting older men. The study estimates that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50, making up a quarter of the total colorectal cancer population. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively. According to the study, younger patients tend to have more aggressive treatment options, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, compared to older patients. The study also found that younger patients with tumors that have metastasized to other organs were more likely to receive aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy, than older patients. The study highlights the importance of improving risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults, particularly those under 50, as the number of younger colorectal cancer patients is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The study recommends that doctors should be on the lookout for warning signs of colon cancer, such as bright red bleeding with a bowel movement, and refer those of concern to a gastroenterologist for a diagnostic workup. The study concludes that changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would potentially prevent more cancer deaths, but further research is needed to determine the optimal age for screening.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

{"pred": "The three-step process for dominating the universe involves harvesting all of a planet's resources, all of a nearby star's energy, and all the energy from all the stars in a local galaxy. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev first proposed these three phases of galactic expansion in 1962 as a way to measure the energy consumption of increasingly powerful societies. A recent paper posted on the preprint journal arXiv.org has revived Kardashev's model and added a new, apocalyptic twist, suggesting that any sufficiently advanced civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will expand throughout the universe, attempting to secure as many stars as possible before they become permanently inaccessible due to the encroaching horizon caused by dark energy. To capture stars from other galaxies, scientists propose using a swarm of satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" which would create a spherical shell around a star and harness its energy. The satellites would be made of satellites, such as solar-powered ones, and would be capable of maintaining their position in space through gravitational balance. The satellites would not be in orbit, but instead hover in space, forming a \"statite\" ring around the star. The satellite would collect the star's energy and beam it back to the home planet, where it could be used to accelerate the entire ball of fire back toward the planet that wanted to use it. The paper suggests that this approach could potentially lead to the discovery of advanced alien civilizations that are thousands, or even millions, of years older than humanity, and that they may already be well into their Level III, star-harvesting phase. The paper also proposes that the spectrum of starlight from a galaxy that has had its useful stars harvested by an advanced civilization would be dominated by massive stars and peak at longer wavelengths than otherwise would have been the case, making it easier for alien star harvesting to be detected.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The decision comes despite concerns from local and international news media, who have raised questions about the safety of the water for Portland water customers. The main issue being debated is whether the water should be drained to ensure no health risks to the city's water supply. The Water Bureau's decision is based on the fact that the average adult human bladder can hold two or three cups of urine, and the possibility of someone getting sick due to the man's urine is minimal. However, the Water Bureau officials argue that any risk is too great, especially considering the potential for the water to contain microorganisms and other contaminants. The Water Bureau is currently working with the Multnomah County District Attorney to determine if there are criminal charges to be filed against the man. The incident has sparked a debate about the role of politics in the decision-making process, with some arguing that the Water Bureau should follow the recommendations of experts and prioritize public health over short-term political gains. The controversy surrounding the disposal of the water has also led to increased scrutiny of the city's open-air reservoir system, which must be disconnected from the city water system by the end of 2015. The Mt. Tabor Reservoir system is home to three of the city's five uncovered drinking water reservoirs, and a handful of excellent hill runs. The Water Bureau has stated that it will dump a total of 38 million gallons of water, even though test results show no signs of water contamination. The incident has caused concern among residents and environmentalists alike, who have called for greater transparency and accountability in the handling of public water supplies.", "answers": ["The Portland teen accused of peeing in a city reservoir on Wednesday insists he didn't do it—in a relatively NSFW defense. \"Yeah, it's f---ing retarded, dude,\" 18-year-old Dallas Swonger tells Vocativ in what the site calls an \"expletive-filled interview\" given as Swonger smoked a Newport cigarette. \"I didn't piss in the f---ing water.\" He explains that he did urinate, after a night of skateboarding at Mount Tabor Park, but he did so against the wall of the reservoir, not into the reservoir. \"I was like, 'Dudes I have to piss so bad.'

The show was initially launched in 1996 as a mockumentary-style news show, featuring humorous headlines and interviews with guests. The show's format was designed to poke fun at traditional news coverage, often incorporating elements of satire and parody.\n\nDuring the Kilborn era, The Daily Show shifted its focus from creating news to making light of it, with Stewart pushing for a more pointed and serious approach to political comedy. This shift led to a change in the show's content, with Stewart and his team focusing on issues such as the Iraq War, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and the 2000 presidential election.\n\nIn 1999, Jon Stewart took over as host, and the show underwent significant changes, including a new lineup of correspondents and a new format that emphasized humor and wit over straightforward news reporting. One notable change was the introduction of a new correspondent named Vance DeGeneres, who brought a fresh perspective to the show and helped to establish a more diverse and irreverent tone.\n\nAs the show continued to evolve, tensions arose between Stewart and his colleagues, particularly with the departure of Kilborn writers and the subsequent hiring of new writers and correspondents. This led to a period of conflict and controversy, culminating in a \"fuck-you meeting\" that aired on Comedy Central in 2000, in which Stewart accused his colleagues of being insensitive and lacking a sense of humor.\n\nDespite these challenges, The Daily Show remained a beloved and influential show, with a dedicated fan base and a loyal following among audiences.

The oldest tools, consisting mainly of hand axes, were shaped like tear drops with rounded ends and pointed eyes, indicating a focus on cutting and processing plant material. The next technological revolution, marked by the emergence of Middle Stone Age implements, occurred tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought, suggesting that early humans began developing it even earlier than previously thought. The team of international scientists found that the Middle Stone Age tools were made from obsidian that originated far from Olorgesailie, while the pigment lumps, including two pieces with grinding marks, were from an undetermined distance outside the Olorgesailie vicinity. The team's findings challenge the traditional view that modernity arose outside of Africa and provide evidence of the early development of complex behaviors and communication in early human societies. The Middle Stone Age tools and pigment lumps suggest that early humans were adapting to changing environments, forming social networks, and exchanging raw materials, which laid the foundation for the emergence of modern human cognition and language.

He also criticized Morning Joe co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, calling their tweets \"beneath the dignity\" of the presidential office.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to become \"so presidential\" that he would eventually return as a presidential person, but his tweets have consistently raised questions about his ability to govern effectively and maintain a level of decorum on the platform. Some Republican senators, including Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, have expressed concerns about Trump's Twitter habit, arguing that his tweets may undermine public trust in the presidency.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump continued to attack the media, tweeting that he doesn't want to act presidential \"quite yet,\" but he plans to become \"so presidential\" in the future. He also suggested that he might use Twitter to engage with voters directly, rather than relying solely on traditional media outlets.\n\nSome of Trump's tweets have been particularly controversial, with critics pointing out instances of racism, sexism, and misinformation. For example, his tweet regarding the 2007 WWE incident, in which he body-slammed and repeatedly punched WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, received widespread condemnation for its appropriateness and lack of context.\n\nIn addition to his tweets, Trump has also faced criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many expressing concern about the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories related to the virus.

The airline is also launching push notifications for passengers who have the airline's mobile app, which will inform them when boarding has started and give them a tool to manage their boarding group. The new boarding process aims to address overcrowding at gates, which has become an unwelcome side effect of full flights. The airline expects the new system to reduce travel times and drive economic benefits for consumers and communities. The new system is part of a broader effort to streamline its operations and improve the customer experience, including the integration of its complementary route networks into a collaborative revenue-sharing JBA with Copa, Aerovías del Continente Americano S.A.

Sizemore declined to address the situation, stating that his position is \"no comment.\" The film's producers, Jai Stefan, Michael Manshel, and Gus Spoliansky, removed Sizemore from the set as soon as they heard about the assertion, reviewed the photographs from the portrait session but found them to be inconclusive, and sought out the parents to encourage them to engage law enforcement if they felt compelled to do so.

The goal of this project is to replace broken links with archived versions of the original pages, ensuring that users have access to the content they were intended to find.\n\nThe Internet Archive has identified a number of \"No More 404\" sites, which are websites that do not exist anymore but still contain valuable information or resources. These sites often have outdated or missing links that prevent users from accessing the content they were looking for. By archiving these pages, the Internet Archive hopes to provide a permanent record of their existence and make it easier for users to find them again in the future.\n\nTo achieve this, the Internet Archive is conducting regular crawls of supported \"No More 404\" sites. These crawls involve visiting each site and identifying any pages that are no longer available or have been moved to a different location. Once identified, the Internet Archive captures the URL of each page and saves it in its database. This allows the organization to easily identify and preserve the pages that are being referenced in other parts of the web.\n\nIn addition to archiving pages, the Internet Archive is also working to create companion links for these archived pages. Companion links are links that point to the original page on the web, allowing users to see what was originally intended by the page's authors.

The ocean, which is composed of water containing both ordinary hydrogen and deuterium, was discovered by analyzing the water vapor that lingered in the Martian atmosphere. The water vapor contains the same proportions of hydrogen and deuterium as Earth's water, but on Mars, the ordinary hydrogen has been leaking into outer space due to the planet's weaker gravity. The team of scientists calculated that the average depth of the ocean on Mars is around 450 feet (137 meters), which is significantly lower than the 137 meters reported earlier. The ocean would have been sufficient to cover the entire planet evenly, but it probably would have formed an ocean in the northern hemisphere, which has a consistently lower altitude. The evidence suggests that Mars was once far wetter and warmer than it is today, with much of it being in liquid form rather than in the icy polar caps where it's now locked up. The discovery of the ancient ocean provides new insights into the early history of Mars and supports the possibility of life on the planet. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the chemical composition of the Martian atmosphere to accurately predict the amount of water that may have been present on the planet during its early history.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The film's plot revolves around the con man's expertise in picking pockets and his partnership with Jess, who becomes his apprentice and learns the art of conning.\n\nThe article highlights the casting choices for the film, with Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck initially considered for the role of the con man, but ultimately settling on Will Smith. The article notes that Smith's portrayal of Nicky is described as confident and authoritative, with a distinct smile and stoic demeanor. The article also mentions that Smith's previous films, such as Independence Day, I Am Legend, Hancock, and After Earth, have required him to maintain a cool and stoic exterior, but in \"Focus,\" he is allowed to showcase his charm and wit.\n\nThe article discusses the film's premise, which involves a con game that involves a wealthy businessman betting with Nicky and Jess, and the subsequent revelation that the businessman is actually a con artist.

The deal, if approved by regulators and shareholders, would result in the creation of a new entity with 14 stock and futures exchanges and five clearing operations, serving as intermediaries between buyers and sellers of futures and other contracts. This move marks a significant shift in the global market for derivatives, with ICE's focus on commodities such as oil, natural gas, and cotton, compared to the dominance of the CME Group, which controls the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. The acquisition is seen as a response to the Justice Department's opposition to the proposed merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, which would have created a dominant player in the trading of stocks and derivatives. The deal is expected to be announced as early as Thursday morning, although negotiations may still fail. The potential merger would significantly expand ICE's market value, making it a larger company with a smaller workforce of around 1,000 employees compared to NYSE Euronext, which has 3,077 employees. The acquisition is also expected to pave the way for electronic trading, which has disrupted traditional floor trading and has led to increased competition among exchanges. The deal is seen as a win for investors, as it will provide access to a wider range of products and services, and potentially lower costs for both buyers and sellers. However, there are concerns about the impact of the acquisition on other exchanges, particularly those with nationalist concerns, such as the Hong Kong and Singaporean exchanges.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer model that matches features of YouTube videos, such as colors, shapes, and movements, with patterns of brain activity. By analyzing brain activity during YouTube viewing sessions, the team was able to reconstruct the videos as blurry, dreamlike reconstructions of the actual videos. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize the field of neuroscience, offering insights into our dreams, memories, and even fantasies.\n\nThe study involved participants who watched two sets of movie trailers for two hours at a time, using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine to record the amount of blood flowing through the visual cortex, the part of the brain responsible for processing visual information. The MRI machine identified patterns of brain activity associated with dynamic visual experiences, such as shapes, images, and sounds, against 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos.\n\nTo reconstruct the videos, the researchers developed a computer model that matched the features of the videos with patterns of brain activity. Once the model was built, the team ran it backward through the model to try to uncover what the viewer saw. Subtle changes in blood flow to visual areas of the brain, measured by functional MRI, predicted what was on the screen at the time, including scenes from Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau or an airplane.\n\nThe reconstructed videos are blurry because they layer all the YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity pattern. However, the researchers believe that the technology could one day be used to broadcast imagery, such as scenes that play out inside our minds independent from vision. They envision applications in fields like broadcasting imagery for people with paralysis, controlling environments by imagining sequences of movements, and even monitoring criminal activities.\n\nWhile the potential uses of this technology are promising, the researchers caution that the technology is still in its early stages and requires further development before it can be used in practical applications. They emphasize the importance of understanding how the brain works in naturalistic conditions, particularly when it comes to interpreting abstract visual experiences that are similar to dreams or memories.\n\nOverall, the findings of these studies highlight the potential of brain-computer interfaces to revolutionize the way we perceive and interact with the world around us.

The gun charge stems from a search of Durst's room on March 14, 2015, which turned up a flesh-colored latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair, five ounces of marijuana, more than $100,000 in cash, and a loaded Smith and Wesson .38-caliber revolver.

The third supermoon, which occurred on January 31, 2018, will be visible from Australia, with totality beginning at 11:30 am UTC. The Virtual Telescope Project, along with other partners, will broadcast a live virtual lunar eclipse session on January 31, 2018, showcasing the stunning beauty of this unique event. The Super Blue Blood-Moon 2018 will be the first total eclipse of a Blue Moon in nearly 152 years, and it will be visible from Hawaii, Alaska, and parts of Canada. The eclipse will be accompanied by a total lunar eclipse, with totality visible from eastern Asia across the Pacific to western North America. The best time to enjoy both supermoon and lunar eclipse is right after moonrise and before sunrise, when the moon is sitting on the horizon. However, if it's too cloudy or too cold to go outside, there are options to beam either celestial event straight to your living room. The Virtual Telescope Project provides a livestream of the Jan. 1 supermoon rise over Rome's skyline, beginning at 4:00 pm UTC, and the Jan. 31 eclipse from Australia, beginning at 11:30 am UTC. For photography, a smartphone can be used to take a picture of the supermoon or lunar eclipse with a finger held in place to lock the camera's focus. Adjusting the exposure slider can help achieve the right balance of light for your shot.

For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.

The FBI has stated that the attack is part of a broader effort by foreign and domestic actors to manipulate elections through the use of cyber tools, including social media and targeted online advertising.\n\nBob Lord, the chief security officer for the DNC, emphasized the importance of maintaining vigilance in light of the increasing number of vulnerabilities in election systems. He highlighted the vulnerability of the voter registration system, which is used in 50 states, as well as the inner workings of the parties, making them susceptible to manipulation. Lord called the voter file \"the party's most sensitive information,\" underscoring the gravity of the situation.\n\nRob Joyce, the White House cybersecurity coordinator until his removal, echoed Lord's concerns about the changing nature of elections due to the increased reliance on digital platforms. He warned that the focus from traditional hacking to stealing secrets has shifted towards manipulating data and imposing national power.

The agency's findings suggest that the threat landscape has evolved significantly, with foreign actors increasingly leveraging digital tools to influence public opinion and disrupt electoral processes.

The latest report by the University of Washington-Seattle's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation shows that obesity rates are rising across the globe, with the highest rates occurring in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands. The study covers 188 nations from 1980 to 2013 and reveals that obesity rates have increased by 28% in adults and 47% in children during the 33-year period studied. The US, which claims less than 5% of its population, accounts for the largest chunk of the planet's obese population, with 13% of adults and 65% of adult women being obese. The study also highlights the impact of obesity on various health risks, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and chronic complications that lead to millions of deaths each year. The researchers found that obesity is a complex problem that affects people of all ages, incomes, and regions, with not one country successfully reducing its obesity rate. The problem is particularly acute in the Middle East and North Africa, where obesity rates have risen by 58% in adult men and 65% in adult women. The study suggests that obesity is appearing at increasing young ages, with the rate of increase in adult obesity slowing in the past eight years. The US, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia account for more than half of the world's obese people, with the US leading the way with 13% of adults and 65% of adult women being obese. The report emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing obesity, including changes in diet composition, physical activity, and access to healthy foods, as well as addressing social and economic factors that contribute to obesity. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and propose solutions, with a report expected in early 2015. The study underscores the urgent need for action to address the obesity epidemic and reduce the burden of chronic diseases associated with obesity.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

The letter, according to sources close to the couple, was intended to express his love and concern for Holmes, acknowledging her departure from his life. The letter was sent in March, but it was not successful due to the fact that it was too soon for Holmes to be receptive to the message. However, the letter has reportedly had a positive impact on Holmes, as she has been genuinely touched by the gesture and has expressed gratitude for the letter.\n\nPassage 3 focuses on the history of Alexa Internet, a company that has donated its crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996.

The final nine governorates have also been allocated seats, with the Brotherhood's strongholds of Gharbiya and Daqahliyya in the Delta receiving significant support.

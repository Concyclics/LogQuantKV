After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kalashnikov became disillusioned with the country's authoritarian government and sought solace in religion.\n\nIn 1996, Kalashnikov donated his archive of crawl data to the Internet Archive, which adds it to the Wayback Machine upon an embargo period. This donation highlights the importance of preserving historical records and serves as a testament to the impact of the AK-47 on modern warfare and political conflicts.\n\nIn 2012, Kalashnikov wrote a long emotional letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, expressing his deep spiritual pain over the numerous deaths caused by the AK-47. He believed that the longer he lived, the more he pondered the question of whether he was morally responsible for the lives taken by the weapon, despite the fact that it was designed to defend his country.\n\nThe letter was published in Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin newspaper, and was later republished in the Russian Orthodox Church's official publication, the Izvestia. The document shows that Kalashnikov's desire for spiritual pain and guilt over the deaths of innocent people led him to seek solace in the Church, which he considered a source of comfort and guidance.\n\nIn 2009, Kalashnikov attended the Russian Orthodox Church's celebration of his 90th birthday, marking a turning point in his life. The event was attended by President Vladimir Putin, who expressed his support for the Russian Orthodox Church and the AK-47, stating that it served as a symbol of defense for the Fatherland.\n\nThroughout his life, Kalashnikov faced criticism for his refusal to take responsibility for the deaths of countless people, attributing them to the policies of other countries acquiring the AK-47. He also expressed concern about the use of the weapon by criminals and child soldiers, emphasizing the need for a clear distinction between military forces and terrorist groups.\n\nThe article concludes with Kalashnikov's passing in 2019, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and a profound sense of guilt over the lives lost due to the AK-47's widespread adoption.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability.

Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

Schwarzenegger's hosting debut was not enough to save the show, as ABC's \"Celebrity Apprentice\" premiered with a larger audience of 6.6 million viewers, while CBS' \"The Bachelor\" program also performed well, averaging 6.6 million viewers. Despite the initial hype surrounding Schwarzenegger's hosting debut, the ratings were lower than those of his predecessor, with the show averaging only 7.6 million viewers in the first episode. The ratings for the key demographic (viewers aged 18 to 49) were also lower than expected, with the average rating for the Apprentice's premiere being 46%. The network struggled to overcome the lack of sports programming and the controversy surrounding the Trump-hosted show, leading to a disappointing start to the new season. However, the show's new host, Arnold Schwarzenegger, attempted to make up for the ratings loss by promoting the upcoming \"Celebrity Apprentice\" series, which faced competition from other shows like \"The Bachelor.\" The Wall, a new NBC show, retained most of the Apprentice's viewership, contributing to the overall ratings. Overall, the ratings for the \"The Apprentice\" premiere were below expectations, with Schwarzenegger's hosting debut failing to attract a significant audience. The network's efforts to promote the show and overcome the sports and political controversies may have contributed to the lower ratings, but the show's performance was not strong enough to overcome the challenges presented by the new host and the competition from other shows.", "answers": ["Arnold Schwarzenegger seems to think Donald Trump needs a lesson in making friends after the president-elect chose to criticize his Celebrity Apprentice successor. \"Wow, the ratings are in and [new host] Arnold Schwarzenegger got 'swamped' (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT,\" Trump tweeted Friday after the Trump-less show premiered Monday to 4.9 million viewers, according to Nielsen.

The cloth, which is 14 feet long, 3.5 feet wide, and kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case, has been scrutinized for years due to its controversial status. Radiocarbon dating determined its origin to be between 1260 and 1390 CE, making it a likely candidate for a crucifixion site. However, the researchers found that the bloodstains on the cloth are inconsistent with each other, suggesting that it may not be a genuine crucifixion site. The researchers used a living subject and a mannequin to analyze the flow of blood on wounds on the left hand, the forearm, the \"lance\" of the Shroud, and the lower back. They observed that the bloodstains on the Shroud of Turin are not consistent with any one pose, indicating that it is a fake. The researchers also tested the bloodstains on the Shroud with real and synthetic blood samples, finding that the former is inconsistent with the latter. The researchers concluded that the cloth is a mix of human blood and a mixture of pigments, which suggests that it is a medieval forgery. The researchers also found that the bloodstains on the Shroud of Turin do not match the actual bloodstains found on the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ, raising doubts about its authenticity.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The MNLA, which is primarily composed of Tuareg rebels, aims to establish an independent state called Azawad within the northern part of Mali, with the goal of protecting the country's cultural heritage and preserving its unity. The coup has caused widespread concern among West African leaders, who are attempting to respond promptly and diplomatically to ensure the withdrawal of the MNLA and the restoration of constitutional order. The international community has also expressed its solidarity with the West African governments, demanding the MNLA to step down and hand over power to a transitional body.

The Tuareg rebels, who have taken control of the northern part of Mali, have disrupted the flow of goods and services, causing fuel shortages and disrupting the functioning of the country's infrastructure.

The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\" It wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously. As for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame? \"If you're fat you're fat,\" she once said. \"I hate this modern-day political correctness, that you don't call things by their proper name.\" Her agent remembers Wright similarly in a statement: \"Loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, Clarissa was utterly non-PC and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost.\" There's no word on Wright's cause of death, but the Guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2870}

They instead used Mr Wilson's smartphone to find a route down, leading them across the mountain's west face. However, Mrs. Wilson fell 30 feet (9 meters) down a vertical cliff, resulting in a fatal injury.

{"pred": "Seattle's new $1.75-cent-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages has sparked controversy and debate among residents and businesses alike. The tax was introduced in 2017 to encourage healthier choices and reduce sugar intake, but it has led to a hike in prices and decreased sales at major retailers like Costco. The Seattle City Council ultimately approved the tax, but it has faced criticism from some who argue that it targets low-income communities and disproportionately affects healthy foods. The tax applies to beverages that list milk as their first ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages, and is set to rise to $26.33 per ounce. The tax has also impacted Seattle's beverage industry, with many companies struggling to compete with higher prices and reduced sales. The tax is expected to generate revenue for Seattle, but it could also have negative consequences for local businesses and contribute to economic hardship. The tax is seen as a potential solution to address obesity and diabetes, but it has faced resistance from the beverage industry and opponents who argue that it is regressive and fails to address the root causes of these conditions. The tax is also causing concern among retailers who fear increased congestion and lost sales, especially in the long-term. Despite the controversy, Seattle's tax on sweetened beverages is expected to generate revenue for the city, but it remains to be seen whether it will have a positive impact on public health and reduce obesity rates.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The study analyzed data from the Danish National Birth Cohort Study, which tracked the health of over 64,000 children born between 1996 and 2002. The researchers found that women who took acetaminophen more frequently during pregnancy were more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD, a rare form of the disorder, and a less common condition called hyperkinetic disorder.

House Republicans have proposed a plan to delay the health law, which includes a repeal of the law's tax on medical devices, and a one-year extension of the law. Senate Democrats have rejected the proposal, arguing that it would harm the health care system and the country's credit rating. The Senate has refused to consider a short-term funding bill for the ACA, leaving the door open for a government shutdown. The potential shutdown could have significant consequences for the Washington region, including job losses, reduced federal services, and a potential impact on tourism and the economy. The White House and congressional Democrats are expected to push for a compromise, but the Senate is likely to reject the proposal. The potential shutdown could happen for the first time since the 1990s, and it could have a significant impact on the economy, particularly in the Washington region, where the federal government accounts for one-third of the economy. The shutdown could result in a large-scale disruption of federal services, including the closure of federal agencies, the suspension of federal services, and the potential loss of billions of dollars in federal payroll, healthcare benefits, and other federal services. The potential shutdown could also have a significant impact on the economy, with the potential for widespread job losses, reduced government services, and a decline in the public's trust in government. The White House and congressional Democrats are expected to push for a compromise to keep the government funded without any major changes to the health care law, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have stated that they will not accept any changes to the health care law or the tax on medical devices. The potential shutdown could have severe consequences for the Democratic Party, with the possibility of losing control of the House and damaging the party's image in the eyes of voters.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The attack was carried out by a sophisticated group of cybercriminals using a type of malware that allowed them to infiltrate Target's point-of-sale (POS) systems and steal data without detection. The malware was able to bypass security measures and steal data from transactions made during the holiday season, which may have impacted holiday sales and raised concerns about the potential for future breaches.\n\nThe report from a computer firm hired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) detailed the types of software used in the attack, including a sophisticated malware program called \"ransomware,\" which was capable of stealing data from Target's point-of-sale systems. The malware was able to start by placing a piece of code in the POS system that triggered a series of actions, including stealing data from transactions, encrypting the data, and then transferring it to a remote server controlled by the attackers.\n\nThe report also revealed that the malware was executed covertly, using a technique known as \"memory scraping,\" which allowed the attackers to bypass traditional security measures and gain access to Target's networks. The malware was able to extract data from Target's point-of-sale systems, including credit and debit card transactions, and then move the data to a remote server controlled by the attackers.\n\nThe report concluded that the malware was developed and distributed by a group of cybercriminals operating in Eastern Europe, specifically in Russia and other countries with strong programming skills. The authors of the report stated that the malware was able to operate effectively due to the combination of software capabilities and the lack of traditional security measures in place at Target.\n\nThe report highlights the importance of ongoing efforts to prevent and respond to cyber threats, particularly in the context of holiday shopping season, when businesses rely heavily on online transactions.

The find was made during excavations of the medieval fortress site in Burgas, which date back to the 6th century AD. The reliquary, which is only 2.2 cm long and has a diameter of 1.7 cm, is decorated with crosses and has a similar image to other known lead tube reliquaries from Ephesus, suggesting that the reliquary may belong to the cult for St. John the Theologian (John the Apostle). The reliquary was likely created by a pilgrim from the Foros Peninsula (Cape) who visited Ephesus and returned with the holy treasure, which was later donated to the basilica on Foros. The reliquary is significant because it preserves the belief that John the Apostle had healing powers and is one of the most important discoveries in the history of the Burgas Regional Museum of History.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

{"pred": "The Detroit riots of 1967, a period of racial unrest in the city of Detroit, saw three Black men killed and numerous questions left unanswered. The film \"Detroit\" by Kathryn Bigelow, a British-American filmmaker, is a powerful and disturbing portrayal of the violence and injustice that occurred during that time. The film starts with a brief history lesson about the city's history of racial migrations and white flight, followed by the police response to the riots, which culminates in the deaths of three Black men. The film is set against the backdrop of the Detroit riots, and Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal's script is criticized for its lack of depth and understanding of the people involved. The film is not a character study, but rather a situation-based one, with a focus on the aftermath of the shootings and the reactions of the police officers. The film's central antagonist, a racist officer named Krauss, is portrayed as remorseful and responsible for the deaths, leading to a central conflict between the police and the black community. The film's depiction of the Algiers Motel siege, where the police were acquitted, adds to the sense of injustice and anger, and the film's lack of a clear explanation of the events leaves many questions unanswered. The film's depiction of the violence and brutality of the police officers, including the use of excessive force, is graphic and disturbing, and the film's rating of R by the Motion Picture Association of America is a reminder of the ongoing issue of racial inequality in the United States. The film's opening scene, set against the backdrop of the riots, sets the tone for the rest of the movie, highlighting the violence and chaos that erupts in the city. The film's depiction of the police officers' actions, including the use of excessive force, is a stark reminder of the systemic racism and mistreatment of Black people in the United States. The film's title, \"Detroit,\" references the city's history of racial segregation and the violent response of the police to the riots, and the film's portrayal of the events is both informative and disturbing, leaving the viewer with a complex and nuanced understanding of the past and the present.", "answers": ["Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit tells the story of a black singer who takes refuge in a dingy motel to escape the 1967 Motor City riots.

But \"maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with Detroit is the point.\" Chris Klimek says Detroit is \"maddeningly imperfect but still honorable,\" citing \"lightly fictionalized\" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up \"for maximum outrage.\" This is \"messy work, even when it’s done in good faith,\" he writes at NPR.

The author, astrophysicist and senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, proposes that the presence of dark energy in the universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate, making it necessary to expand the universe to ensure that the remaining stars cannot be isolated from the rest of the universe. The author adds that advanced civilizations would recognize the existence of such a civilization through the unique light signature emitted by the galaxy, which would be dominated by massive stars and peak at longer wavelengths than normal stars. The article highlights the importance of capturing and harnessed energy from stars to power advanced civilizations, as well as the potential for advanced civilizations to exist thousands or even millions of years older than humanity, potentially using massive, spherical structures around their star to capture and store energy. The article also mentions the possibility of advanced civilizations utilizing massive, spherical structures to capture and store energy, as proposed by astrophysicist and senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in 1962. Additionally, the article discusses the challenges of detecting such structures in the light signature of a galaxy, including the difficulty of developing accurate instruments to detect the light from these structures, and the potential for these structures to be hidden in the deep reaches of the universe.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The Olorgesailie Basin was once a lush, grassland ecosystem, but over time, the landscape shifted to become a desert due to climate change. The Olorgesailie Basin is home to a variety of stone tools, including handaxes, which were shaped like tears and had rounded ends and a pointed end. The researchers believe that these tools were used for both foraging and hunting, and that the technology was well-established by 300,000 years ago. The team's findings challenge previous theories that modern humans emerged after a sudden transition to Middle Stone Age implements, and suggest that the technology was present before that point. The Olorgesailie Basin provides evidence of a gradual decline in the use of traditional stone tools and the emergence of more advanced, modern tools, such as the Acheulian and Middle Stone Age technologies. The team's research also reveals the first evidence of the exchange of pigments, including red and black, which suggests a complex culture and social networks. The Olorgesailie Basin is a crucial site in the development of early modern human societies, providing insights into the origins of complex behaviors and the exchange of knowledge and resources between different groups.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

This decision was met with criticism, particularly from Apple's CEO Phil Schiller, who stated that the company had \"courage\" to move on and create a new standard for audio cables. The Lightning connector allows for faster charging and better sound quality over a standard 3.5mm cable, but it also requires an iCloud account and is not compatible with all types of headphones. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus require an additional $9 $9 aux-to-Lightning cable dongle, which is considered \"stupidity\" by some users. Apple's decision to remove the 30-pin connector and build a new Lightning connector has caused a backlash, with some arguing that it makes the iPhone less portable and defeats the purpose of having a single cable for all devices. The company's response to this criticism is to charge customers for the Lightning connector, with some critics suggesting that it is a \"waste of money\" and \"not worth it.\" Overall, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus' lack of a standard 3.5mm aux cable has sparked controversy and debate among consumers and industry experts alike.", "answers": ["Apple presented its new smartphone Wednesday, and nestled in with the iPhone 7's much-ballyhooed features was the disclosure that the company is getting rid of the phone's headphone jack—news that wasn't exactly met with universal acclaim, or much acclaim at all.

{"pred": "The article reports on a groundbreaking medical procedure performed at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital to create a pair of ears for a nine-year-old boy named Kieran Sorkin, who was born without ears due to a rare condition called microtia. The procedure involved removing the rib cartilage from both sides of Kieran's body and shaping it into a framework for his ears. The surgeons used a template of Kieran's mother's ears as a guide, ensuring that the ear shapes closely resemble her own. The ear frameworks were then inserted into pockets in the skin, and the skin was sculpted to fit the contours of the new ear on both sides. The surgery was considered a cosmetic procedure, aimed at improving Kieran's confidence and self-esteem, rather than enhancing his hearing. The procedure involves harvesting the rib cartilage from the patient's own body and using it to create a new ear. The technique involves extracting cartilage from the patient's fat tissue and using it to grow a human-like ear structure. The procedure is currently being researched and developed at the Institute of Child Health in London, which aims to use stem cells from a patient's own fat tissue to create a human ear. The surgery is expected to offer a more personalized and less invasive approach compared to harvesting a child's rib cartilage. The procedure has shown great promise in boosting the confidence of children with microtia and improving their overall performance in school and social situations. The procedure is planned to be performed on a few hundred children per year, with most of them receiving one or both ears. The procedure is a relatively minor operation, but it has the potential to significantly enhance a child's confidence and alter their entire trajectory in life.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

The case highlights the importance of the habeas corpus clause in protecting individual liberties and the need for courts to consider the scientific validity of chimpanzee classification as legal persons.

Until now in the US, those who've used this legal tactic have been human. But a New York judge yesterday ruled that the writ may be used by two lab chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, Science magazine reports. NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

The study, led by Geronimo Villanueva at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, analyzed the Martian atmosphere using three of the world's most powerful infrared telescopes and found that the water vapor present in the Martian atmosphere contained both ordinary hydrogen and heavy deuterium. The study estimates that the planet's water had a high proportion of deuterium, with a concentration of seven times that of Earth's ocean, indicating a significant loss of water on Mars. The study suggests that the ancient ocean covering half of Mars may have been lost to space, leaving a much deeper ocean in the northern hemisphere, which could have supported life on the planet. The study also finds evidence of water on Mars for at least 1.5 billion years, suggesting that Mars was once much wetter and warmer than it is today. The study's findings add to the growing evidence of life on Mars, with the recent detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere by the Curiosity rover. The study's conclusion that Mars was once habitable, although not necessarily habitable, suggests that life could have emerged on Mars, potentially leading to the discovery of life on the planet.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The Luxembourg court had previously rejected Nestlé's appeal, stating that Nestlé had not presented sufficient evidence to prove that the shape was distinctive enough to warrant its registration as an EU trademark. The EUIPO will now consider the evidence and decide whether to protect the shape of the four-fingered wafer biscuits in all EU countries, not just in the UK, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal. This ruling could lead to a loss of the EU trademark for Kit Kat, but it also opens up opportunities for Nestlé to challenge the shape in future cases. The case highlights the importance of protecting trademarks in the context of multinational chocolate brands operating in the EU, where there are varying histories in national markets. The case has also been linked to debates surrounding Brexit, with some supporters arguing that the EU's \"diktat\" could spell the end of the Kit Kat brand. Additionally, the case has been replicated in the UK, where a dispute between the Luxembourg court and Mondelez over the color of the gold-wrapped Easter bunnies led to a 16,000-word ruling that Kit Kat's \"no inherent distinctiveness\" argument was insufficient.

{"pred": "The study published in the Journal of Evolution reveals that dinosaurs did not roar like the sounds associated with the iconic film \"Jurassic Park.\" Instead, the sounds made by dinosaurs were generated by a sound studio, not the fossil record. The study analyzed the sounds made by various bird and crocodile species, finding that a large number of birds, particularly those with large bodies, use closed-mouth vocalizations. These sounds are characterized by low, throaty whistles and hisses, which were developed by birds with proportionately large bodies. The study also found that the evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and crocodiles occurred independently at least 16 times, with only a small percentage of species having open-mouthed vocalizations. The study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouthed vocalization may have evolved from a combination of traits such as the presence of an esophageal pouch and a vocal organ similar to our larynxes, but two-pronged and lower in the chest. The study also highlights the importance of taking into account the sound-making process in creating realistic sounds in movies, and the need for sound designers to consider the unique characteristics of the sounds they create, such as the sound of a mother turtle's mating calls, which were inspired by the sounds of turtles in the movie \"Jurassic Park.\" The study concludes that understanding the sounds made by dinosaurs and their evolution can provide insights into the sounds made by modern birds and crocodiles, and the evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, used functional MRI scans to measure the brain activity of individuals while watching YouTube videos. The brain activity patterns were then used to train a computer model to recognize and reconstruct the corresponding videos, resulting in a continuous, abstract representation of the original videos. The model identified subtle changes in brain activity patterns that corresponded to specific visual elements, including shapes, movements, and color schemes. The researchers believe that this technology has the potential to reveal the contents of dreams, memories, and even the inner workings of the human mind, including the brain's various visual modules and the nature of memories. However, the technology's limitations lie in the fact that it only captures a fraction of the brain's complexity and requires large-scale computing power to process vast amounts of data. The researchers suggest that the technology could potentially be used in applications such as dream interpretation, court cases, and even controlling environments in paralyzed individuals. They argue that the accuracy of the technology's depiction of memories would depend on the nature of the data and the limitations imposed by the technology itself.

{"pred": "The article discusses the alarming trend of obesity, which affects millions of people worldwide, accounting for 2.1 billion people, or 13% of the global population, according to a new study published in the Lancet. The study, titled \"World Obesity Report,\" provides a comprehensive overview of obesity trends over the past three decades, revealing that obesity rates have risen across all regions, including the USA, where obesity rates exceed 5%, and even more in developing countries. The study highlights the increasing prevalence of obesity among men, women, and children, with women and children experiencing particularly high rates of obesity in some countries. The study also finds that obesity rates are rising in both developed and developing countries, with obesity rates in the Middle East and North Africa reaching staggering levels, while obesity rates in the US are still relatively low despite a significant increase in obesity rates in developing countries. The study identifies several factors contributing to obesity, including increased consumption of unhealthy foods, reduced physical activity, and changes in the gut microbiome in modern times. The study concludes that obesity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer, affecting approximately 3.4 million adults per year, and 22% of the world's population is affected by obesity. The report emphasizes the need for addressing obesity through a combination of lifestyle changes, improved diets, and access to healthy food options, as well as the potential role of socioeconomic factors in shaping obesity rates. The study suggests that obesity is a global issue that affects not only wealthy countries but also developing ones, highlighting the importance of reducing obesity rates in all regions. The report calls for a comprehensive approach to address obesity, including the World Health Organization's launch of a commission to study rising obesity worldwide, which aims to identify and recommend solutions to improve public health outcomes. The study underscores the significance of obesity in relation to economic growth, with obesity rates rising alongside population growth, and the need to address obesity as a major public health concern.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

The letter, which was sent via email, is said to be a gesture of rekindling their friendship, despite their estrangement. The article also mentions that Cruise and Holmes have not spoken to each other in over a year, and sources close to the couple claim that the letter has had a positive impact on Holmes, who has been moved by Cruise's thoughtfulness and desire to reconnect with her.

{"pred": "The first round of the Egyptian parliamentary elections, which took place after the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak, saw the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party emerge as the leading candidate, securing a majority of seats in the full Parliament. The Brotherhood's victory is seen as a sign of support for the country's moderate Islamist groups, including the Egyptian Bloc alliance, which includes the Free Egyptians and the social-democratic Party of the Future. The Brotherhood's campaign focused on appealing to the secularists and liberals, while the military rulers have yet to specify the formula for allocating seats among parties based on their share of the vote. The final results are expected to highlight the control of the military and the influence of the religious factions, with the Brotherhood's supporters hoping to form a coalition government to address the economic slowdown and political instability. The Egyptian Revolution of 2011, which brought down Mubarak, sparked concerns about the stability of the country's political system and the possibility of a new era of conflict. The Supreme Court's decision to bring Mubarak's case to trial is seen as a reminder of the need for accountability and the consequences of breaking the law. The prosecution argues that Mubarak was a \"tyrant\" responsible for implementing his son's rule, and the Brotherhood's claims of a third-party alliance and the desire for a coalition government reflect the ongoing struggle between the military and the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood's appeal to the secularists and liberals aims to prevent a further period of instability and to create a stable government, while the military's demands for retaining power and the lack of clarity in the allocation of seats in the new government are seen as challenges for the Brotherhood's prospects. The outcome of the trial and the subsequent elections will determine the composition of the new government and the extent to which the Brotherhood's grip on power is maintained.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house.

Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party.

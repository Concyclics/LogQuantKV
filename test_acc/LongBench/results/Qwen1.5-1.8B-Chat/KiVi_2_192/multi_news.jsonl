The researchers at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and the University of Pavia in Italy analyzed the bloodstain pattern on the cloth, finding it to be inconsistent with the expected placement of bloodstains on a crucified man or a face-down body. The researchers used a living subject and a mannequin to examine the flow of blood on wounds on the left hand, the forearm, the shoulder, and the lower back. They found that the bloodstains were inconsistent with each other, with some appearing to be from a standing position and others from a lying position. The researchers also tested the bloodstains on the Shroud of Turin with real and synthetic blood samples, and found that the cloth is indeed a mess. The researchers concluded that the bloodstains on the Shroud of Turin are inconsistent with the expected placement of bloodstains on a crucified man or a face-down body, making it difficult to determine the actual location of the image of Jesus of Nazareth on the cloth. The researchers say that the bloodstains on the Shroud of Turin are inconsistent with each other, indicating that the cloth may not be authentic.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The ECR project is led by the charity Lumos, founded by JK Rowling, and focuses on eradicating institutionalized children from their families due to poverty, disability, discrimination, and lack of alternative care. The project's goal is to eliminate institutionalized children from the global population by 2050, with a focus on inclusive education, poverty alleviation, employment, and family-based care alternatives. The ECR project has already shown promising results in several countries, such as a 70% reduction in the number of children in institutions in the Czech Republic, a 50% decrease in the number of children in institutions in Bulgaria, and a 74% reduction in the number of children in institutions in Moldova. The ECR project relies on international donors, such as the Global Alliance for Children, to fund its initiatives and promotes the importance of ending the practice of institutionalization. The awareness and advocacy efforts of individuals like JK Rowling, the CEO of Lumos, and the international community have contributed significantly to the movement towards ending institutionalized children.

{"pred": "In Peru, a top investigator named Eusebio Felix Murga was accused of misleading the public by claiming to have captured a group of four alleged criminals who sold the fat of the victims to extract money from the Andean legend known as the Pishtaco. The investigation began when police initially reported that the four suspects, who were arrested, had sold their bodies to rival gangs in exchange for thousands of dollars per kilogram of fat. However, subsequent investigations revealed that the claims made by Murga and other police officials were false, leading to the suspension of Murga from his position. The main points of the story include:\n\n1. Murga's false confession: Murga, the top investigator, claimed to have arrested four individuals who confessed to committing the murders of up to 60 people using the Andean legend of the Pishtaco, a group of ruthless killers who preyed on travelers in the Andes. He stated that the suspects were selling the bodies of the victims and selling their fat to rival gangs in exchange for thousands of dollars per kilogram of fat.\n\nThe four suspects, who were arrested, claimed to have confessed to the crimes, stating that they had killed the victims and sold their flesh to rival groups for the purpose of profiting from the sale of the fat. However, the police found no evidence to support these claims, and the number of victims involved was significantly lower than the initial allegations.\n\nThe Mula investigation faced criticism from the police force, who were accused of misrepresenting the case and excluding the community from the investigation. The head of the police, Miguel Hidalgo, ordered Murga to be placed on indefinite leave, tarnishing the reputation of the police unit.\n\nThe Mula case highlights the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in investigating complex cases involving multiple suspects and the potential for false information to be spread. It also raises questions about the credibility of the investigation and the role of media in shaping public perception of criminal activity in the Andean region, particularly in light of the absence of concrete evidence supporting the claims made by the police.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The tax is expected to generate revenue for the city, but critics argue that it will harm local businesses and contribute to income inequality. The tax is seen as a way to address obesity and diabetes, but it is criticized for targeting low-income communities and failing to address the root causes of these conditions.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The study analyzed data from the Danish National Birth Cohort Study, which tracked the health of over 64,000 children born between 1996 and 2002. The researchers found that women who took acetaminophen more frequently during pregnancy were more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD, a rare disorder characterized by impulsivity, hyperactivity, and difficulty paying attention.

The study authors argue that the risk of these conditions is not solely due to the drug itself, but rather to other factors such as the woman's sensitivity to pain and the potential for infection. The study found that women who took acetaminophen more frequently were more likely to have a higher risk of ADHD and a less severe form of the disorder, which could lead to behavioral problems in their children. The study authors emphasize the importance of avoiding taking acetaminophen more frequently and considering alternative treatments, such as massage, baths, and acupuncture, until more research is conducted.

There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

The study analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute's National Cancer Registry and found that 37,847 out of 258,000 colorectal cancer patients were younger than 50, with 15% of these patients diagnosed in this age group. The study found that younger patients were more likely to develop advanced-stage colorectal cancer, with 30% of patients diagnosed with regional or distant cancers, and 72% of patients receiving aggressive treatments such as surgery or radiation therapy. The study also found that younger patients had longer cancer-free survival times, with 95.1% of patients surviving five years, compared to 91.9% for older patients. In contrast, the five-year survival rate for patients with regional or distant cancers was 76%, while for those with localizations, it was 21%. The study also found that younger patients had longer life expectancy, with 68% living past their cancer recurrence, and 68% surviving beyond their initial course of treatment. The study highlights the need for improved risk assessment and screening practices for younger patients, particularly those with a family history of colorectal cancer, and recommends that guidelines be changed to start screening at a younger age. The study also notes that smoking, obesity, and physical activity are risk factors for colorectal cancer, and doctors should consider these factors when assessing patients with bowel symptoms.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

{"pred": "The article discusses three different ways in which advanced civilizations can potentially dominate the universe through the process of capturing and extracting energy from stars. The first step involves harvesting all of the planet's resources, followed by the second step of capturing all of the star's energy, and finally, the third step of harvesting all the energy from all the stars within a specific galaxy. The author, astrophysicist and senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, proposes that such a civilization would be able to achieve a level of technological advancement that surpasses human levels, making it impossible for the universe to leave them alone in the vastness of space. The author adds that this approach would allow the civilization to capture and store energy from other stars, which they could then use to accelerate the energy of the host star back towards the planet that wants to extract the energy. The article highlights the importance of understanding the implications of the expanding universe and the role of advanced civilizations in shaping the future of the universe, as they would understand the inevitability of the universe expanding and the necessity of capturing and using energy from other stars. The author suggests that advanced civilizations would understand the grim reality of the universe and would expand throughout the cosmos, utilizing massive solar-structured structures such as \"Dyson spheres\" to capture and harness energy from stars. The article emphasizes the potential of such structures to create a vast, self-sustaining energy source that could potentially rival the power of the sun, allowing for advanced civilizations to control the universe and potentially outpace it. The article also mentions the possibility of advanced civilizations having reached a higher level of technology, potentially thousands or even millions of years ago, and the concept of \"distant galaxies\" where advanced civilizations could be found. Finally, the article highlights the importance of understanding the unique light signature emitted by these galaxies and the challenges of detecting them, including the need for precise instruments and the limitations of current instrumentation, highlighting the importance of developing new technologies to detect and analyze the light signatures from these galaxies.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "The Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya contains evidence of a long period of climate-induced behavioral adaptations by early Homo sapiens, leading to the development of a more advanced set of stone tools and pigments. The Olorgesailie Basin is located in the Acheulian culture of the Early Stone Age, which dates back to around 300,000 years ago. The discovery of these stone tools and pigments suggests that early humans in the Olorgesailie Basin were able to develop and use these technologies, possibly due to the influence of climate change and the need to adapt to changing environments. The team of researchers from the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., published three papers in the journal Science, highlighting the development of these stone tools and pigments, which are the first evidence of modern human behaviors in Africa. The Olorgesailie Basin is the only location in Africa where these stone tools and pigments have been found, providing insights into the early development of modern human societies. The Olorgesailie Basin is a crucial site for understanding the origins of modern human behavior, with the Olorgesailie Basin's Acheulian culture serving as a precursor to the emergence of the Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age, which marked the start of the Olorgesailie Basin's development of complex social networks and the exchange of raw materials. The Olorgesailie Basin's Acheulian culture is considered the earliest example of modern human behavior in Africa, demonstrating the importance of climate change in shaping the development of early human societies.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

The National Security Minister emphasized that the legislation does not soften the stance on drug trafficking or the cultivation of illegal plots. The Jamaican government expects the legislation to contribute to the growth of the medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the development of innovative pot-derived items.

The water was lost due to the gradual evaporation of ordinary water, with the heavier form remaining in the atmosphere. The Martian atmosphere has thinned over time, leading to a much deeper ocean covering a fifth of the planet's surface, with the water being lost to space. The ancient ocean on Mars was found to be enriched in deuterium, with a high D/H ratio compared to Earth's oceans. The study reveals that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, with flowing water present in various forms, including a large ocean covering the entire planet's surface, a substantial amount of water lost to space, and a much deeper ocean in the northern regions. The discovery challenges the previous belief that Mars was a dry planet with a limited water supply, suggesting that it may have had a much larger water footprint than previously thought.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

In a series of interviews with Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and other members of the Senate banking committee, Stumpf was criticized for his role in creating and profiting from the cross-selling of customer information to boost the bank's stock price. Warren accused Stumpf of lacking the necessary expertise and accountability, stating that he failed to take responsibility for the bank's actions. Stumpf defended himself, claiming that he was not a lawyer, compensation expert, or credit consultant, and that he did not understand the concept of cross-selling. He also argued that the issue of cross-selling was not a scam but rather a way of deepening relationships between the bank and its customers. However, Warren called for a criminal investigation and demanded that Stumpf resign, return any profits he received, and be investigated by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank's stock price dropped after Stumpf's testimony, and the situation remains tense as the cross-selling scandal continues to unfold.

However, a team of statisticians and engineers have developed a new approach to solving the puzzle. Using Bayes' theorem, they analyzed the data collected from various sources, including historical crashes, to determine the probability of the plane wreckage being located. The team divided the search area into two parts: a grid representing the probability of the plane being found in each region, and a second grid representing the probability of the plane being found in the area where the plane wreckage was discovered. The team used the historical data to identify the likelihood of the plane crashing in each scenario, and then adjusted the probability based on the new information. The team simulated the likelihood of the plane being found in different regions, taking into account the uncertainty of the data and the potential for the plane to be found in previously searched areas. The team also considered the possibility of the plane wreckage being found in multiple bodies of water, such as the Atlantic Ocean, which was not ruled out. The team used Bayesian statistics to analyze the data and came up with a probability that the wreckage was found in the most probable area, which was the ocean. The team's approach involved considering various possibilities and updating the probability based on the new information, which helped to refine the search and increase the chances of finding the plane wreckage.

The report shows that obesity rates have risen across all continents, with the highest rates occurring in the Middle East and North Africa, followed by Asia, South America, and Europe. The study found that obesity disproportionately affects women and men, with 28% of the obese population residing in developing countries. In contrast, the US, with a population of 5%, has a lower obesity rate compared to other wealthy countries like Japan, where obesity rates exceed 50%.

These findings highlight the negative impact of smoking on the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in causing infections.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers discovered that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA by altering its cell walls, making it less susceptible to the immune system's defenses. The bacteria were found to be more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, and their ability to adhere to human cells was enhanced, leading to increased survival and infection rates.\n\nThe second study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, also found that e-cigarette vapor has a similar effect, making MRSA more resistant and potentially contributing to its increased resistance to common treatments. The study suggests that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also acts as a \"warning signal\" to MRSA, enhancing its defenses and making it more difficult to eliminate.\n\nThese findings have important implications for public health, as they emphasize the need for smokers to quit to reduce their risk of not only lung diseases but also the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA.

In 2016, there were 50 cases reported in the US, compared to only 21 in 2015, with the majority affecting children under 21. The highest number of cases occurred in August-December, typically a period when enterovirus infections are prevalent. The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it has been linked to viruses like polio and enteroviruses.\n\nEnterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was suspected in the 2014 outbreak, but the CDC has not detected the virus in all cases. Treatment options are limited, and recovery can be slow, with some patients requiring long-term care. The CDC advises maintaining good hygiene, such as hand washing and staying away from sick individuals, to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nParents and healthcare providers are concerned about the lack of knowledge about the condition, as seen in the case of Carter Roberts, who rapidly lost control of his limbs after a seemingly mild illness. The rise in cases has prompted the CDC to issue health advisories and encourage reporting of cases to state and local health departments. The CDC is also working on identifying the cause and developing treatments, but the condition's long-term effects can leave survivors with permanent disabilities.\n\nIn one case, a 4-year-old child, Laura Carson, was diagnosed with AFM after a respiratory infection, and her recovery involved months of rehabilitation and therapy. The CDC's ongoing investigation and clinical management guidelines aim to provide guidance to healthcare professionals and parents on how to manage the condition and prevent its recurrence.\n\nThe situation highlights the need for continued research and public awareness about AFM, as well as the importance of vaccination to prevent potentially life-threatening illnesses.

Not much is known about the polio-like disease that plagues mostly children, including what causes it. What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing. About 200 kids have been diagnosed since 2014, and this year's figures are especially troubling.

From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully. A CDC study found 68% of patients had a fever and 81% had a respiratory illness before AFM symptoms appeared.

{"pred": "The Shroud of Turin, a revered artifact believed to have been the burial cloth of Jesus, has experienced a new round of scrutiny due to a recent forensic investigation that challenges its authenticity. The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggests that the blood patterns on the cloth are inconsistent with a person being crucified, as they do not match the angles observed on the shroud. Researchers, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli, used blood flow analysis on the cloth to simulate various positions, such as standing, supine, and hanging, and found that the blood patterns do not align with those typically seen in a crucifixion scenario.\n\nThe researchers tested the cloth with both human and synthetic blood, and their findings indicate that the blood flow on the Shroud is inconsistent, with angles varying greatly from the supposed positions on the body. For instance, the rivulets on the hand and the forearm do not match the 45-degree angle suggested by the shroud, pointing to a standing model being used to create the blood patterns. The study also found that the simulated spear wound did not form rivets like those on the shroud, suggesting a different technique or a model that was not suspended vertically.\n\nThe inconsistencies in the blood patterns suggest that the shroud might have been created using a standing model, rather than a crucifixion, casting doubt on its authenticity. The investigation, however, does not rule out the possibility of the cloth being a medieval representation or an artistic depiction. The lack of a consistent blood flow pattern on the shroud is seen as a significant finding, as it contradicts the idea that a crucified person would leave a clear blood trail on the cloth.\n\nWhile the Vatican has not weighed in on the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, this forensic analysis adds to the ongoing debate surrounding the object's historical origins and the methods depicted on it. The investigation leaves the door open for further scientific examination and raises questions about the actual process that created the image on the cloth.", "answers": ["The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion; bloodstains on the linen shroud, which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb, form the image of a crucified man.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports. As the researchers put it, the stains are \"totally unrealistic\" when compared to what they should look like. The shroud, which is held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Italy, is considered an icon, as opposed to a genuine religious relic, by the Vatican; Fox News notes \"the church has never weighed in on its authenticity.\" \"This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,\" the forensic scientist who conducted the analysis tells BuzzFeed News. \"Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.\" The study found inconsistent staining, with researchers concluding multiple poses were used to create the bloodstains—a standing model was likely used to imprint patterns on the cloth at various angles for various body parts. Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

{"pred": "The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), a popular hiking destination, has seen a surge in interest following the success of Cheryl Strayed's memoir \"Wild\" and the movie adaptation. The PCT Association reports a 300% increase in inquiries and permit requests for long-distance hikes due to the book and movie, leading to concerns about overcrowding and its impact on the trail and surrounding communities. The PCTA implemented a permit system in 2015 to manage the growing number of hikers, aiming to distribute the负荷 and prevent overuse of the trail. The current system, with a daily quota of 50 permits, has been effective in managing the crowd, but some worry about reaching the limit and the potential need for a formalized sign-up system to maintain the \"spirit\" of the trail.\n\nWhile more women are hiking the PCT, with estimates suggesting a 30% increase in female thru-hikers, the overcrowding issue is a concern. The PCTA's \"responsibly wild\" campaign, supported by Cheryl Strayed, encourages hikers to practice Leave No Trace principles and protect the environment. The hike's authentic experiences, like Strayed's, can be transformative, but the increasing number of hikers requires a delicate balance between personal growth and the need to respect the trail's natural and human resources.\n\nAs more people attempt the full 2,650-mile PCT, from Mexico to Canada, the challenge lies in managing the growing demand while preserving the trail's essence. The PCTA's permit system, though, is a response to the overcrowding, highlighting the importance of responsible hiking and the need for continued discussion and management.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

This feathered dinosaur, found in northeastern China, has been named for its rainbow-like appearance. The fossilized specimen, with its rainbow-colored feathers, suggests a unique and colorful appearance, unlike any other dinosaurs discovered so far. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, reveals that Caihong's feathers had intricate patterns and barbs, resembling those of birds with a narrow rachis and vanes that create a symmetrical pattern.\n\nThe dinosaur's small size, bird-like head and hindlimbs, and the presence of feathered tails indicate it might have been a predator, possibly gliding or flying. Its feathered structure, with asymmetrical vanes, suggests a possible role in aerodynamics, similar to some early birds.\n\nThe researchers from the Field Museum and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have analyzed the dinosaur's nanostructures using SEM, confirming they are melanosomes, which are responsible for pigmentation in feathers. These findings challenge the idea that these structures are solely bacterial in origin, supporting the theory that they are melanosomes, a feature seen in modern birds.\n\nThe significance of the Caihong's iridescent feathers is not only in their visual appeal but also in their potential function, possibly serving as a sexual attractor or a display feature. The study raises questions about the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs, as they seem to have evolved independently in Caihong, unlike in other dinosaurs like Microraptor, which had a more widespread iridescent coloration.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Caihong juji adds to our understanding of dinosaur feather diversity and the potential roles these feathers played in the animal's behavior and communication.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

However, the study's lead author, Dr. Beate Ritz, emphasized that the risk is not definitive and advised against chronic or long-term use. The丹麦 study did not establish a direct因果 link, and other experts like Dr. Jeff Chapa from Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital also caution against overusing acetaminophen, suggesting alternative methods for managing pain during pregnancy.\n\nThe concern arises from the potential connection between acetaminophen and changes in fetal hormones, which could affect brain development. While acetaminophen is generally considered safe, large doses or prolonged use may be at issue. The FDA has recommended limiting the amount of acetaminophen in products due to concerns about potential harm to the liver. The study's limitations include not comparing acetaminophen to other pain relievers, and the possibility that other factors, such as genetic predispositions, could contribute to ADHD.\n\nThe advice from the researchers is to be cautious and consider alternative options, but they emphasize that the current evidence does not prove a direct link between acetaminophen use and ADHD in children.

Senate Democrats, however, are refusing to accept changes to the ACA, and President Obama would likely veto any bill with these provisions. The Senate's options are limited, with a vote expected on Monday to avoid a shutdown, but the likelihood of passing a bill with the ACA changes is slim.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner is under pressure from conservative Republicans to push for a showdown over the ACA, believing it could provide a political victory for his party. The Senate, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid, is also pursuing a strategy of not making concessions on the ACA, hoping to force Republicans to accept a compromise later.\n\nThe potential shutdown would have significant economic consequences, with the Washington region, home to a large number of federal workers and contractors, expected to lose around $200 million per day and 700,000 jobs.

Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The lead vessel, considered a holy possession with healing properties, is the smallest of its kind, measuring only 2.2 cm (less than an inch) long.\n\nThe discovery of the reliquary, along with a 10th-century Bulgarian royal seal, has shed light on the religious practices of the time. Early Christians believed in the power of relics like this one, as they believed in the healing properties of John the Apostle's remains. The archaeologists believe the relic was transported from the site of his alleged grave in Turkey to the basilica on Cape Foros, where it was later preserved.\n\nThe lead tube reliquary is unique, with only 43 known lead tubes from this period, all of which were used for producing clay tube reliquaries for holy water. The discovery of this specific reliquary in Burgas adds to the list of pilgrimage centers where early Christians, including the grave of John the Apostle in Ephesus, would go on pilgrimage.\n\nThe lead tube containing the ashes of John the Apostle is a rare find, as it is not common to have lead tube reliquaries depicting the apostle's life. The discovery has significant religious and cultural importance, as it connects the Burgas relic to the pilgrimage practices of the Early Christian era.\n\nThe lead tube reliquary's small size, adorned with religious symbols, highlights the importance of these artifacts in preserving and spreading the beliefs of early Christians. The discovery also coincides with the annual celebration of the date associated with John the Apostle's death, where believers believed manna, a holy powder, would appear on the site of his grave in Cape Foros.\n\nThis discovery joins another similar relic found in an ancient monastery on the Black Sea coast, further emphasizing the region's connection to early Christian pilgrimage and the veneration of John the Apostle. The findings not only deepen our understanding of the religious practices of the time but also serve as a tangible link to the spiritual heritage of the region.", "answers": ["Archaeologists in Bulgaria think they've found ashes belonging to one of the 12 apostles.

Astronomer Mike Brown, often referred to as \"Pluto Killer,\" has played a significant role in the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet due to its mass and the influence it exerts on other celestial bodies in the outer solar system. The discovery of Planet Nine, a massive icy planet estimated to be five to ten times the mass of Earth, has been inferred from its gravitational effects on other objects, rather than directly observed. The existence of Planet Nine would require a significant discovery, as it is currently too far from the sun to be visible with current technology. The search for Planet Nine has sparked excitement among astronomers, with some estimating that it could be found within a few years. However, the debate over its planetary status, similar to Pluto's case, is still ongoing, with some scientists arguing that it should be considered a planet based on its influence on neighboring orbits.

The discovery challenges the notion that humans moved slowly into the interior, as the site's location near a spring indicates that people were able to adapt and survive in the region before the harsher climate made it too risky.\n\nThe discovery also highlights the ingenuity of the early humans, who managed to create and use complex technologies like stone axes and ochre, even in the arid environment.

The film's protagonist, a police officer named Philip Krauss, portrayed by Will Poulter, is shown as conflicted, while the film's depiction of the characters, particularly the main suspect, Carl, is criticized for not delving deeply into their personal backgrounds. The movie's realism and the lack of a happy ending are seen as both a strength and a weakness, as it forces the audience to confront the ongoing issue of racial injustice in America.\n\nThe film's violence and the lack of reprieve create a visceral experience, but some viewers may find it uncomfortable and difficult to watch due to its unflinching portrayal. The movie's accuracy is questioned, with some scenes being fictionalized or based on limited information, as the filmmakers relied on real-life witnesses and the late rapper Larry Reed's experiences for inspiration.\n\nThe film's rating, R, indicates strong violence and pervasive language, reflecting the gravity of the subject matter.

The first passage introduces a model proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, classifying civilizations into three levels (Type I, II, and III) based on their energy consumption. Type III civilizations, which harvest energy from all stars in their local galaxy, are suggested to be the most advanced. A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds a new perspective to this idea by suggesting that harvesting energy from distant stars is necessary to avoid the expanding universe's energy loss and the eventual unobservability of those stars. Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations would expand their reach to secure stars before they become inaccessible due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nIn the second news snippet, the website WarcZone serves as a repository for user-uploaded Internet Archive records, not specifically related to alien civilizations, but rather for reference and preservation purposes.\n\nThe third passage discusses the concept of ancient extraterrestrial civilizations creating massive structures, such as Dyson spheres, to harness the energy of their stars. These structures, like the one described by Olaf Stapledon in his novel \"Star Maker,\" would involve a spherical shell of satellites to collect and redistribute starlight for energy. The third level of Kardashev's classification, Type III, is mentioned as a civilization that could potentially construct such structures.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the importance of harvesting distant star energy to prevent energy loss and the need for advanced civilizations to expand their reach through structures like Dyson spheres.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "The news articles discuss the discovery of advanced tools and evidence of trading networks in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya, suggesting that early Homo sapiens and their relatives may have developed these innovations in response to shifting climate conditions. The oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, characterized by smaller, specialized tools and obsidian from distant locations, indicate cooperation and trading among hominid populations. These tools, along with pigment applications, suggest a transition from the earlier Acheulean culture to a more sophisticated Middle Stone Age technology around 320,000 years ago.\n\nThe researchers believe that long periods of climate variability, particularly frequent droughts and floods, drove humans to adapt and innovate, potentially leading to the formation of trading networks and the use of long-distance materials like obsidian. The Olorgesailie tools, along with the presence of red pigment, point to the development of cultural practices and the exchange of resources, possibly for signaling status or identifying group identity.\n\nThe shift to Middle Stone Age tools challenges the traditional view of a \"human revolution\" occurring around 40,000-50,000 years ago, as the authors argue that some of these behaviors were present in the African stone age, with the Middle Stone Age beginning around 300,000 years ago. This discovery at Olorgesailie supports the idea that complex behaviors and cultural advancements were not solely a result of migration out of Africa but rather occurred locally in the region.\n\nThe new findings suggest that the roots of modern human behavior and cultural traits can be traced back to the African continent, challenging the notion that \"modernity\" emerged solely after the emergence of Homo sapiens. The study highlights the importance of environmental pressures and the need for social networks to survive and thrive in the face of changing landscapes.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

The author points out that wired audio often sounds better, and the introduction of Apple's AirPods, with their high price and potential loss, is seen as impractical and possibly expensive.\n\nThe article also highlights the irony that while Apple once promoted the idea of \"it just works,\" the new policy forces users to choose between good sound quality and charging their phones privately, often with inferior wireless options. The shift from a standard 3.5mm jack to a proprietary Lightning connector has been met with a backlash, with some comparing it to the company's retreat from its \"it just works\" mantra.\n\nIn summary, the decision to eliminate the headphone jack has sparked anger and ridicule, with many arguing that it is a move driven by greed and a lack of consideration for consumer needs, rather than true courage.", "answers": ["Apple presented its new smartphone Wednesday, and nestled in with the iPhone 7's much-ballyhooed features was the disclosure that the company is getting rid of the phone's headphone jack—news that wasn't exactly met with universal acclaim, or much acclaim at all.

He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

The incident occurred in March 2014 when the panda, attempting to escape capture, bit Guan, leaving him with severe wounds. Despite the panda's reputation as gentle creatures, they are part of the bear family and can be aggressive if threatened or provoked. This incident highlights the importance of proper conservation measures, as the government agencies involved agreed to pay compensation to prevent similar incidents and protect both humans and wildlife.\n\nGuan's son took legal action against the forestry officials and the Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, which is home to over 100 wild pandas. After negotiations, the compensation was settled, providing coverage for Guan's medical expenses. Giant pandas, native to southwestern China, are protected species with a declining population due to habitat loss, but conservation efforts have led to a slight increase in numbers, according to state data. These animals, despite their cute appearance, can be dangerous if provoked, as seen in previous attacks on humans, including one in 2008.\n\nPandas are significant attractions for tourism, particularly in areas where they are found, but they also serve as a reminder of the need for responsible coexistence between humans and wildlife.

{"pred": "The recent news highlights the discovery of a significant ancient ocean on Mars, which covered a large portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, similar to the Earth's Atlantic Ocean. A study published by NASA scientists using powerful telescopes has revealed that a massive ocean existed on Mars about 4.5 billion years ago, covering 20% of the planet's surface and holding 20 million cubic kilometers of water. This ancient ocean was about a mile deep in some areas and contributed to the growing evidence of a warm and wet Mars during its early history.\n\nThe high concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere indicates a global water loss of at least 137 meters deep, with some basins and high altitude regions showing even higher enrichments. This discovery challenges the previous belief that Mars had limited water presence and suggests a more prolonged period of liquid water existence, which could have potentially supported the existence of life.\n\nNASA's Mars rover missions, including the Mars好奇号, have further supported the presence of liquid water on the planet in the past, with evidence of water lasting for billions of years. The search for life on Mars is gaining momentum, with the European Space Agency's upcoming Exomars rover expected to provide more insights in 2018.\n\nHowever, the exact amount of water and the possibility of life on Mars remains speculative, as the planet's current conditions and the potential for habitability are still being studied. The combination of a global ocean and a warmer climate in the past raises the intriguing possibility that Mars might have hosted life at some point.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

This is the first time that dynamic visual experiences have been decoded from brain activity, offering insights into the inner workings of the mind.\n\nThe study involved subjects lying motionless in an MRI machine, with their brain activity monitored as they watched movie trailers.

Bayesian techniques help update probabilities based on new information, like the plane's flight path, wind patterns, and the likelihood of a crash caused by a deliberate act. In the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian calculations were instrumental in narrowing down the search area after initial efforts failed. The challenge lies in quantifying subjective judgments, as experts must consider factors like the possibility of damaged equipment or the plane's position in relation to previous searches. The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 faces additional complexities due to the higher probability of a deliberate diversion, which affects the focus on specific locations. However, some statisticians argue that the Bayesian approach may not be the best fit for the current situation, as it can be too slow to adapt to significant changes in the case. Despite these difficulties, Bayesian methods continue to provide a framework for analyzing data and adjusting to new information, as seen in the successful recovery of the Air France plane's wreckage.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

This event hasn't occurred for over 150 years and offers a unique opportunity for stargazers in specific regions. The Super Blue Moon Total Eclipse team, led by astrophotographers and a coordinator, will provide live coverage of the eclipse through the Virtual Telescope Project's online sessions.\n\nThe total lunar eclipse will be visible from the Pacific Ocean, with the Moon passing through the Earth's shadow, turning it blood-red due to the eclipse. The eclipse will be visible in the evening sky, starting at 11:30 UT for the online session and later, the Supermoon rising above Rome's landmarks will be showcased at 16:00 UT. The eclipse's visibility ranges from the Pacific Ocean to Eastern Europe, with the moon's passage through the Earth's shadow lasting for 77 minutes.\n\nTo witness the eclipse, people in different time zones can tune in to the Virtual Telescope's live streams, including a 4:00 UTC livestream of the supermoon rising over Rome and an 11:30 UTC eclipse observation from Australia. The moon's visibility will be at its peak during the eclipse, offering a unique opportunity for photography, with tips provided for capturing the event, such as locking the focus on the moon and adjusting exposure.\n\nIn addition to the online sessions, the Virtual Telescope Project will also stream the Supermoon rising above Rome's iconic monuments, allowing people to witness the event without leaving their homes.

For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

A recent study published in the Lancet journal reveals that obesity is a growing concern worldwide, affecting both rich and poor nations alike. The global obesity rate has increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013, with one in three people globally now considered overweight or obese. This includes a significant rise in obesity among children and adolescents, with no country seeing a decline in the past three decades.\n\nThe United States, despite having a smaller portion of its population affected, still accounts for 13% of the world's obese population due to its high obesity rates. However, obesity is rising in developing countries as well, with countries like Tonga, Kuwait, and Qatar seeing obesity rates exceed 50%. The rise in obesity is linked to factors such as increased calorie intake, changes in diet, and sedentary lifestyles, particularly in the form of cheap, high-calorie foods.\n\nThe study's authors note that obesity is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach, with no country so far successfully reducing obesity rates. The problem is not limited to income, as obesity rates are increasing in both rich and poor countries. The World Health Organization is currently working on a commission to address the issue, with a focus on solutions for children, as obesity in this age group is particularly alarming.\n\nIn conclusion, the global obesity crisis is a pressing public health challenge that affects both wealthy and developing nations, with no country showing significant progress in reducing obesity.

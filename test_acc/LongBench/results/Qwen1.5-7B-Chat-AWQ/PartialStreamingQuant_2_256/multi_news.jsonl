These findings suggest that exposure to cigarette smoke can make MRSA more aggressive and harder to treat.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had significantly higher resistance to antimicrobial peptides and exhibited altered cell walls that made them less susceptible to immune defenses. This resistance allowed the bacteria to evade the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species, which are typically used by immune cells to kill pathogens.\n\nThe second study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, also showed that e-cigarette vapor, although not as potent as cigarette smoke, still had a slight impact on making MRSA more resistant. The bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke were four times more resistant to macrophage killing and had a higher likelihood of invading human cells, leading to a higher mortality rate in mouse models.\n\nThese findings emphasize the dual role of cigarette smoke in both harming humans and aiding bacteria, potentially contributing to the increased prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections, particularly in hospital settings where smokers are more susceptible.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have found inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns on the cloth, suggesting they cannot be explained by a body lying flat on the fabric. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions of the wounds, such as those on the hands, forearms, and back.\n\nThe researchers compared the blood flow patterns to the ones on the shroud and found them to be inconsistent with the supposed positions of a crucifixion victim. For instance, the rivulets on the hand and forearm did not match the angles observed on the shroud, which is typically associated with a person hanging from a cross. The blood from the spear wound also showed a different pattern, inconsistent with the vertical flow usually seen in that position.\n\nThe investigation supports the idea that the bloodstains on the shroud are likely from a standing model, rather than a person hanging or lying down. This conclusion contradicts the traditional belief that the shroud's image should be consistent with the crucifixion methods of the time. While the Vatican has not officially weighed in on the authenticity of the shroud, this new forensic evidence raises doubts about its veracity.\n\nThe study's findings, although not definitive, challenge the widely accepted view of the shroud as a historical relic and call for further investigation into its origins and the techniques used to create the blood patterns.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The founder, Ashok Mulheir, shares a personal experience that initially led her to ignore a photograph of a child in a residential institution, realizing that such a common initial reaction is a reflection of a broader societal apathy. \n\nLumos's mission is to shed light on these situations and advocate for the rights of these children. The majority of children in institutions are not orphans but are placed due to inadequate family support or discriminatory practices. The charity emphasizes that the majority of these children have loving parents who can care for them, but lack of resources and support often forces them into institutions.\n\nThe article reveals the harrowing conditions in many institutions, with cold and abusive environments, and the scientific evidence supporting the negative impact of institutionalization on children's development. The organization's goal is to eradicate institutionalization globally by 2050 through investments in education, healthcare, and family-based care options.\n\nLumos' success stories, such as the 70% decrease in children in institutions in Moldova and the 75% drop in admissions in the Czech Republic, demonstrate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of this approach. The author encourages international donors to support the cause, highlighting the economic benefits of investing in children's care within their families rather than institutions.\n\nThe launch of the #Letstalklumos campaign on social media, led by Rowling, aims to raise awareness and engage millions of people in the fight against the harmful practice of institutionalization.

This comes after a previous vote four years ago, where the same issue was narrowly approved.\n\nThe criticism is not new, with a leading shareholder advisory group, Glass Lewis, having raised concerns about the pay packages for both Dudley and other executives. The company's remuneration committee defended the raises, citing the CEO's success in meeting targets related to safety and operational performance. However, the growing trend of shareholder activism and the company's falling performance have led to this unprecedented level of opposition.\n\nDudley's pay, which includes a substantial cash bonus and pension, has been seen as relatively generous compared to peers, with his total compensation package reaching $19.6 million in 2015. The company's board, led by Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg, is now under pressure to review its executive pay policy in consultation with shareholders.\n\nThe vote result highlights the changing attitude of institutional investors towards executive compensation, with some pushing for stricter regulations and clawback mechanisms.

The PCTA emphasizes the importance of responsible hiking and encourages \"leave no trace\" practices to minimize environmental impact and avoid overuse of resources.\n\nWhile the PCTA's permit system aims to protect the trail and its ecosystem, there are concerns about the potential for overcrowding, with some hikers reporting that the current permit system has led to a more regulated and less serene hiking experience. The desire to maintain the PCT's spirit of adventure and inclusivity, as well as the need to balance the number of hikers with the trail's natural and financial resources, is a topic of discussion among hikers, trail angels, and the PCTA.\n\nThe increase in female hikers, as depicted in the example of Cheryl Strayed's hike, suggests a growing interest in the trail.

This small dinosaur, about the size of a crow, lived during the Jurassic Period in China and is the first of its kind to have rainbow-colored feathers.

Researchers believe the feathers may have served as a sexual attraction or a display feature, similar to modern birds.\n\nCaihong's head and chest had prominent, pancake-shaped melanosomes, similar to those in hummingbirds, indicating that the dinosaur had a vibrant, rainbow-like appearance. The study's authors, including paleontologists from the Field Museum and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, used advanced imaging techniques to confirm the presence of melanosomes and rule out bacterial origin for the nanostructures.\n\nThe dinosaur's small size, bird-like head, and long, slender forelimbs suggest it may have been a gliding predator, preying on small mammals and lizards. Its unique combination of feather types, including asymmetrical vanes, indicates a possible role in aerodynamics, similar to that seen in birds.\n\nThe discovery challenges the traditional understanding of dinosaur feather diversity and evolution, with Caihong being the oldest known animal with this type of tail feathering.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial 1.75 cent per ounce soda tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding community projects, has faced significant backlash and is causing economic harm, according to the news passages provided. The tax has led to a 64% increase in the cost of a $15.99 case of Gatorade, with some retailers like Costco redirecting customers to neighboring areas to avoid the tax. Opponents argue that the tax is regressive, affecting low-income families, and has resulted in decreased sales, with some stores seeing drops of up to 47% in sweetened beverage sales. The tax has united diverse groups against it, including labor unions, businesses, and even some health advocates. A study from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University suggests that Seattle's tax is among the most regressive in the country, with examples like Cook County, Illinois, which repealed its own soda tax after public opposition. The tax's effectiveness in improving health is questioned, and some argue that it may drive consumers to buy elsewhere, causing sales to decline in Seattle and potentially hurting local businesses. The tax has also faced legal challenges and has been criticized for not addressing the full range of sugary products and not applying to food stamp purchases. A proposed bill to bring the tax to Spokane, a neighboring city, has been introduced, sparking concerns among local retailers about potential price hikes and lost business. Overall, the soda tax in Seattle has proven to be a divisive and economically challenging measure, with its intended health benefits not fully realized and the city losing revenue from the affected purchases.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The company notified customers about the breach within days, unlike Neiman Marcus. Both Neiman Marcus and Target were targeted by a malware attack, with the iSight report for Neiman Marcus revealing that the operation was innovative and sophisticated, with the source of the malware linked to regions with advanced software coding capabilities, particularly in Eastern Europe and Brazil.\n\nThe report by the federal and private investigators indicates that the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches were part of a broader, international effort targeting multiple retailers. This suggests a coordinated and well-planned cybercrime operation, with the aim of stealing credit card information for financial gain.\n\nThese breaches highlight the growing concern of sophisticated cyberattacks on retail businesses and the importance of timely communication with customers in such cases.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

These findings challenge the traditional belief that colorectal cancer is primarily a disease affecting older individuals. According to the University of Michigan's study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the US was younger than 50, with a higher likelihood of advanced-stage tumors and more aggressive treatments.\n\nYounger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to have distant malignancies, which are associated with poorer survival rates despite the fact that they are diagnosed at a later stage. However, they have a slightly higher five-year survival rate compared to older patients, especially for localized tumors. The study, published in Cancer, highlights the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults.\n\nThe rise in colorectal cancer among younger patients, as reported by the University of Michigan and the Journal of Cancer, has sparked discussions about whether screening guidelines should be adjusted to start at a younger age. While some experts argue that the increased incidence could be due to environmental factors like smoking and unhealthy diets, others, like Harvard Medical School's Andrew Chan, suggest that more research is needed before altering screening recommendations.\n\nThe impact of changing screening guidelines is uncertain, with concerns about the potential benefits and costs. Some experts, like Samantha Hendren from the University of Michigan, acknowledge the need to support young colorectal cancer survivors with long-term care and psychological services. Meanwhile, the Cancer Institute recommends maintaining the current age of 50 for routine screening, emphasizing the importance of considering individual risk factors.\n\nIn conclusion, the growing number of younger colorectal cancer patients calls for a reevaluation of screening guidelines, but the decision to change them must be carefully weighed against the potential benefits and challenges.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The shelter, with its charred roof, indicated the presence of humans burning inside, marking the earliest known use of fire in the area.\n\nExcavations at the site uncovered a wealth of artifacts, including sophisticated tools, bone fragments, and evidence of ochre use, dating back to around 49,000 years. These findings suggest that humans, rather than arriving from the East, had already developed key technologies like stone axes and ochre in the arid interior of the country. The presence of bones from the extinct species Diprotodon optatum, along with burnt eggshells, indicates coexistence and potential interaction between humans and megafauna.\n\nThe Warratyi site challenges the commonly held belief that the climate played a significant role in the extinction of megafauna, as the evidence suggests humans were present and interacting with the animals before the climate became too risky. This discovery pushes the timeline of human settlement in the arid region forward by 10,000 years, highlighting the ingenuity and adaptability of the ancient inhabitants.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of local innovation, as the骨质工具 and ochre use in Australia challenge the notion that these advancements were solely brought from other regions. The study's dating methods, however, are subject to debate, with some estimates differing slightly from the reported 49,000-year-old date.\n\nOverall, the Warratyi rock shelter and its findings provide crucial insights into the early human presence and technological sophistication in Australia, challenging the traditional narrative of a slow and gradual spread from coastal regions.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The research suggests that climate-driven shifts in the region led to the development of specialized tools and the formation of trading networks, potentially involving Homo sapiens and their relatives.\n\nThe oldest Middle Stone Age tools, dated around 320,000 years ago, were smaller, more refined, and made from distant sources of obsidian, indicating the existence of long-distance communication and cooperation. These tools, along with pigment applications, suggest a shift from scavenging to hunting and the emergence of a more diverse set of stone tools, which were likely used for tasks like hunting, digging for water, and possibly even symbolic purposes.\n\nThe shift from the earlier Acheulean culture to the Middle Stone Age was marked by a decrease in the size of tools and the introduction of specialized ones, such as obsidian points and scrapers. This technological change, occurring during periods of environmental stress, indicates the development of more complex social networks and the potential for trading and cultural exchange.\n\nThe new findings challenge the traditional concept of a \"human revolution\" that was believed to happen around 40,000-50,000 years ago, suggesting that modern behaviors like symbolism, innovation, and art were present in the African Stone Age much earlier than previously thought. The Olorgesailie discoveries, along with the presence of red pigment and obsidian from distant sources, indicate a more interconnected and culturally sophisticated society among early humans.\n\nIn summary, the research highlights the importance of long-term environmental changes and the role of social networks in shaping the development of tool-making and behavioral advancements in early Homo sapiens and their relatives, challenging the idea that modern behaviors emerged solely after their migration out of Africa. The findings provide valuable insights into the complexity and diversity of stone tool use and the early stages of human interaction and cultural exchange.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

A massive ancient ocean, comparable to Earth's Atlantic in size, covered nearly half of Mars, holding 20 million cubic kilometers of water. This water, which was up to a mile deep, was inferred from the study of deuterium enrichment in the Martian atmosphere, indicating a global ocean that was 137 meters deep or more.\n\nNASA scientists, using powerful telescopes, have discovered that Mars had a global equivalent water layer that was highly enriched in deuterium, a sign of significant water loss over time. The high concentration of deuterium suggests that the planet's water was at least 8 times more enriched than Earth's oceans, with some basins and high altitude regions having even higher enrichments. This water loss is estimated to have been equivalent to 137 meters of a global ocean.\n\nThe presence of this ancient ocean challenges the previously believed limited availability of liquid water on Mars and raises the possibility of a more habitable environment for life. Mars' current arid conditions, with most water locked up in the polar caps, contrast with the wetter and potentially habitable conditions of billions of years ago.\n\nMethane on Mars, as detected by the Curiosity rover, has been a topic of speculation regarding the potential presence of life. However, the exact origin of the methane is not yet confirmed and could be a result of geological processes rather than biological activity.\n\nThese findings, combined with the recent study that suggests Mars may have had a more temperate climate in its youth, provide strong evidence for a more complex and potentially habitable Martian history.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs likely made a variety of sounds, far different from the roar imagined in popular culture, according to new research. The iconic T. rex's roar from \"Jurassic Park\" is actually a combination of animal noises, not a fossilized sound from the dinosaur itself. Dinosaurs, particularly the dinosaurs that had closed-mouth vocalizations, might have sounded more like doves or pigeons, with their cooing or hooting sounds, rather than the bellowing roars often associated with them.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations, which are low-throated sounds, are not common in small-bodied birds, but they evolved independently in 16 different animal lineages, including birds and crocodiles. These sounds, which are produced by animals like pigeons and ostriches due to their anatomy, are likely to have been present in dinosaurs as well, but without fossil evidence, the exact sounds remain uncertain.\n\nThe study highlights the diversity of vocalizations among birds, with some species using open-mouthed sounds and others闭嘴发声（closed-mouth vocalizations）. These closed-mouth sounds are typically low-pitched and can be produced by animals with large bodies, as they allow for the use of a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch. The researchers believe that the presence of closed-mouth vocalization in dinosaurs, if present, would have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays.\n\nIn Jurassic Park, the sound designers created the dinosaur sounds by mixing real animal noises with synthetic ones, such as using a horse's breathing for the T. rex and a goose's hissing for the raptors. The study's lead author, Tobias Riede, from the University of Texas, explained that the evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and dinosaurs suggests that it can arise easily and be incorporated into mating displays.\n\nWhile dinosaurs like T. rex likely had unique vocalizations, the specific sounds are lost to us, as the majority of dinosaur species have not been fully studied. The discovery of closed-mouth vocalizations in dinosaurs, if present, would provide insight into the diversity of vocal behaviors in these ancient creatures.\n\nIn conclusion, the scientific understanding of dinosaur vocalizations challenges our preconceived notions of their roars and instead paints a picture of these creatures making sounds closer to the cooing of birds. Further research, combining fossil evidence with modern biology, is necessary to uncover the true sounds of these long-extinct creatures.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

Here's a summary of the key events and findings:\n\n1. State Department officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were initially concerned about the use of uniforms for the Marines in the region due to potential diplomatic implications, despite the risk of slowing down the response.\n\n2. The House Benghazi Select Committee's final report reveals a contentious meeting where the focus was more on understanding the attack's causes rather than immediate evacuation. The discussion included a concern about the uniforms, which some argued could hinder security, but did not affect the military's ability to respond.\n\n3. The report by Representative Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo's \"additional views\" document highlights the discrepancy between the public narrative provided by the Obama administration and the private conversations, suggesting the administration intentionally misled the public about the attack's origins.\n\n4. The timeline presented in the \"additional views\" report shows that the administration's public statements were inconsistent with the private communications, with officials acknowledging the attack as a terrorist act, yet publicly attributing it to a protest and a video.\n\n5. The report also reveals that the State Department, including Patrick Kennedy, was concerned about the potential negative impact of uniforms on security, but the military was still forced to change their uniforms multiple times due to the lack of a premeditated plan.\n\n6. The final report by the Benghazi Select Committee, despite being labeled as a \"partisan effort,\" finds that the attack was a terrorist operation and that the administration's initial statements were based on incorrect information.\n\n7. The report's release was criticized by Representative Elijah Cummings, who claims the investigation was partisan and that the committee was prevented from accessing crucial information.\n\n8. The report's findings do not alter the conclusion that the Benghazi attack was a terrorist act, but it highlights the lack of coordination and the administration's handling of intelligence reports.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the confusion and miscommunication within the government regarding the Benghazi attack, with the State Department's concerns about uniforms being overruled, the administration's misleading public narrative, and the partisan nature of the investigation.

How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report.

The United States leads the world in obesity, with 8.5 million obese individuals, or 13% of the population, despite having only 5% of the world's population. However, obesity is a growing problem worldwide, affecting both developed and developing countries, with some countries experiencing staggering rates.\n\nThe study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, reveals that obesity is not limited to wealthy nations; it is rising in poor countries as well. In fact, some countries like Tonga, Kuwait, and Qatar have obesity rates exceeding 50%. The rise in obesity is linked to factors such as increased calorie intake, changes in diet, and a shift towards more processed, high-calorie foods, as well as sedentary lifestyles.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged that obesity is a major health concern, as it is a risk factor for various diseases and contributes to a significant number of deaths annually. The rapid increase in obesity, particularly in children, is a cause for concern, with rates rising 47% in children during the study period.\n\nWhile obesity rates have stagnated in some developed countries, they continue to soar in developing nations, with no countries showing significant improvements in reducing obesity. The researchers call for a global effort to address this issue, as obesity is a public health dilemma affecting people of all ages and regions.\n\nIn conclusion, the obesity epidemic is a universal problem, affecting rich and poor nations alike, and there is a pressing need for effective strategies to combat this growing health crisis.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party is expected to consolidate its lead, with Islamists expected to gain a significant portion of the 150 parliamentary seats up for grabs. The final round of voting saw a focus on the role of Islamists in the new parliament, with the Brotherhood's director, Nabil Abdel Fattah, stating that the party's goal is to form a coalition rather than a single-party government.

The upcoming anniversary of the uprising marks a tense moment, with protests expected to resume on Jan. 25.

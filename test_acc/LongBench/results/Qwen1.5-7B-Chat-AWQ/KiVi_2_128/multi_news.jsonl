They expressed their concerns about corporate greed and the lack of action from the city. The police maintained a calm presence, with no plans to evict anyone, and Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan emphasized the desire for a resolution without confrontation.\n\nIn contrast, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) declared an unlawful assembly on the streets surrounding City Hall and ordered Occupy L.A. protesters to disperse or face arrest by midnight, but the deadline passed without immediate enforcement. The city had been considering removing protesters from the site for renovation purposes, and the mayor's office had warned of potential consequences. In Philadelphia, the situation was more relaxed, with a significant portion of the protesters still occupying the space despite the deadline, and the city was expected to consider allowing them to remain until Tuesday.\n\nBoth cities faced criticism for their handling of the protests, with some demanding a non-violent resolution and others questioning the city's response.

These findings highlight the negative impact of smoking on the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in causing infections.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers discovered that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA by altering its cell walls, making it less susceptible to the immune system's defenses. The bacteria were found to be more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and were better able to adhere to human cells, particularly in smokers. This resistance persisted for 24 hours after exposure, highlighting the potential for transmission and increased mortality in infected individuals.\n\nIn the second study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, e-cigarette vapor also contributed to the resistance of MRSA, although to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. The e-cigarette vapor caused a 10 times weaker effect on bacteria's surface changes, making it less harmful than cigarette smoke in terms of promoting MRSA's virulence.\n\nBoth studies suggest that cigarette smoke acts as a \"warning signal\" to MRSA, increasing its resistance and making it more difficult for antibiotics to effectively treat infections. This could contribute to the increased susceptibility of smokers to MRSA infections and emphasizes the importance of quitting smoking to reduce the risk of these infections.\n\nThe researchers hope these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between smoking and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, potentially leading to new strategies for preventing and treating MRSA infections.

The first study, led by the University of Toulouse's Young-Ho Eom, analyzed Wikipedia articles to determine the most influential people in the English-language world, with surprising results. Initially, Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist, was ranked as the most important person, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, when the study used a more comprehensive method called CheiRank, which considers both incoming and outgoing links, Linnaeus' ranking dropped, and Adolf Hitler took the top spot. The second study, by the Internet Archive, aims to preserve web pages and fix broken links by archiving pages as they are created.\n\nThe study by Eom and his team found that Linnaeus, known as the \"Father of Taxonomy,\" topped the list due to the abundance of scientific names and their connections within Wikipedia. This contrasts with the initial findings of the study, which used Google's PageRank algorithm, which heavily favored Linnaeus.\n\nAnother aspect of the news is the connection between Wikipedia and the influence of historical figures, as seen in the study by Eom, which suggests that the online encyclopedia may skew towards highlighting figures from Western cultures and the 17th century.

The highest number of cases occurred in August-December, typically a period when enterovirus infections are prevalent. The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it has been linked to viruses like polio and enteroviruses, as well as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Symptoms include muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and in severe cases, complete paralysis.\n\nEnterovirus D68, a strain associated with the 2014 outbreak, was not detected in the AFM cases in 2015 and 2016, suggesting that the recent rise in cases may not be directly linked to the virus. The CDC has warned about the importance of hygiene measures like hand washing and staying away from sick individuals to prevent the spread of any potential causative agents.\n\nTreatment options are limited, and most cases require physical therapy, with some showing improvement with therapy, but no cure has been proven for AFM. The CDC is urging healthcare providers to report cases and is monitoring the situation closely. Parents and caregivers should be cautious and seek medical attention for any sudden limb weakness in children, as early intervention is crucial.\n\nWhile the exact cause of the recent rise in AFM cases is still under investigation, the focus remains on preventing the spread of potential pathogens and promoting good hygiene.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggests that the blood patterns on the cloth are inconsistent with a person being crucified, as they do not match the angles observed on the shroud. Researchers, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli, used blood flow analysis on the cloth to simulate various positions, such as standing, supine, and hanging, and found that the blood flow patterns are inconsistent and do not match the positions depicted on the shroud.\n\nThe analysis involved comparing real and synthetic blood samples to determine the flow angles, which revealed discrepancies. For instance, the hand rivulets were observed at angles that do not align with the positions typically associated with crucifixion, with some angles differing by up to 45 degrees. The researchers concluded that the bloodstains are more consistent with a model being positioned to imitate the wounds, rather than a live person.\n\nThe investigation adds to the ongoing debate about the Shroud's origin and the technique used to create the image. While the Vatican has not officially weighed in on the authenticity, the findings raise questions about the authenticity of the bloodstains and suggest that the shroud might be a medieval representation rather than a direct depiction of a crucifixion event.\n\nThe investigation, described as the first of its kind, highlights the need for further examination, as forensic anthropologist Jonathyn Priest from Bevel, Gardner and Associates Inc. notes that the flow patterns found are inconsistent and could be influenced by factors like cleaning the body or the way the body was prepared for burial.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The PCT Association reports a 300% increase in inquiries and permit requests for long-distance hikes due to the book and movie, leading to concerns about overcrowding and its impact on the trail and surrounding communities. The PCTA implemented a permit system in 2015 to manage the growing number of hikers, aiming to distribute the负荷 and prevent overuse of the trail. The current system, with a daily quota of 50 permits, aims to protect the trail and minimize environmental damage. While some hikers are concerned about the impact on the wilderness experience, the PCTA encourages responsible hiking and the use of the hashtag #responsiblywild to promote safety and Leave No Trace principles.\n\nThe increase in hikers, particularly women, is evident, with more than 4,000 long-distance permits issued in 2016, with some hikers potentially exceeding the daily quota. The PCTA's efforts to maintain the trail's authenticity and protect the environment are crucial, as evidenced by the concern over the 500% increase in hikers during peak seasons. The PCTA's permit system, though, faces challenges as it tries to balance the desire for exploration with responsible hiking.\n\nWhile some long-distance hikers, like the 71-year-old Rusty, express concern about the increasing crowds, the PCTA and the hiking community are working to strike a balance between allowing access and maintaining the PCT's essence.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue.

This feathered dinosaur, found in northeastern China, has been named for its rainbow-like appearance. The fossilized specimen, with its rainbow-colored feathers, suggests a unique and colorful appearance, unlike any other dinosaurs discovered so far. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, reveals that Caihong's feathers had intricate patterns and barbs, resembling those of birds with a narrow rachis and vanes that create a symmetrical pattern.\n\nThe dinosaur's small size, bird-like head and tail, and its ability to glide, suggests it may have been a predator, hunting small mammals and lizards. Its unique feather arrangement, with asymmetrical vanes, could have been for aerodynamic purposes, similar to those seen in early birds like Archaeopteryx. The study's authors propose that the feathers' function could have been for communication, possibly attracting mates or serving as a display for mating or territorial displays.\n\nThe fossil's remarkable preservation, thanks to exceptional conditions, allowed for detailed analysis of its nanostructures, which were found to be similar to those of modern bird melanosomes. These findings challenge the idea that these nanostructures represent a derived feature in birds and suggest that the iridescence in Caihong's feathers might have been a unique adaptation in early paravians.\n\nThis discovery challenges the traditional understanding of dinosaur feather evolution, as it pushes the boundaries of what we know about feathered dinosaurs and their potential roles in prehistoric behavior. Researchers are still exploring the specific functions and sexual dimorphism in Caihong's feathers, hinting at a rich and diverse array of behaviors in feathered dinosaurs.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

The FBI and the Justice Department are investigating potential civil rights violations, and the school district plans to review its use of police in schools.\n\nA second student, Niya Kenny, was also arrested and faces charges for her role in the classroom disruption. The NAACP president called for Fields to be charged, and the school district vowed to improve its training to prevent similar incidents.\n\nIn summary, the incident highlights the need for improved police training, especially in handling student discipline, and the ongoing debate about the balance between maintaining order and addressing potential racial biases in law enforcement.", "answers": ["The school resource officer suspended after videos of him throwing a black female high-school student around a South Carolina classroom went viral Monday has been fired, CBS News reports.

Senate Democrats, however, are refusing to accept changes to the ACA, and President Obama would likely veto any bill with these provisions.

In contrast, wildlife officials in South Africa were considering relocating or killing Sylvester, another lion that had escaped, based on its potential threat to humans and the park's wildlife.\n\nThese incidents have raised questions about the management of lions in the wild, as local communities and wildlife experts debate the use of tranquilization versus lethal methods to handle escaped lions. Both countries, Kenya and South Africa, have seen a rise in lion escapes, attributed mainly to habitat loss due to urban expansion and the encroachment of human settlements on lion habitats.

Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—Kenya Wildlife Service officials tell the AP about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it.

Simpson's parole hearing attracted widespread media attention, reminiscent of the high-profile trial from 1995.\n\nSimpson's parole decision sparked a debate about the relevance of his case, with some arguing that the nine-year sentence didn't reflect the severity of the crime. Simpson's associates, including Tom Riccio, were involved in the robbery and have been implicated in the planning and execution of the crime. Simpson's daughter, Arnelle Simpson, testified in support of her father, saying he had been a model prisoner during his time in prison.\n\nThe case of Simpson's parole highlights the enduring impact of the 1994 murder trial, which dealt with themes of criminal justice, race, and celebrity.

The discovery was made during a survey when a rock shelter with a blackened roof, indicating human activity, was stumbled upon by a colleague needing to use the toilet. The site, known as Warratyi, contains evidence of sophisticated tools, ochre use, and interaction with megafauna, such as the extinct Diprotodon optatum. The presence of burnt eggshells and bone fragments, along with the earliest known use of ochre, suggests a complex coexistence between humans and these ancient animals.\n\nThe site's age, estimated to be around 49,000 years, pushes back the timeline of human technological advancements in Australia. The excavation of the site uncovered 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, revealing the use of tools like stone axes and ochre, as well as evidence of interaction with the environment. The site's location in the arid interior of Australia challenges the commonly held belief that the climate barrier prevented early humans from advancing south.\n\nThe discovery of the site challenges the commonly held view that the arid interior of Australia was a barrier for humans, as it shows that they were able to adapt and survive in the region before the climate became too harsh. The presence of bones and shells suggests coexistence with megafauna, possibly indicating hunting or at least close proximity for resource gathering.\n\nThe study highlights the ingenuity and adaptability of the ancient humans, who managed to create and utilise complex technologies in a remote location. The findings challenge the notion that Indigenous Australians were less innovative, as the Warratyi site demonstrates a rich cultural and technological history.\n\nThe research also underscores the need for careful dating and analysis, as the dating of the axe fragment, which has been a source of controversy, is crucial for understanding the true timeline of human occupation in the region.\n\nOverall, the discovery at Warratyi rock-shelter provides valuable insights into the early interactions between humans and the environment, challenging the traditional narrative of the arid interior as a barrier to human expansion and highlighting the adaptability and sophistication of the first inhabitants of the continent.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The first passage introduces a model proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, classifying civilizations into three levels (Type I, II, and III) based on their energy consumption. Type III civilizations, which harvest energy from all stars in their local galaxy, are suggested to be the most advanced. A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds a new perspective to this idea by suggesting that harvesting energy from distant stars is necessary to avoid the expanding universe's energy limitations and the eventual unobservability of stars due to the presence of dark energy. Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations would capture and harvest stars to secure their energy, and that this could be detected through peculiar light signatures or changes in galaxy properties.\n\nIn the second passage, the WarCZone collection hosted by the Internet Archive contains uploaded WARC files that may or may not be part of the Wayback Machine's collection.

{"pred": "The Daily Show, a popular Comedy Central news satire program, experienced significant changes and growth during its run, particularly after Jon Stewart took over as host in 1999. The show's initial focus was on lampooning local news and pop culture, with a mix of humor and criticism of the media. The Daily Show's creator, Lizz Winstead, co-creator Madeleine Smithberg, and correspondent Stephen Colbert were instrumental in shaping the show's tone and content.\n\nStewart's approach to leadership was marked by a desire to challenge the writers and encourage a more pointed, purposeful show with a clear point of view. The show's new direction involved a shift away from the previous focus on random targets and towards using the platform to address larger issues and criticize political figures. This led to conflicts with the writers who were initially resistant to the change, but eventually, writers like Ben Karlin and Steve Carell, with their unique comedic styles and sharp wit, contributed significantly to the show's success.\n\nStephen Colbert, who joined the show as a correspondent, brought a different energy and authenticity, often playing on the stereotype of straight news anchors. His presence, combined with Carell's, helped to evolve the show into a more influential political commentary platform.\n\nThe show's correspondents, like Steve Carell, were not professional journalists but instead used their characters and field pieces to poke fun at the media and political figures, sometimes pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo. The show's success was due in part to its ability to subvert expectations and provide a unique perspective on the news.\n\nOverall, The Daily Show became a significant force in late-night television, influencing the landscape of political satire and providing a platform for intelligent, humorous commentary on current events.

{"pred": "The news articles discuss the discovery of advanced tools and evidence of trading networks in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya, suggesting that early Homo sapiens and their relatives may have developed these innovations in response to shifting climate conditions. The oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, characterized by smaller, specialized tools and obsidian from distant locations, indicate cooperation and trading among hominid populations. These tools, along with pigment applications, suggest a transition from the earlier Acheulean culture to a more sophisticated Middle Stone Age technology around 320,000 years ago.\n\nThe researchers believe that long periods of climate variability, particularly frequent droughts and floods, forced humans to adapt and develop new tools and trading networks. This led to the formation of trading networks, as evidenced by the presence of obsidian from distant locations, indicating the exchange of resources and potentially even the establishment of long-distance social connections. The use of obsidian and other exotic materials, such as red pigment, suggests complex cultural practices and the exchange of goods between different groups.\n\nThese findings challenge the traditional concept of a \"human revolution\" that was thought to occur around 40,000-50,000 years ago, with the development of modern behaviors like symbolism, art, and possibly language, occurring earlier in the African context. The new evidence supports the idea that the roots of these behaviors were present in the region before the migration of Homo sapiens out of Africa.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of considering environmental and social factors in understanding human evolution, as well as the role of climate-driven behavior changes and the development of complex social networks. The researchers argue that the roots of modern human behaviors can be traced back to the Middle Stone Age in Africa, rather than emerging solely after the migration of Homo sapiens to other parts of the world.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

{"pred": "The recent news highlights the discovery of a significant ancient ocean on Mars, which covered a large portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, similar to the Earth's Atlantic Ocean. A study published by NASA scientists using powerful telescopes has revealed that a massive ocean existed on Mars about 4.5 billion years ago, covering 20% of the planet's surface and holding 20 million cubic kilometers of water. This ancient ocean was about a mile deep in some areas and contributed to the growing evidence of a warm and wet Mars during its early history.\n\nThe high concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere indicates a global water loss of at least 137 meters, suggesting a global equivalent water layer that was once present on the planet. The study's lead author, Michael Mumma, suggests that the water on Mars was enriched in deuterium, reaching up to 8 times the Earth's standard value, which would imply a global ocean that was 137 meters deep. However, the exact coverage and depth of the ocean may have been greater due to the planet's unique terrain.\n\nThe presence of this ancient ocean challenges the previous understanding of Mars' water dynamics, as it was not just a fleeting presence but a significant feature of the planet's history. The study's findings have implications for the possibility of habitability, as they suggest that Mars could have been a more conducive environment for life than previously thought.\n\nIn addition to the water, Mars' current atmospheric conditions, with a thin atmosphere allowing for the escape of hydrogen, have led to a higher proportion of deuterium in the remaining water, further supporting the idea of a water-rich environment. The search for life on Mars is gaining momentum, with the European Space Agency's upcoming Exomars rover planned to investigate the planet's potential habitability in 2018.\n\nWhile the exact amount of water on Mars is still being estimated, the evidence points to a wetter past than the current polar ice caps, making it a topic of interest for astrobiologists and planetary scientists.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The outcome could affect other brands with similar product lines, as the court's decision could serve as a precedent for future trademark cases in the European Union.\n\nTheKitKat's shape is not the only issue; there have been previous legal battles over the color purple, where Mondelez lost its trademark for a shade of purple used by Cadbury. These legal disputes highlight the complexities of trademark laws within the European Union, with each country having its own regulations and interpretations.\n\nIn the larger context, the ruling underscores the importance of a brand's distinctiveness being recognized across the entire European market, not just in individual countries. This could lead to a more rigorous assessment of the trademark status for similar products in the future.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs likely made different sounds than the ones commonly portrayed in movies, according to new research. The iconic \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" roar in \"Jurassic Park\" is actually a combination of animal sounds mixed in a sound studio, not resembling the actual roars of dinosaurs. These ancient reptiles, scientists argue, likely produced \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" similar to the cooing of birds. These sounds, which are low-throated, were not present in all dinosaurs, as small-bodied species did not have the necessary vocal organ. The study suggests that closed-mouth vocalization, a unique trait in birds, evolved independently in at least 16 bird lineages, indicating it may have been present in extinct dinosaurs as well, particularly in large-bodied dinosaurs that had the ability to produce these sounds. The lack of evidence for dinosaur vocalizations is due to the fact that vocal organs, made of soft tissues, do not fossilize well, making it difficult to determine their sounds. However, the study implies that closed-mouth vocalizations, though not common, were present in some dinosaurs, possibly during sexually selected vocal displays. This discovery challenges the common perception of dinosaurs as primarily roaring, and opens up the possibility that they may have had more complex vocalizations similar to some modern birds.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

This is the first time that dynamic visual experiences have been decoded from brain activity, offering insights into the inner workings of the mind.\n\nThe study involved subjects lying motionless in an MRI machine, with their brain activity monitored as they watched movie trailers. The researchers then used this data to create a computer algorithm that linked specific brain patterns to visual information, allowing it to reconstruct the videos from the subjects' brain activity. The resulting videos are blurry but reveal the subjects' continuous mental representation of the content they were watching.\n\nThis technology has the potential to delve deeper into the mind, as it could potentially decode thoughts and dreams without visual stimulation. The researchers suggest that one day, this technology might allow for the visualization of internal imagery, like memories and even unexpressed intentions, although the accuracy and legal implications of such interpretations remain uncertain.\n\nWhile the current application is limited to reconstructing visual experiences, the researchers are optimistic about the future applications, including the possibility of using this technology to reconstruct and transmit images from a person's mind, particularly for individuals with paralysis who rely on brain signals to communicate.\n\nIn summary, this groundbreaking research opens up exciting possibilities for understanding and manipulating the human mind, but the ethical and legal implications of such capabilities remain to be fully explored.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

Autopilot was engaged at the time of the accident, with the driver having received warnings and not having their hands on the wheel for six seconds before the collision. The severity of the crash was attributed to the damaged barrier, which had not been repaired after a previous accident.\n\nTesla acknowledged that Autopilot was engaged and stated that the company is working to improve its systems and prevent similar incidents. The NTSB's investigation revealed that the vehicle's logs showed no action was taken by the driver despite having a clear view of the damaged barrier.

The first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that exposure to cigarette smoke enhances the virulence of MRSA by making it more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and altering its cell walls, reducing its susceptibility to immune defenses. This makes the bacteria more adept at adhering to human cells and resisting the actions of immune cells, such as macrophages.\n\nThe second study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, also showed that e-cigarette smoke, although not as potent as cigarette smoke, can also increase MRSA's resistance. The bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke extract became four times more resistant to macrophage killing and 10 times more likely to adhere to human cells, leading to a higher risk of infection and increased mortality in mice.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke acts as a kind of alarm for MRSA, prompting it to develop resistance to antibiotics. The researchers emphasize that this could contribute to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infections, as well as the potential for antibiotic-resistant infections to spread more easily in healthcare settings.\n\nThe studies highlight the need for further research on the interaction between smoking and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as well as the importance of quitting smoking to reduce the risk of not only lung diseases but also the spread of antibiotic-resistant infections.

The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions of the wounds, and their analysis revealed that the blood flow patterns do not match the positions depicted on the shroud.\n\nThe researchers tested the blood from different body parts, such as the hand, forearm, chest, and back, and found that the angles of the rivulets were inconsistent with those that would be expected from a person on a cross, with some angles differing by up to 45 degrees. This inconsistency supports the theory that the blood patterns were created by a standing model, rather than a crucifixion victim.\n\nRadiocarbon dating places the shroud within the 13th to 15th centuries, which aligns with the time period of the Middle Ages.

The PCTA reports a 300% increase in inquiries and long-distance hiking permits since the publication of the book and the release of the film. This has led to concerns about overcrowding, with some hikers reporting that the 50-per-day permit quota is often reached during the peak hiking season. The PCTA implemented the permit system in 2015 to manage the growing number of hikers and protect the trail and its environment. The increase in female thru-hikers, from less than 10% to around 30%, is also noted. The PCTA encourages \"leave no trace\" practices and has launched a campaign with the hashtag #responsiblywild to promote safety and responsible hiking. While some hikers are concerned about the overcrowding, the PCTA aims to maintain a balance between allowing access and preserving the trail's natural beauty and solitude. The current system, though, is a test for the PCTA and the hikers who rely on the honor system to manage their permits.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

Discovered in northeastern China, this small dinosaur, about the size of a crow, had feathers that featured rainbow colors, making it the first of its kind to be found. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, reveals that the dinosaur's feathers had intricate patterns and were likely used for both sexual attraction and possibly for flight, as its hindlimbs were relatively short, suggesting it might not have been able to fly.\n\nCaihong's head and chest had prominent, pancake-shaped melanosomes, similar to those found in hummingbirds, which create iridescent hues. These nanostructures were identified through advanced scanning electron microscopy, confirming they are not from bacteria but melanosomes, supporting the idea that the feathers were pigmented. The dinosaur's body feathers were long and narrow, with sub-parallel barbs, and its tail feathers were particularly large and well-preserved, with distinct vanes that showed a unique pattern.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that the iridescence might have served as a communication tool, similar to modern birds. The dinosaur's unique combination of feather types, including asymmetrical vanes, indicates a possible evolutionary link to birds, as it shares this feature with the earliest known bird, Archaeopteryx. The fossil's condition, with feathers well-preserved, provides valuable insights into dinosaur feather diversity and the potential roles they played in the animal's behavior and communication.\n\nIn summary, Caihong juji, the \"rainbow dinosaur,\" is not only a visually stunning creature but also holds clues to the evolution of feather coloration and the role of feathers in dinosaur communication.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The House has approved a bill to fund the government until December 15, with conditions including a one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and a rollback of the medical device tax. Senate Democrats, however, are refusing to accept changes to the ACA, leaving House Speaker John Boehner in a difficult position. If the House passes a bill without the ACA provisions, it is unlikely to be signed by President Barack Obama, who would likely veto it. The Senate, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid, is expected to reject any attempts to delay the ACA, setting up a showdown that could result in a shutdown.\n\nA shutdown would have significant economic consequences, particularly in the Washington region, where the government employs a large portion of the workforce. The Senate has already stripped out the House's anti-ACA provisions, and the House must now pass a clean funding bill to avoid a shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Reid is determined to hold firm on the ACA, believing that a shutdown would harm the Republicans politically. The White House and Democratic leaders are united in their refusal to make concessions on the health law, leaving Speaker Boehner with the challenge of passing a short-term funding bill without the ACA provisions.\n\nAs the deadline looms, both parties are working to shift the blame and pressure on the other side. Republicans are calling for Speaker Boehner to accept a year-long delay of the ACA, while Democrats are advocating for the continuation of the law.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business.

The planet's existence, if confirmed, would require a new planet classification, as the current definition by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) excludes Pluto.\n\nBrown, known as the \"Pluto Killer,\" initially believed Pluto was in danger due to its discovery of a massive object in the outer solar system, which led to the IAU's decision to redefine the planet's classification. The search for Planet Nine, however, has been challenging due to its distance and faint light, requiring advanced telescopes to spot it.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked a debate among astronomers, with some, like NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, cautioning that extraordinary evidence is needed.

The study, published in Cancer, showed that younger patients are more likely to have advanced-stage tumors and require more aggressive treatments, despite having lower recurrence rates.\n\nThe study by the University of Michigan's Samantha Hendren and her team found that younger patients with colorectal cancer were more likely to have tumors that have spread to the lymph nodes or other organs, leading to a higher likelihood of undergoing surgery (72% for those under 50 compared to 63% for older patients) and radiation therapy for rectal cancer patients (53% for those under 50 compared to 48% for older ones).\n\nDespite the advanced stage at diagnosis, younger patients had slightly better survival rates, with a five-year survival rate of 95% for localized tumors, 76% for regional tumors, and 21% for distant metastases.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

Jon Stewart's vision for the show was to be more pointed, focused on issues, and have a surgical approach to comedy. The transition from the Kilborn-era writers to Stewart's team was marked by conflicts and disagreements, with some writers feeling the new direction was too aggressive.\n\nStewart's first correspondent, Stephen Colbert, joined the show after a brief stint at ABC and was initially seen as a straight-faced correspondent, but his chemistry with Stewart and the show's unique format allowed him to thrive. The show's success led to the hiring of Steve Carell, who became a correspondent and brought a new dynamic to the show with his character, often playing the straight man and poking fun at media stereotypes.\n\nDuring the 1990s, The Daily Show capitalized on the growing political landscape, with correspondents like Colbert and Carell using the show to comment on the media's coverage and the political process.

{"pred": "The news articles cover groundbreaking discoveries in the field of archaeology, revealing the advanced tool-making and behavioral changes among early humans in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin. The research suggests that climate-driven shifts in the region led to the development of specialized tool-making, including the use of obsidian from distant locations, indicating the existence of trading networks among early Homo sapiens or their relatives.\n\nThe oldest Middle Stone Age tools, dated around 320,000 years ago, were smaller and more finely crafted, reflecting the need for adapting to variable landscapes. These tools, along with pigment application, suggest a shift from scavenging to hunting and the potential for more complex social interactions and communication. The Olorgesailie environment, with its frequent climate shifts, forced humans to be more adaptable and innovative, leading to the formation of trading networks.\n\nThe findings challenge the traditional concept of a \"human revolution\" that was believed to occur around 40,000-50,000 years ago, suggesting that modern behaviors like symbolism, innovation, and art were present in the African Stone Age, as early as 280,000 to 500,000 years ago. The new evidence from Olorgesailie supports the idea that these changes were not solely a result of a single event but rather a gradual process, with different regions and populations developing unique technologies and cultural practices.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of long-distance exchanges of materials, such as obsidian and pigments, which were transported over significant distances, suggesting the existence of social networks and intergroup interactions. This evidence challenges the notion that \"modernity\" emerged solely after the departure of Homo sapiens from Africa, and instead, it hints at a more complex and diverse evolution of human behaviors and technologies within the continent.\n\nIn conclusion, the discoveries in these studies provide a new perspective on the development of human cognition and cultural sophistication, demonstrating that the roots of modern behaviors and complex thinking can be traced back to earlier periods in Africa, long before the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species. The study of these tools and materials offers insights into the adaptability and social connectivity of early humans, challenging the traditional narrative of a sudden \"human revolution\" and highlighting the importance of environmental pressures in shaping human evolution.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

In 2011, the company was raided by the Justice Department over accusations of using illegally sourced wood, particularly from Madagascar, which led to a halt in production and a significant disruption to the business. The U.S. Justice Department claims that the company was aware of the risks associated with the wood's origin and still proceeded to import it. Gibson denies the allegations, stating that they have been compliant with both U.S. and Malagasy laws.\n\nThe situation highlights the intersection of music and environmental regulation, with the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) stating that the company was required to verify the legality of their supply chain, not just \"certify\" it. The recent raid in 2011 followed a similar incident in 2009, where the company faced a seizure of ebony from Madagascar. This has caused concern among other guitar manufacturers, such as Chris Martin of C.F. Martin Guitar Co., who supports the Lacey Act but acknowledges the challenges it poses for verifying the provenance of vintage instruments.\n\nThe Lacey Act, which covers not only animals but also plants, has raised questions about retroactive compliance for guitar makers, potentially forcing them to prove the legality of wood used in guitars made decades ago. This has led to concerns among attorneys representing these manufacturers and a shift in the guitar industry in Nashville, with dealers like George Gruhn finding it difficult to navigate the legal implications.\n\nIn addition to the legal battle, the article mentions that the Internet Archive, under Alexa Internet, has been collecting data since 1996, which are eventually added to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine after a certain embargo period.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

{"pred": "The recent discoveries in the field of planetary science have shed light on Mars' past, revealing a significant body of water that once covered a large portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. A study published in the journal Science indicates that a massive ancient ocean, comparable to Earth's Atlantic, covered a fifth of Mars' surface and contained 20 million cubic kilometers of water, or more. This ocean, which persisted around 4.5 billion years ago, was a key factor in the planet's potential habitability.\n\nNASA scientists, using powerful telescopes, discovered a high concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere, indicating a significant water loss over time. This heavy hydrogen enrichment suggests that the planet's water, initially equivalent to 137 meters deep, was much more extensive, potentially forming a global ocean. The researchers estimate that the water would have been at least 8 times more enriched in deuterium than Earth's oceans, leading to a global ocean that could have been as deep as 137 meters.\n\nThese findings challenge the previous understanding of Mars' water presence, which was believed to be sporadic and insufficient for creating a global ocean. The presence of a large ocean on Mars raises the possibility of a more habitable environment in its early history, encouraging further exploration for signs of past life.\n\nNotably, Mars' current atmosphere lacks the same proportion of hydrogen as Earth, with a significant amount having leaked into space due to the planet's weaker gravitational pull. This difference in deuterium levels between Mars and Earth highlights the importance of understanding the planet's water cycle and the conditions under which it could have supported life.\n\nWhile the exact amount of water on Mars is still being estimated, these new findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that Mars may have had a more complex and potentially habitable history than previously thought.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long thought to roar with the ferocity of movie monsters, might have sounded more like birds, according to new research. The study reveals that the ancient reptiles, including the iconic T. rex, likely produced \"closed-mouth vocalizations\" that were similar to the cooing of doves or the mumbles of ostriches. These sounds, unlike the high-pitched chirps of birds with open mouths, were low-throated whooshes. The researchers found that these vocalizations were more common in large-bodied birds, suggesting that they may have been present in extinct non-avian dinosaurs as well.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the Jurassic Park movie, shared that the raptors' hissing was inspired by the sound of a goose, and the T. rex's roar was created by mixing baby elephant sounds. The study, published in the journal Evolution, suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are rare in small-bodied birds, were likely an evolutionary adaptation in dinosaurs as well, possibly for sexually selected vocal displays.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations are characterized by sounds produced through a throaty, low-pitched process, unlike the high-pitched calls of birds with open beaks. The researchers believe that the absence of these vocalizations in some dinosaurs could be due to the evolution of a separate vocal organ, the \"syrinx,\" which is similar to a bird's larynx but with two prongs.\n\nWhile there is no direct fossil evidence of dinosaur vocalizations, the study's findings imply that at least some dinosaurs, like birds, had the ability to produce these unique sounds. The researchers caution that the exact sounds of dinosaurs remain uncertain, but the presence of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds suggests that they may have been a feature in the evolutionary history of dinosaurs.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery challenges the popular conception of dinosaur roars and underscores the complexity of their vocalizations, which were likely more akin to the cooing of birds than the imagined screeches of the film's T. rex. Further study of dinosaur vocalizations, combining fossil evidence with modern biology, is necessary to fully understand these extinct creatures' sounds.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

They have developed a technique that allows them to reconstruct YouTube videos from the brain patterns of subjects who watched the videos while lying in an MRI machine. By analyzing the amount of blood flow to specific parts of the brain associated with visual processing, the researchers created a continuous, albeit abstract, reconstruction of the original videos, marking a step forward from previous static image reconstructions.\n\nThe study demonstrates the potential for using this technology to delve into the realm of dreams and thoughts, as it could potentially reveal what's happening in a person's mind without external visual stimulation. The researchers believe this could lead to the ability to \"see through\" others' eyes, giving insights into internal imagery, such as dreams and memories.\n\nThe process involves matching brain activity patterns to YouTube videos, and then using the data to create a computer model that decodes visual scenes. While the reconstructed videos are blurry, they provide a glimpse into the mental processes that occur during visual perception. The technology has the potential to be applied in various fields, including helping paralyzed individuals communicate and even potentially unlocking the secrets of our dreams.\n\nHowever, the application of this technology to dreams and memories raises ethical concerns, as it could potentially invade privacy and manipulate memories.

The main focus is on the Republicans' resistance to the sequester, a series of automatic spending cuts, and their preference for avoiding tax increases. Instead of engaging in significant legislative activity, the House has been holding sessions for formality, such as the one where Rep. Foxx requested a roll-call vote on the journal of proceedings, which was a time-wasting exercise.\n\nThe sequester, intended to force both parties to compromise, has become a political tool for both the Republicans and the Democrats. The legislation to rename the facility, H.R. 667, passed in the previous Congress, but its passage in the current session was a formality, with a short debate and a unanimous vote. The House Speaker, John Boehner, criticized the president's emphasis on tax increases and urged for a reduction in spending, rather than a repeat of the previous tax hike.\n\nThe Republican party's stance on the sequester is one of resistance, with Speaker Boehner instructing the president to work on a new budget deal. The irony of the situation is highlighted, as the law will not cut the salaries of Congress members, while essential services and programs, such as those in healthcare, education, and national defense, face significant cuts.

His dedication to pleasing kids, as seen in films like \"Hook,\" \"Aladdin,\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" earned him a special place in the hearts of his generation.

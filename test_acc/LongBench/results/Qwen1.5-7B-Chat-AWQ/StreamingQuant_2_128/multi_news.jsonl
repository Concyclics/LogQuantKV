These findings highlight the negative impact of smoking on the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in causing infections.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers discovered that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA by altering its cell walls. This resistance is achieved through the suppression of reactive oxygen species, which are essential for immune cells to kill bacteria. The bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke were found to be four times more resistant to macrophage killing and 10 times more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, making them more difficult to eliminate.\n\nThe second study, also led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, revealed that e-cigarette smoke, although not as potent as cigarette smoke, also has a similar effect on MRSA. E-cigarette vapor also makes the bacteria more resistant and less susceptible to the immune system's defenses. The study showed that e-cigarette-exposed MRSA caused less severe mortality in mice but still had a significant impact on infection rates and the ability to invade human cells.\n\nBoth studies emphasize the role of cigarette smoke in promoting MRSA's resistance and suggest that smokers may be at a higher risk for antibiotic-resistant infections due to this interaction.

However, when the researchers used a different measure called CheiRank, which considers both incoming and outgoing links, they discovered that Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist, was the most influential figure. Linnaeus' extensive work in taxonomy, as well as the prevalence of scientific names in Wikipedia, contributed to his high ranking.\n\nThe study aimed to investigate if Wikipedia's content was biased towards certain historical figures, particularly in terms of gender, time, or location.

Researchers from Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences have used blood flow analysis to examine the bloodstains on the cloth, which they claim are inconsistent with the positions of a person being crucified. The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found that the patterns on the shroud do not match those expected from a person hanging on a cross or lying on their back, as the blood flow angles are not consistent with the reported positions.\n\nThe researchers used blood from both real and synthetic sources to simulate the wounds on the cloth, analyzing the flow of blood on various body parts, such as the hand, forearm, and back. The results showed that the angles of the rivulets on the fabric do not match the positions suggested by the shroud, pointing to a model or a standing position being used to create the bloodstains.\n\nThe investigation supports the idea that the blood on the shroud may not have been from a crucifixion, but rather from a standing model, casting doubt on the authenticity of the blood patterns. While the Vatican has not officially weighed in on the shroud's authenticity, the study's findings challenge the commonly held belief that the shroud is the actual burial cloth of Jesus.\n\nIn summary, the Shroud of Turin's bloodstain analysis suggests that the cloth may not have been the result of a crucifixion, but rather a medieval representation, leaving the question of its authenticity unresolved.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary.

Caihong's head and chest had prominent, pancake-shaped melanosomes, indicating the presence of iridescence.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

Bloomberg highlighted Perry's support for the HPV vaccine and Romney's successful health care plan in Massachusetts.\n\n2. Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, who has considered running for the presidency, expressed forgiveness for Rick Perry's debate performances and praised his decision to endorse Mitt Romney. Daniels also commended Senator Mark Warner for his work on the federal budget.\n\n3. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus criticized President Obama's campaign slogan and accused the tea party of causing the current political deadlock. He argued that the tea party's \"make-or-break\" stance was hindering progress.\n\n4. Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, criticized the tea party's role in the government shutdown and called it \"embarrassing.\" He blamed House Speaker John Boehner for the impasse.\n\n5.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial 1.75 cent per ounce soda tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding community projects, has faced significant backlash and is seen as a burden on both consumers and businesses. Former Mayor Ed Murray, who championed the tax, now admits it may not have achieved its intended goals. The tax has led to a dramatic increase in the price of sugary beverages, with a 64% jump in the cost of a Gatorade case at Costco. Consumers are responding by shopping at locations outside the city, where the tax is not imposed, causing a decline in sales for retailers and potentially affecting the tax's revenue collection. The tax has been criticized for being regressive, as it disproportionately impacts low-income families and those who buy sugary beverages. Some, including Starbucks, have refused to collect the tax on certain products. In Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed after a public backlash, and the same issue of reduced sales and customer migration to neighboring areas is expected to affect Seattle. The tax has been called a \"regressive, job-killing\" measure, with some retailers like Costco and consumers expressing dissatisfaction. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University suggests that Seattle's tax may not be effective in achieving its health goals and has instead led to a loss of revenue and a decrease in sales for retailers. The situation has sparked debates about the effectiveness of such taxes and the potential negative consequences for local businesses and public health.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Her pregnancy has slowed down the production of her spin-off show, \"Snooki and JWoww v. The World,\" as the pregnancy was said to have caused delays. Snooki's pregnancy has raised concerns about balancing her career and personal life, especially with her past association with alcohol, which could potentially affect her ability to care for the child. However, she has expressed a desire to be a good mother and has acknowledged the challenges that come with it.\n\nIn addition to her personal life, the article highlights the growing number of young, single mothers in the United States, with statistics from the New York Times revealing that over 50% of births to American women under 30 are to unmarried parents. This shift in family dynamics has led to the recognition of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs), which are caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. These conditions can include growth deficiencies, behavioral issues, and neurological problems, but the severity varies among individuals.\n\nSnooki's situation is unique, as her lifestyle and past drinking habits could exacerbate the challenges of being a mother. She has faced criticism for her partying ways, which could potentially affect her ability to provide for the child and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

{"pred": "NASA's upcoming mission to study the sun, known as the Parker Solar Probe, has been renamed to honor the late solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind. The spacecraft, originally known as Solar Probe Plus, will now bear Parker's name, marking the first time a spacecraft has been named for a living scientist. Parker's work, which involved predicting a high-speed solar wind, has been crucial for understanding the sun's atmosphere and the acceleration of solar wind. The probe, set to reach within 3.9 million miles of the sun's surface, aims to unravel the mysteries of the sun's corona, including its high temperature and the acceleration of solar wind. The mission's success could have significant implications for our understanding of space weather and its potential impact on Earth, particularly in terms of space weather events that can disrupt power grids and satellite operations. The Parker Solar Probe's journey will involve seven close flybys of the sun, with the spacecraft's instruments protected by a heat shield that can withstand extreme temperatures. The mission is expected to provide valuable insights into the sun's behavior and help scientists forecast space weather events that can cause significant disruptions on Earth.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The Neiman Marcus breach, which began as early as mid-July, went undetected until mid-December, when the company first disclosed the issue after discovering suspicious activity involving credit card purchases. The breach involved the theft of customer data, with Neiman Marcus stating that they have taken steps to notify affected customers and that their investigation found no evidence of Social Security numbers or birth dates being compromised.\n\nTarget, on the other hand, suffered a larger-scale attack that affected 40 million customers, with credit and debit card information potentially stolen, along with PINs for some. Target initially notified its customers about the breach within days, unlike Neiman Marcus, which faced criticism for delayed disclosure. The breach investigation revealed that the attack was carried out using malware, a type of software that was innovative and sophisticated, with the source of the malware being linked to regions with advanced software coding capabilities, particularly in Eastern Europe and Brazil.\n\nThe report by the computer firm iSight, which was filed to the US Secret Service, highlights the global nature of these attacks, suggesting that they were part of a broader, coordinated effort. The hackers used a technique called \"memory scraping,\" which is new to the eCrime community, to extract credit card information without leaving a clear trail. This type of POS (point-of-sale) hacking is considered risky and costly for traditional criminals but offers significant rewards for cyber crooks due to its low risk and potential for large-scale data theft.\n\nThe investigation into the Neiman Marcus and Target breaches indicates that they may be connected, with both cases possibly part of an international cybercrime operation.

{"pred": "The three news passages provide insights into the relationship between yo-yo dieting and its potential negative effects on heart health, particularly in individuals with coronary artery disease. Passage 1 highlights a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, which found that repeatedly losing and regaining weight can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and mortality by 78%, 117%, and 124% respectively. The study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, emphasizes the importance of maintaining weight stability for heart health.\n\nPassage 2 explains that coronary artery disease, the primary cause of heart attacks, occurs when cholesterol deposits in arteries lead to narrowed blood flow. Yo-yo dieting, or weight cycling, is associated with increased risk for heart disease, as it contributes to the development of plaque and narrowed arteries. This can result in chest pain, shortness of breath, and potentially life-threatening complications.\n\nPassage 3 presents a new research study that reveals a significant association between yo-yo dieting and worse health outcomes for individuals with coronary heart disease. The study, conducted by Dr. Bangalore and his team at the NYU Langone Medical Center, found that people with large fluctuations in weight had a 124% higher risk of death from heart attack, stroke, and diabetes compared to those with minimal weight changes. This risk was independent of other risk factors.\n\nThese findings emphasize the need for a healthier lifestyle to prevent and manage coronary artery disease, as suggested by Dr. Bangalore. While the connection between yo-yo dieting and heart health is not definitively proven, the study's results prompt a discussion on maintaining weight stability and understanding the role of gut microbes in weight fluctuations.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the potential dangers of yo-yo dieting for individuals with coronary artery disease, linking it to increased risks of heart attacks, strokes, and deaths. While more research is needed to establish causality, the findings suggest a need for better strategies to promote long-term weight stability and support for individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another. And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

These findings challenge the traditional belief that colorectal cancer is primarily a disease affecting older individuals. According to the University of Michigan's study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the US was younger than 50, with a higher likelihood of advanced-stage tumors and more aggressive treatment requirements.\n\nYounger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to be diagnosed with regional or distant malignancies, which are more dangerous than localized tumors. They are also more likely to receive surgery (72% for younger patients versus 63% for older ones) and radiation therapy, especially for rectal cancer patients. Despite the advanced stage at diagnosis, younger patients have slightly better survival rates, with a 5-year survival rate of 95% for localized tumors and around 21% for distant disease.\n\nThe study by the University of Michigan's Samantha Hendren highlights the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger patients. However, there is debate about whether changing the recommended screening age from 50 to younger ages, as suggested by the study, would ultimately prevent more colorectal cancer deaths. Some experts, like Harvard's Andrew Chan, argue that the evidence is not strong enough to support this change, as the risk remains low among younger patients.\n\nThe study's findings prompt a call for the medical community to be more vigilant in recognizing the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients and to consider starting screening earlier for those with a family history or other risk factors. However, any decision to alter screening guidelines would require careful evaluation to balance potential benefits and potential harm.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients necessitates a reevaluation of screening practices, but the impact on overall survival and the potential benefits of changing guidelines remain uncertain.

The site's age, around 49,000 years, challenges the commonly held belief that humans entered the arid interior of Australia later, around 50,000 years ago. The presence of bones from the extinct species Diprotodon optatum and burnt eggshells suggests coexistence and possibly interaction between humans and megafauna, challenging the commonly held view that climate change was the sole driver of megafauna extinction.\n\nThe excavation process at Warratyi involved careful recording and analysis of artifacts, with some dating back to 49,000 years, providing insights into the technological advancements and cultural practices of the early humans in the region. The site's location in the arid interior of Australia indicates that people were able to adapt and innovate, moving south despite the challenges posed by the harsh climate.\n\nThese findings challenge the conventional timeline of human migration in Australia and suggest a more complex and innovative local adaptation, rather than a straightforward coastal-to-interior movement. The study also highlights the ingenuity of the ancient inhabitants, who were able to create and utilize advanced technologies in a remote location.\n\nThe discovery of the Warratyi site challenges the perception of Indigenous Australians' technological capabilities and underscores the importance of considering local cultural evolution in understanding their history.

{"pred": "The three news passages discuss various aspects of advanced civilizations, energy expansion, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). The first passage introduces a model proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, known as the \"three types of technologically advanced civilizations\" (Type I, II, and III), which suggests that a Type III civilization, capable of harvesting energy from all stars in its local galaxy, would be able to secure a vast amount of resources and potentially expand across the universe. A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds a new perspective to this concept, suggesting that the expansion of the universe due to dark energy makes it imperative for advanced civilizations to capture and harvest stars from neighboring galaxies to avoid losing access to their energy. Hooper proposes that such civilizations would create \"Dyson spheres\" or \"swarms of satellites\" to collect and beam energy back to their home planets.\n\nIn the second passage, the Internet Archive's WARC Zone collects outsider-uploaded WARCs, which are not necessarily part of the Wayback Machine but serve as a reference for researchers and the general public interested in specific web content. These WARC files are not ingested into the Wayback Machine but are maintained for reference and analysis.\n\nThe third passage delves into the concept of advanced alien civilizations, particularly Type III civilizations, which could create massive structures like Dyson spheres to harness the energy of their stars. These structures would consist of millions of individual satellites, or statites, that would collect and transmit energy back to their home planets. The search for such civilizations involves looking for unusual galaxy signatures, such as the absence of normal starlight and the presence of peculiar radiation patterns, as well as the detection of Dyson spheres through their unique light signatures.\n\nIn summary, the three news passages explore the idea of advanced civilizations expanding their energy resources, the potential for detecting them through their waste heat, and the hypothetical structures they might create to harness starlight. The focus is on the importance of energy harvesting in the face of the expanding universe and the possibility of detecting signs of advanced alien civilizations through unique galaxy characteristics. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is not only a theoretical pursuit but also a topic of scientific interest and speculation, with references to science fiction and real-world scientific proposals.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

The show's host, Jon Stewart, took over in 1999 after a successful tenure by Craig Kilborn, who had a more light-hearted approach. Stewart aimed to make the show more political and focused, with a focus on satire and criticism of the news media.\n\nThe show's format initially consisted of a mix of comedy and commentary on current events, often lampooning local news and the conventions of the time. The introduction of correspondent Stephen Colbert, known for his straight-faced humor, was a key addition, as he brought a new perspective to the show and helped shape its tone.\n\nDuring Stewart's tenure, there were conflicts with the original writers, who felt entitled and resistant to change. However, the hiring of writer Ben Karlin, who had a similar comedic sensibility, was instrumental in the show's evolution. The shift in focus under Stewart involved targeting more significant figures and issues, rather than just lampooning eccentric individuals.\n\nOne notable segment was when correspondent Stephen Colbert's character, a parody of an earnest news anchor, was criticized for potentially misrepresenting the show as not being on Comedy Central. This led to a reevaluation of the show's identity and the importance of its message.\n\nThe Daily Show's correspondents, including Steve Carell, were not professional journalists but instead used their characters to parody the media and political landscape. The show's coverage of the 1998-1999 political landscape, particularly with the rise of cable news networks like CNN and Fox News, demonstrated the show's ability to comment on the media's coverage and the saturation of political news.\n\nOverall, The Daily Show became a platform for political commentary and a source of satire, influencing the media landscape and shaping the way political humor was consumed by audiences.

{"pred": "The news articles cover groundbreaking discoveries in the field of archaeology, revealing the advanced tool-making and behavioral changes among early humans in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin. The research, published in Science, suggests that climate-driven shifts around 320,000 years ago led to the development of specialized tool-making and trading networks among a species, possibly Homo sapiens or a closely related species.\n\nThe oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, characterized by smaller, more refined stone tools, were found in the region, indicating a transition from the earlier Acheulean culture. These tools, including obsidian from distant locations, suggest the existence of long-distance trade and cooperation among early humans, possibly hinting at the development of a trading network.\n\nThe shift from the heavier, chopping hand axes to the smaller, specialized tools indicates a change in the environment, with frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions. This led to adaptations in tool-making and the potential for more diverse food acquisition, requiring creative thinking and resourcefulness.\n\nThe presence of obsidian, a rare material transported from distant areas, indicates the existence of trading networks and the exchange of goods, including pigments that may have had symbolic significance. This period, around 320,000 years ago, corresponds to the emergence of H. sapiens, suggesting that these behaviors and technological advancements were already present in the species.\n\nThe new discoveries challenge the concept of a \"human revolution\" that was previously believed to occur around 40,000-50,000 years ago, with evidence of modern behaviors and cultural traits found much earlier in the African Stone Age. This implies that the origins of modern human behaviors and complex thinking were likely present before the migration of Homo sapiens out of Africa.\n\nThe research highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between environmental changes and human adaptation, as well as the role of social networks in the success of early humans. It underscores the complexity of the African archaeological record and challenges the notion that modern behaviors emerged solely after the migration of Homo sapiens.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the presence of advanced tool-making and social interaction among early humans in the Olorgesailie Basin, dating back to 320,000 years ago, and the implications of these findings on the understanding of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors. The discovery of these tools and the evidence of trading networks suggests a more gradual and complex process than a sudden \"revolution,\" challenging the traditional narrative of human history.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

In Detroit, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) is carrying out a plan to disconnect water to thousands of non-paying customers, sparking protests and civil disobedience. About 50 activists demonstrated, with nine being arrested for blocking water trucks, as they believe the lack of water access for poor residents is a human rights violation. The DWSD has been accused of targeting households with young children, the disabled, and those with small delinquencies, while larger entities like golf courses and the state of Michigan, with larger debts, are not being affected.\n\n2. The situation has attracted international attention, with the United Nations panel calling the water shutoffs a violation of human rights. DWSD has announced a $1 million fund to assist struggling customers, but activists argue that the shutoffs will continue, leading to more protests.\n\n3. The city's water department, DWSD, is intensifying efforts to collect delinquent commercial accounts, which make up about 12% of the 90,000 delinquent accounts. DWSD's contractor is not equipped to handle commercial shut-offs, causing some businesses, like Vargo Golf, to be exempt from immediate shutdowns.\n\n4.

Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet (Google's parent company), received a $200 million equity award in February 2014, making him one of the highest-paid executives globally with a value of approximately $600 million in shares. The award consists of 273,328 Class C Google stock units, with a current value of $182 million.\n\n2. The equity grant brings Pichai's total equity stake in Alphabet to $650 million, but this is significantly less than the net worth of Google's founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and former CEO Eric Schmidt.

Despite losing the 1992 re-election to Bill Clinton due to a faltering economy and a conservative backlash, Bush's legacy has been reevaluated more favorably by historians. He was the last American president to serve in World War II and had a distinguished career in politics, including serving as vice president under Ronald Reagan and later as the 41st President himself.\n\nDuring his presidency, Bush faced challenges such as a recession and a tax increase, but his foreign policy achievements included a decisive victory in the Persian Gulf War and the unification of Germany.

Simpson's net worth, once $10.8 million, has been depleted by legal judgments and financial setbacks, including a $33.5 million civil settlement for the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. During his time in prison, Simpson has expressed remorse for the robbery and has been a model prisoner, hoping to continue his good behavior.\n\nSimpson's parole hearing is considered a formality, as the parole board typically announces its decision promptly. If parole is granted, he would be released from the Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada. Simpson's parole has sparked significant media attention, with many outlets preparing to cover the event. His friend and defense attorney, Tom Scotto, advises Simpson to avoid attracting unwanted attention and instead focus on rebuilding his life quietly.\n\nIn the past, Simpson's parole hearing in 2013 led to a five-year sentence reduction, and he has argued that he has been trying to make amends for the crime. However, his past criminal history, including the high-profile murder trial, continues to divide public opinion.

{"pred": "The recent discoveries in the field of planetary science have shed light on Mars' past, revealing a significant body of water that once covered a large portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. A study published in the journal Science indicates that a massive ancient ocean, comparable to Earth's Atlantic, covered nearly half of Mars' surface, with a volume of 20 million cubic kilometers, around 4.5 billion years ago. This ancient ocean, which was about 137 meters deep in some areas, suggests a more habitable environment for potential life.\n\nNASA scientists discovered that Mars had a global equivalent water layer with an unusually high D/H ratio, indicating a significant enrichment of deuterium, or heavy hydrogen. This enrichment, up to 8 times higher than Earth's ocean (8 VSMOW), implies that the planet had a global ocean that was at least 137 meters deep. The process of water loss on Mars, as seen by the increased concentration of deuterium, suggests that there was a vast amount of water, enough to create a global ocean, but it eventually evaporated and froze due to the planet's thinning atmosphere and cooling conditions.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient ocean challenges the conventional understanding of Mars' water history, as it was not just a sporadic presence but a significant feature during the planet's early days. The presence of this water, combined with the recent detection of methane on Mars by the Curiosity rover, fuels speculation about the possibility of past microbial life on the planet.\n\nHowever, the exact amount of water and the habitability of Mars remain a topic of debate. While the current data suggests a wetter Mars, the planet's current state with its cold and icy landscapes raises questions about the persistence of life. Further research, including the upcoming Exomars rover mission by the European Space Agency, aims to uncover more clues about the planet's past habitability.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

These sounds, which are low-throated \"coos\" or \"murmurs,\" were produced by a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch, which allows birds with large bodies to make these sounds. The study, published in the journal Evolution, suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations, or \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" evolved independently in birds and were not present in every lineage, with small-bodied birds not having this trait.\n\nSound designers for films like Jurassic Park used a variety of real and synthetic animal sounds to create the dinosaur noises. For instance, the raptors' hissing was based on goose noises, and the T. rex's roar was created by mixing in the sounds of a baby elephant. The researchers caution that the majority of dinosaur vocalizations, if they existed, would have been \"closed-mouth\" sounds, not the full-throated roars often portrayed.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations, or those made through the throat, are not common in all birds, with only large-bodied species exhibiting this behavior. This could imply that the presence of this vocalization was linked to specific behaviors, such as mating displays, which were more likely to occur in sexually selected species.\n\nThe study also suggests that the absence of this trait in small-bodied dinosaurs, like the majority of bird species, could be due to the difficulty in producing these sounds in their smaller anatomy. However, the researchers believe that the ability to produce closed-mouth sounds was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs, as it evolved independently in birds.\n\nWhile there is no direct fossil evidence of dinosaur vocalizations, the combination of closed-mouth sounds and the potential for these behaviors in dinosaurs, if they existed, adds a new layer to our understanding of these prehistoric creatures.

Bayesian techniques help refine the search by calculating probabilities for each point in the search area, accounting for factors like ocean currents and wind patterns. These probabilities are initially based on assumptions, such as a uniform distribution, but are updated as new information becomes available, like the possibility of a plane's communication systems being shut off, which shifts the focus to more likely locations.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian analysis was used to calculate the probability of finding the wreckage in specific areas, considering factors like the likelihood of the beacons working and the possibility of damage from the crash. The search for the missing plane has faced challenges due to the unpredictability of the ocean currents and the need to account for damaged equipment. Bayesian methods have been successful in past searches, but the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 case is more complex, with new evidence suggesting a deliberate act, which adjusts the probability distribution.\n\nNot all airlines or governments use Bayesian techniques in their search operations, and some experts argue that quantifying probabilities can sometimes obscure the uncertainty involved. However, Bayesian methods provide a flexible and adaptable approach, allowing searchers to incorporate new information and adjust their models as the search progresses.\n\nWhile the search for Flight 447 eventually led to the discovery of the wreckage, the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 remains challenging due to the lack of definitive evidence and the need to account for multiple scenarios.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The eclipse was visible from several regions, including Australia, the Pacific Ocean, and parts of Asia, Europe, and North America.\n\nThe moon, appearing as a Supermoon due to its proximity to Earth, was also a Blue Moon, a rare occurrence when two full moons in a month align. The eclipse began at 11:30 UT for a live session on the Virtual Telescope's website, and a total lunar eclipse rose above Rome, captivating audiences worldwide.\n\nA total lunar eclipse, or blood moon, occurs when the Earth blocks the sun's light, casting the moon in a reddish hue. The eclipse was visible from eastern Asia to western North America, with the moon's passage through the Earth's shadow creating a unique viewing experience.\n\nAstrophotographers from various locations, including Australia, the United States, and Italy, joined the Virtual Telescope team to capture stunning images of the event.

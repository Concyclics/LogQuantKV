{"pred": "Two recent studies, published by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, have revealed a surprising connection between cigarette smoke and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). These findings highlight the negative impact of smoking on the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in causing infections.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers discovered that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA by altering its cell walls. This resistance is achieved through the suppression of immune cells' ability to fight off the bacteria, as MRSA becomes less susceptible to the toxic substances produced by macrophages. The bacteria's resistance to antimicrobial peptides is also enhanced, allowing it to adhere better to human cells and survive for longer periods.\n\nThe second study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, found that e-cigarette smoke also has a similar effect, making MRSA more resistant and potentially more harmful. When exposed to cigarette smoke, MRSA became four times more resistant to macrophage killing and 10 times more resistant to surface changes that allow it to resist common immune defenses. This increased resistance persisted for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting a lasting impact on the bacteria.\n\nThe consequences of this heightened resistance are dire, as the smoke-exposed MRSA was more successful in invading mouse cells and causing mortality in experimental models. This highlights the potential for cigarette smoke to not only harm smokers but also aid in the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, contributing to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.\n\nThese findings emphasize the need for smokers to quit smoking not only for their own health but also to reduce the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can lead to life-threatening infections in hospitals and other healthcare settings. The researchers are calling for further investigation into the mechanisms behind this interaction and the development of alternative strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

The study aimed to investigate if Wikipedia's content was biased towards certain figures based on factors like gender, time, or location.\n\nThe research found that the majority of the most important historical figures on Wikipedia were born in western countries after the 17th century and were predominantly male. The algorithm used, Google's PageRank, was flawed when applied to Wikipedia, as it heavily favored Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist, due to his extensive presence in scientific classifications. Linnaeus' classification system, known as taxonomy, made him the subject of many Wikipedia pages, leading to a high ranking.\n\nTo address this issue, a modified version of PageRank, CheiRank, was employed, which considered the number of incoming and outgoing links.

The highest number of cases occurred in August-December 2014, with 120 cases reported, mostly affecting children under 21. The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it has been linked to viruses like polio and enteroviruses, including enterovirus D68.\n\nAFM symptoms include sudden weakness in the limbs, facial drooping, difficulty breathing, and speech problems. There is no specific cure for AFM, and treatment is often focused on managing symptoms and physical therapy. The CDC advises maintaining good hygiene, staying away from sick individuals, and cleaning surfaces to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nIn 2014, a significant outbreak of AFM was linked to the enterovirus D68, but the CDC has not detected the virus in all cases. Some cases have been reported in California, Massachusetts, and other states, and doctors are concerned about a repeat of the 2014 outbreak. Treatment options, such as intravenous immunoglobulin, have been suggested, but their effectiveness is not yet fully established.\n\nParents and families of affected children, like Carter Roberts and Laura Carson, have experienced the sudden onset of AFM, leaving them with questions about the cause and long-term effects. While the CDC continues to investigate, the best prevention is to maintain hygiene and be aware of the symptoms to seek medical attention promptly.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise in AFM cases in the US is a cause for concern, and the lack of a definitive cause raises uncertainty about the potential recurrence of the 2014 outbreak.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have found inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns on the cloth, suggesting they could not have been produced by a person lying on the fabric as it is commonly assumed. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and synthetic blood to simulate the wounds and analyze the flow patterns.\n\nThe researchers tested the bloodstains on the left hand, forearm, chest, and back, and found that the angles and patterns do not match those expected for a person on a cross, with rivulets on the hand being inconsistent with the 45-degree angle typically associated with a vertical wound. The blood from the spear wound also flowed differently than what would be expected, pointing to a standing model being used to create the patterns.\n\nThe investigation, which used bloodstain pattern analysis, contradicts previous radiocarbon dating results that placed the shroud within the range of 1260 to 1390 CE, indicating the cloth's age aligns with the Middle Ages. The researchers argue that the inconsistencies in the blood flow patterns indicate that the shroud may be a medieval representation, rather than a depiction of the actual crucifixion.\n\nWhile the investigation does not definitively prove the shroud's authenticity, it raises questions about the methods used to create the blood patterns and suggests that the shroud might not be a direct representation of the crucifixion as described in religious tradition.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

However, Bernthal never witnessed any of the sexual conduct allegations that have surfaced, including those involving sexual harassment and assault.\n\nKevin Spacey, the subject of these allegations, apologized for the incidents but denied them, stating that he doesn't remember the encounters with Anthony Rapp, who came forward with a claim of a 1986 encounter. Spacey's lawyer, Todd Rubenstein, did not return calls for comment. The actor faced numerous accusations from multiple men, including Roberto Cavazos, Justin Dawes, and others, who alleged sexual harassment, assault, or attempts to rape during their time working with him.\n\nSpacey's behavior on the sets of House of Cards, where he served as artistic director, was described by some as creating a toxic work environment. The series' final season on Netflix was cut short, with the network distancing itself from Spacey.\n\nThese allegations have led to a wave of similar claims against Spacey, with more than a dozen men coming forward to share their experiences.

Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

{"pred": "The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), a 2,650-mile hiking trail in California, Oregon, and Washington, has seen a surge in popularity due to the success of Cheryl Strayed's memoir \"Wild\" and the movie adaptation. The PCTA reports a 300% increase in inquiries and long-distance hiking permits since the publication of the book and the release of the film. This has led to concerns about overcrowding and the potential negative impact on the trail and local communities. In an effort to manage the growing number of hikers, the Pacific Crest Trail Association implemented a permit system with a daily quota of 50, limiting the number of hikers on the trail at any given time. This has helped to distribute the load and reduce environmental damage, but some argue that the current system may not be sufficient, as the number of hikers during peak season approaches the daily limit.\n\nWhile the PCTA's goal is to spread hikers and minimize overcrowding, the system faces challenges, as seen in the 2015 data, where approximately 1,200 hikers attempted the full 500-mile hike, and the current permit system has led to a more dispersed hiking season. The PCTA is also concerned about the potential for increased environmental impacts and financial costs, such as search and rescue operations.\n\nThe rise in female hikers, as suggested by Cheryl Strayed's experience, has also been noted, with a shift from fewer than 10% to around 30% of hikers being women. The PCTA has launched a campaign, #responsiblywild, to promote safety and \"leave no trace\" practices among hikers.\n\nAs the PCT faces the challenge of managing a growing number of hikers, the question remains whether a more formalized system, like the current permit system, is the best solution.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015.

The species, found in northeastern China, has been named for its rainbow-colored feathers, which are believed to have been used for both sexual attraction and potentially as a display feature. The fossilized dinosaur, with its head and chest adorned with rainbow-like structures, suggests the presence of microscopically structured melanosomes, similar to those found in hummingbirds, which create iridescent hues.\n\nCaihong is described as a small theropod dinosaur with a bird-like body, featuring feathered forelimbs and a unique configuration of feathers on its tail, which is similar to that of birds but lacks the ability to fly. Its long, slender hindlimbs and large, well-preserved feathers indicate it may have glided or flown short distances.\n\nThe study's authors, including evolutionary biologist Chad Eliason and paleontologist Xing Xu, discuss the significance of the discovery, suggesting that Caihong represents a more colorful Jurassic period, with its feathers potentially serving multiple functions beyond just flight. The dinosaur's fossilized feathers, along with its distinct head and tail features, provide insights into the evolution of feathers and their role in dinosaur behavior.\n\nThe article also highlights the use of advanced imaging techniques to analyze the nanostructures in the feathers, revealing them to be similar to those found in modern bird melanosomes.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial 1.75 cent per ounce soda tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding community projects, has faced significant backlash and is seen as a regressive measure that has led to decreased sales and a loss of revenue for the city. Former Mayor Ed Murray, who championed the tax, acknowledged its flaws and cited Cook County, Illinois' experience with a similar tax, which was repealed within two months. The tax has been criticized for not affecting low-income families, as it disproportionately impacts the poor, and has led to a shift in consumer behavior with many residents avoiding Seattle's stores to buy sugary beverages at lower-cost locations. Retailers like Costco have responded by posting price signs and directing customers to purchase outside the city, resulting in a decrease in sales for the city. The tax has been called regressive and has united diverse groups against it, including labor unions, businesses, and even some health advocates. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University suggests that Seattle's tax is among the most regressive in the country. While some argue that a tax on sugary beverages could have public health benefits, the immediate impact on sales and public opinion has been negative, with many residents and businesses opposing the tax. The tax's effectiveness in achieving its health goals and generating revenue is under scrutiny, with some cities like Spokane considering a statewide version of the tax, which could lead to similar consumer resistance and potential harm to local businesses.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The House has approved a bill to fund the government until December 15, with conditions including a one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and a rollback of the medical device tax. Senate Democrats, however, are refusing to accept changes to the ACA, and President Obama would likely veto any bill with these provisions. The Senate's options are limited, with a vote expected on Monday to avoid a shutdown, but the likelihood of passing a bill with the ACA changes is slim.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner is under pressure from conservative Republicans to push for a showdown over the ACA, believing it could provide a political victory for his party. The Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, has a different strategy, advocating for a strong stance against the ACA and demanding a complete cave-in from the House. If the House passes a clean funding bill, Senate Republicans might consider a short-term delay of the ACA, but this seems unlikely as the Senate leadership is confident they can defeat such an amendment.\n\nA shutdown could result in a government service interruption, affecting around 700,000 jobs in the Washington region, with an estimated daily loss of $200 million. The ACA, which is a key issue for both sides, is a sticking point, with neither the White House nor Democrats willing to budge without significant concessions. The House and Senate are expected to work on a short-term funding bill, but the passage of a bill without the ACA provisions is uncertain.\n\nAs the deadline approaches, both parties are blaming each other for the potential shutdown, with House Republicans calling for a shutdown to hurt Democrats politically, and Democrats insisting on a clean funding bill.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Neiman Marcus later acknowledged the breach and stated that they had no evidence of a connection to Target's data breach, which affected 40 million customers, including credit card numbers and personal information. The company offered free credit monitoring to affected customers.\n\nTarget, on the other hand, faced criticism for announcing the data breach late, after the holiday season, which led to a significant dip in sales. A 17-page report by a computer firm, iSight, filed to the US Secret Service, revealed that the Target breach was caused by malware that was inserted into point-of-sale systems. The report highlights the sophistication of the operation, with the source code indicating regions with advanced software coding capabilities, particularly in Eastern Europe and Brazil, where the malware has been used since at least 2009.\n\nBoth Neiman Marcus and Target were part of a larger, international hacking campaign that targeted multiple retailers. The report by the federal and private investigators linked the breaches to a sophisticated cybercriminal operation that subverted traditional security measures and operated covertly, using encryption to conceal the data theft.\n\nThese incidents have raised concerns about the potential for further such attacks, as the report suggests, due to the high rewards and low risk associated with POS (point-of-sale) hacking. The growing number of state attorneys general, including those from Connecticut, New York, and Illinois, are jointly investigating the breaches to determine if they are connected and to identify the source of the malware.\n\nIn summary, the Target and Neiman Marcus data breaches were part of a larger, international cybercrime campaign, with sophisticated malware being used to steal credit and debit card information. Both companies took different amounts of time to disclose the breaches, with Target announcing it sooner, while Neiman Marcus waited until after the holiday season.

The first lion, a 13-year-old named Mohawk, was killed by rangers after attacking a man who was part of a crowd surrounding the animal, despite attempts to tranquilize it failing due to the presence of a large crowd. The second lion, also a 13-year-old, was shot after it injured a motorcyclist, sparking outrage among locals who criticized the lack of alternative methods like tranquilization.\n\nMohawk, the popular lion known for his distinctive mane, had been cornered and attacked by a group of people, leading to his tragic death. The Kenyan wildlife service blamed the lack of a fence for the lion's escape and the subsequent killing. In contrast, South Africa's Sylvester, a lion that had escaped from a park, faced similar scrutiny, with wildlife officials considering both relocating or killing the animal based on the potential danger it posed to humans.\n\nThese incidents have highlighted the challenges of balancing conservation efforts with the need to protect human lives in densely populated areas. The escapes have led to discussions about the effectiveness of electric fences and the role of local communities in wildlife management.

The police found the baby in danger and took her to the hospital, where she is now in state custody. The case will be decided by a judge at the end of the summer, with a hearing scheduled for August 26th.\n\nIn the second story, a similar situation unfolded in Orlando, Florida, where a vegan mother, also named Sarah Markham, had her custody of her child, Caleb, restored after a judge ruled that she would need to provide a nutritionist's report within 10 days. Caleb was initially taken away from her due to concerns about his health, which led to a disagreement between the mother and a pediatrician. The court dismissed the claims of child abuse or neglect by the child protective services, and attorney Bo Markham, Caleb's grandfather, hopes the criminal case against his daughter will be dropped.\n\nBoth cases highlight the complexities of parental rights and the intersection of veganism and healthcare decisions, with the outcome depending on legal interpretation and medical advice.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products.

These findings challenge the traditional belief that colorectal cancer is mainly a disease affecting older individuals. According to the University of Michigan's study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the US was diagnosed below the age of 50, with younger patients being more likely to have advanced-stage tumors and require aggressive treatments like surgery. \n\nThe study by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute also showed that younger patients are more likely to receive radiation therapy for rectal cancer, despite having more aggressive disease at diagnosis. Despite these differences, younger patients had slightly better survival rates, particularly for localized tumors, but the study's authors recommend reconsideration of screening guidelines.\n\nResearchers from the University of Michigan and Harvard Medical School have suggested that a family history of colorectal cancer and certain risk factors should prompt younger individuals to start screening earlier, but there is debate about altering screening guidelines to begin at a younger age. Some experts, like Dr. David Weinberg, argue that the benefits of such a change might not outweigh the potential risks, while others, like Dr. Andrew Chan, suggest that more research is needed to determine the best approach.\n\nThe increase in colorectal cancer among younger patients is attributed to factors like smoking, obesity, and unhealthy diets, but the exact cause is unclear. Early detection through symptoms like blood in stool or changes in bowel habits is crucial, but doctors should also consider the possibility of colorectal cancer in younger patients without a family history.\n\nIn conclusion, while the rise in younger patients with colorectal cancer is a wake-up call, the decision to alter screening guidelines should be carefully evaluated considering the potential benefits and costs.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The discovery challenges the commonly held belief that humans migrated to the arid interior later, with the evidence suggesting that people were already adapting to the local climate and using key technologies like stone axes and ochre. The presence of bones from the extinct species Diprotodon optatum, along with burnt eggshells, indicates coexistence and potential hunting of megafauna by early humans.\n\nThe excavation process at Warratyi uncovered around 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, revealing a complex and diverse cultural landscape.

The first passage introduces a model proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, classifying civilizations into three levels (Type I, II, and III) based on their energy consumption. Type III civilizations, which harvest energy from all stars in their local galaxy, are particularly relevant to the topic. A recent paper by Dan Hooper suggests that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial to prevent the universe's expansion from isolating civilizations from their resources. Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations would expand their reach to secure stars before they become inaccessible due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nIn the context of space exploration, Hooper's paper implies that any advanced civilization would actively seek to capture and harvest stars, using Dyson spheres or similar structures to collect and utilize the energy of stars. These structures, such as Dyson spheres or satellite-based \"statites,\" would be necessary to harness the energy of stars that are far away and becoming inaccessible due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nThe paper also discusses the possibility of detecting advanced civilizations through the unique light signatures they might leave behind when harvesting stars. These signatures could be identified by observing the unusual galaxies that have lost their prime stars or by the increased radiation emitted by the energy-harvesting processes.\n\nThe mention of science fiction, like Olaf Stapledon's descriptions of energy-trapping structures, highlights the imaginative concepts that scientists and writers have explored in the realm of SETI. The focus on energy harvesting and the potential detection of alien civilizations underscores the urgency and importance of understanding the implications of the expanding universe.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the need for advanced civilizations to expand their reach and the potential for detecting them through unique energy signatures, as well as the concept of Dyson spheres as a means to harvest distant stars.

{"pred": "The news articles cover groundbreaking discoveries in the field of archaeology, revealing the advanced tool-making and behavioral changes among early humans in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin. The research suggests that climate-driven shifts in the region led to the development of specialized tool-making, including the use of obsidian from distant locations, indicating the existence of trading networks among early Homo sapiens or their relatives.\n\nThe oldest Middle Stone Age tools, dated around 320,000 years ago, were smaller and more finely crafted, reflecting the need for greater mobility and resource acquisition in changing environments. These tools, along with pigment applications, suggest a shift from scavenging to hunting and the potential for more complex social interactions and the exchange of resources over long distances.\n\nThe discovery of obsidian from up to 50 kilometers away from the excavation sites challenges the traditional narrative of a sudden \"human revolution\" for modern behaviors, as the technology and cultural practices appeared earlier than previously thought. The presence of Middle Stone Age tools and pigments suggests a more complex and interconnected society, with evidence of long-distance trade and cultural exchange.\n\nThe shift from the earlier Acheulean culture to the Middle Stone Age indicates a period of adaptation and innovation, potentially marking the beginning of Homo sapiens' evolutionary path. The new findings challenge the notion that \"modern behaviors\" emerged solely after the species left Africa, as some aspects of these behaviors were present in the region as early as 320,000 years ago.\n\nArchaeologists are emphasizing the importance of understanding the roots of these complex behaviors and the role of social networks in the development of early human societies. The discoveries suggest that the roots of modern human behavior and cultural advancements can be traced back to the African continent, challenging the conventional view of a \"human revolution\" occurring outside of Africa.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

He asserts that he has a license to carry a gun in New York and that he would defend himself with a gun if attacked. His comments were seen as a departure from his usual stance on gun control, drawing attention to his support for the Second Amendment.\n\nIn Passage 4, Trump attributes mass shootings to mental illness and dismisses the effectiveness of strict gun control laws. He defends his position by mentioning the perceived inefficiency of such measures. Trump also criticized President Obama's response to the shooting, and his tax plan, suggesting it could save money.\n\nOverall, the news highlights Trump's use of the shooting incident to advocate for gun rights and his belief in the importance of self-defense, while also touching on the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the campaign.

The author compares this to previous changes like the elimination of the CD drive and the 30-pin connector, suggesting that the lack of a technical excuse for removing the headphone jack is particularly absurd. They argue that wired audio often sounds better than wireless alternatives, such as Apple's proprietary AirPods, and that the company's choice to prioritize space and new features like stereo speakers and Taptic engines has led to the loss of functionality for iPhone users.\n\nThe author uses the hashtag #AppleEvent to highlight the absurdity of Schiller's explanation for the decision, comparing it to acts of courage in historical events. They point out that the lack of a universal audio standard, like the 3.5mm jack, means users can no longer charge their iPhone and use headphones simultaneously, leading to the suggestion of \"stupidity\" and \"arrogance.\"\n\nThe article also mentions the inconvenience and potential loss of expensive headphones with Apple's AirPods, as well as the potential for increased costs due to the need for Lightning-to-Aux cables. Some users, like Chris Taylor, have even joked about the impracticality of the AirPods and the risk of losing them.\n\nThe author concludes by lamenting the shift away from the \"it just works\" philosophy that once characterized Apple products, as the company now requires users to use their proprietary accessories, which adds cost and reduces compatibility.

{"pred": "The recent discoveries in the field of planetary science have shed light on Mars' past, revealing a significant body of water that once covered a large portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. A study published in the journal Science indicates that a massive ancient ocean, comparable to Earth's Atlantic, covered nearly half of Mars' surface, with a volume of 20 million cubic kilometers, around 4.5 billion years ago. The water was inferred from the planet's high concentration of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, in the Martian atmosphere, suggesting a global ocean that could reach depths of up to 137 meters, or 450 feet, if evenly distributed.\n\nNASA scientists have found that Mars had a global equivalent water layer that was enriched in deuterium, with some basins and depressions showing even higher enrichments. The study, using powerful telescopes, suggests that the planet's water was lost over time due to the leakage of hydrogen into space, leaving behind a water-rich environment that could have been conducive to life. The presence of a global ocean on Mars challenges the previous understanding of the planet's water dynamics, as it was believed that water on Mars was scarce and intermittent.\n\nIn addition to these findings, Mars may have had a more habitable history than previously thought, with a warm and wet climate that supported the existence of liquid water for a prolonged period. The search for life on Mars is gaining momentum, with the European Space Agency's upcoming Exomars rover planned to investigate the planet's potential habitability in 2018.\n\nHowever, the exact amount of water on Mars and the possibility of life are still subjects of debate among scientists, with some suggesting that the current estimates might underestimate the true water content due to the planet's early atmosphere being rich in heavy hydrogen. Despite these uncertainties, the growing evidence points to Mars having had a more extensive and potentially habitable past than previously imagined.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The court's decision means that the European Union's trademark office must reconsider Nestlé's claim, potentially preserving the KitKat's shape as a recognizable feature without it being protected as a trademark across the entire European Union. The ruling has implications for other brands operating in the EU, as it highlights the need for proof that a specific design is distinctive in all member states.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long thought to roar with the ferocity of movie monsters, might have sounded more like birds, according to new research. The study published in the journal Evolution argues that the ancient reptiles, known as archosaurs, primarily used \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" which are low-throat sounds similar to those of modern birds. These sounds, unlike the high-pitched chirps of birds with open mouths, are produced by a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch. The researchers found that a significant portion of birds, particularly those with large bodies, have this closed-mouth vocalization, suggesting it evolved separately in different groups of animals.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the Jurassic Park movie, shared that the sounds of the dinosaurs were created by blending real animal noises. For instance, the raptors' hissing was inspired by a goose's angry squawks, and the T. rex's roar was a combination of a horse's sound and a slowed-down baby elephant's. The study also revealed that dinosaurs like the T. rex might have had a bird-like ability to produce low-pitched sounds through their esophageal pouches, but without fossil evidence, scientists cannot confirm this for all dinosaurs.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations, which are sounds produced through a closed beak, are not common in birds, but they are present in a minority of species, particularly in large-bodied ones. This suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalizations might have been present in some extinct non-avian dinosaurs, possibly for sexually selected vocal displays.\n\nThe evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and crocodiles indicates that it can occur independently, as seen in the variety of species that exhibit this behavior. This behavior, however, is not universal among birds, with small-bodied species lacking it. The study's lead author, Chad Eliason, believes that the association with large bodies is due to the physics of vocalizing, as the pressure required for closed-mouth sounds increases with body size.\n\nWhile dinosaurs like T. rex might have had a similar vocal capacity, the lack of direct fossil evidence leaves the specifics of dinosaur vocalizations uncertain. The research highlights the mystery surrounding dinosaur sounds and the potential for dinosaurs to have had unique vocalizations, similar to the variety found in birds.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers matched specific brain patterns with visual content, enabling them to reconstruct the videos from the subjects' thoughts.\n\nThe study involved subjects lying motionless in an MRI machine, watching movie trailers, while their brain activity was recorded. The computer algorithm then learned to associate specific brain patterns with visual elements, successfully reconstructing the videos when the subjects watched the same trailers again.

The search for MH370, however, presents additional complexities due to the new evidence suggesting a deliberate act, which affects the probability distribution. Bayesian methods are not universally adopted, and critics argue that the method may not be suitable for drastic changes in the situation, as it relies on the assumption that the plane might not be in the initial search area.\n\nDespite the challenges, Bayesian techniques provide a flexible and adaptable approach, allowing searchers to incorporate new information and adjust their models as needed.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

The couple, both founders of the Apotex pharmaceutical company, had been looking forward to a holiday in Florida, but instead, their friends and the police are investigating the possibility of a murder-suicide. Initial theories suggested that the husband may have killed his wife before taking his own life, but the couple's grown children denied this, stating that their parents were devoted to their family and community.\n\nThe investigation is being handled by the homicide squad, and while the police have not ruled out suicide, they are not yet calling it a homicide.

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country is undergoing significant political and social changes following the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. Egyptians recently voted in the third phase of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its gains. The trial of Mubarak, now in his 83-year-old state, has resumed, with prosecutor Moustafa Suleiman accusing him of tyranny and oppression. The prosecution argues that Mubarak's rule was marked by corruption and the suppression of dissent, leading to the deaths of protesters.\n\nThe ongoing political landscape is marked by tensions between the military council, the Brotherhood, and liberal factions. The new parliament's role in the transition is uncertain, with economic challenges, including slowing growth and a declining foreign currency reserve, affecting daily life. The election results are expected to shape the composition of the new parliament, with Islamists, particularly the Brotherhood, expected to gain a significant presence.\n\nMubarak's trial, which resumed after a two-month break, has garnered attention for the prosecutor's assertion that Mubarak should face \"the harshest penalty.\" The trial's outcome and the formation of a new government are key issues, with the military council's authority over the interim government being a point of contention.\n\nThe election process has also revealed divisions within the political spectrum, with the Brotherhood maintaining a cautious stance towards potential alliances, while the ultra-conservative Islamists, represented by the Salafi parties, have gained ground. The upcoming anniversary of the uprising, on January 25th, is expected to further fuel protests demanding an end to military rule.\n\nIn summary, Egypt's political transition is complex, with the military council, Islamists, and liberal factions vying for power, while the trial of Mubarak serves as a reminder of the accountability for past actions. The new parliament's role and the eventual transition to a civilian government are key uncertainties in the country's ongoing transition.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

{"pred": "Two recent studies, published by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, have revealed a surprising connection between cigarette smoke and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). These findings highlight the negative impact of smoking on the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in causing infections.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers discovered that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA by altering its cell walls. This change in the bacteria's structure allows it to better withstand the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species, which are typically used by the immune system to fight off infections. The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing, and its resistance to antimicrobial peptides increased as well.\n\nThe second study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, also found that e-cigarette vapor, although not as potent as cigarette smoke, still has a similar effect on MRSA, making it more resistant and increasing its ability to invade human cells. Crotty Alexander's team observed that the bacteria's resistance persisted for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting a potential for long-term persistence and transmission.\n\nThese findings emphasize the role of cigarette smoke in fueling the growth and resistance of MRSA, highlighting the need for smokers to be aware of the additional risk they face due to this interaction. The researchers suggest that understanding this link could contribute to the development of new strategies to combat antibiotic-resistant infections, as well as potentially influencing public health campaigns to discourage smoking.\n\nIn summary, cigarette smoke acts as a catalyst, making MRSA more resistant and harmful, and the increased resistance observed in MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke could have significant implications for the spread and treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections. Both cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor can alter the bacteria's cell walls, but cigarette smoke appears to have a more pronounced effect, making it a crucial factor to consider in the battle against antibiotic-resistant超级细菌.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

Researchers from Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences have used blood flow analysis to examine the bloodstains on the cloth, and their findings indicate that the patterns are inconsistent with a person being crucified, as depicted on the shroud.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions of the wounds, such as the hand, forearm, and wounds on the back. The researchers found that the blood flow angles on the shroud do not match those expected for a person hanging from a cross, with rivulets on the hand and the chest not aligning with the 45-degree angle typically associated with a vertical wound. The analysis, particularly of the \"blood belt\" around the waist, showed that the blood flow is inconsistent, pointing to a standing model rather than a corpse being the source of the bloodstains.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the Shroud's blood patterns are not consistent with the crucifixion scenario, suggesting that the cloth may have been created through an artistic or \"didactic\" representation from the 14th century. While the Vatican has not officially weighed in on the authenticity of the shroud, this new forensic evidence challenges the idea that it is the actual burial cloth of Jesus.\n\nIn summary, the Shroud of Turin's bloodstain analysis supports the notion that the cloth might be a medieval forgery, casting doubt on its claimed connection to the crucifixion of Jesus.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

This small dinosaur, about the size of a crow, lived during the Jurassic Period in China and is the first of its kind to have rainbow-colored feathers. The feathers, with their unique four-barbule structure, are believed to have been used for both sexual attraction and possibly for communication, similar to modern birds. The fossilized dinosaur, which had a bird-like head and hindlimbs but lacked the ability to fly, had feathered tails that were similar to those of Archaeopteryx, the earliest known bird.\n\nCaihong's feathers were found to have distinctively arranged, narrow barbs that create a symmetrical vaning pattern on the tail, similar to those seen in birds. The study also revealed nanostructures in the fossilized feathers that are structurally similar to melanosomes found in modern bird feathers, suggesting that the dinosaur's feathers were likely pigmented in a rainbow-like manner.\n\nThe significance of these iridescent feathers lies in their potential role in communication and possibly sexual selection, as seen in modern birds. The dinosaur's unique combination of feather characteristics, including its asymmetrical tail feathers, challenges the traditional understanding of feather evolution and suggests that the ability to produce iridescent colors may have been present in early paravians, hinting at a more colorful Jurassic world.\n\nThe study's authors, including paleontologists from the University of Texas at Austin and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, emphasize the importance of further research to understand the function and evolution of these feathers in Caihong and other feathered dinosaurs.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial 1.75 cent per ounce soda tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding community projects, has faced significant backlash and is seen as a burden on both consumers and businesses. Former Mayor Ed Murray, who championed the tax, now admits it may not have achieved its intended goals and has been criticized for its regressiveness and negative impacts on low-income families. The tax has led to a significant increase in the price of sugary beverages, with some retailers like Costco redirecting customers to neighboring areas to avoid the higher prices. The tax has also sparked public protests and a decrease in sales, with some retailers seeing drops of up to 38% in beverage sales. The tax has been called regressive and has united diverse groups against it, including labor unions, businesses, and even some health advocates. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University suggests that Seattle's tax is among the most regressive in the country. While some argue that a tax could potentially encourage healthier choices, the negative consequences, such as reduced sales and customer migration to neighboring areas, have proven to be substantial. The tax's effectiveness in achieving its health goals and revenue targets has been called into question. Meanwhile, a proposed soda tax in Spokane, Washington, is being reintroduced as a bill, raising concerns among local businesses about potential price hikes and potential harm to their bottom lines. The situation highlights the challenge of implementing and the mixed results of soda taxes in attempting to change consumer behavior and generate revenue.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Compassion Over Killing alleged that these actions violated Virginia state animal protection laws and called for accountability from Tyson Foods.\n\nTyson promptly fired 10 workers involved in the incidents and announced the discontinuation of \"boning\" at the affected facilities.

The incident has sparked concerns among animal rights activists and led to calls for Tyson to be held responsible for the mistreatment.\n\nIn response to the video, Tyson is conducting additional training for its employees and has pledged to review its animal welfare procedures. The company has also faced similar allegations in the past, with other animal rights groups documenting similar abuses. The recent video has prompted the company to discontinue beak modification, a controversial practice that some believed contributed to the mistreatment.\n\nThis case highlights the ongoing debate about animal welfare in the poultry industry and the push for more humane methods of killing and slaughter.

Michael Cohen, Trump's campaign aide, questioned the validity of polls showing Trump trailing Hillary Clinton, repeating the phrase \"Says who?\" when anchor Brianna Keilar pointed out that Trump's campaign was down in the polls. Cohen's disbelief in the polls' accuracy sparked a humorous exchange with CNN.\n\n2. Cohen's comment about the \"African American problem\" in the US, as mentioned by Cohen himself, was seen as an attempt to clarify that Trump, despite his claim of being color-blind, acknowledged the racial tensions in the country. His response to the poll question was met with skepticism from CNN's audience.\n\n3. The hiring of Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon as key campaign figures was seen by some as a shake-up, but Cohen defended the move, stating it was not a \"shake-up\" but rather a \"great move\" that the campaign was now ready for. Cohen's response to the \"Says who?\" question was met with further inquiries from CNN's Keilar, highlighting the confusion surrounding the campaign's performance.\n\n4. The interview on CNN generated significant attention online, with the hashtag #SaysWho trending on Twitter.

The breach was later confirmed to involve the theft of customer information, with the company issuing notifications to affected customers and stating that no Social Security numbers or birth dates were compromised. Neiman Marcus faced criticism for not disclosing the incident earlier, but the company defended its decision, stating that it waited for confirmation before announcing the breach.\n\nTarget, on the other hand, suffered a larger-scale data breach that affected 40 million credit and debit card accounts, in addition to potential exposure of personal information such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. Target initially notified customers about the breach within days, unlike Neiman Marcus, which came under scrutiny for not doing so until after Christmas. The investigation into the Target attack revealed that it was part of a broader, international effort, with the malware used being unique and innovative in its ability to evade detection.\n\nA 17-page report by computer firm iSight, filed to the US Secret Service, provided further insights into the Target breach, describing the malware used and its regions of origin. The report highlights the sophistication of the operation and the use of software coding from countries like Russia and Brazil, where memory scraping capabilities have been available for some time. This suggests that the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches were likely connected to a larger, coordinated cybercrime campaign.\n\nBoth retailers have faced criticism for the delay in reporting the incidents, with Target's prompt response helping to mitigate the impact on their business. Law enforcement agencies, including the US government, are currently investigating the possible connections between these breaches and other similar attacks, as they examine the source of the malware and the motivations behind these large-scale data thefts.\n\nIn summary, the Neiman Marcus and Target breaches were part of a larger, sophisticated cybercrime campaign targeting multiple retailers. While Neiman Marcus delayed disclosure, Target acted swiftly, and both companies are offering credit monitoring services to affected customers. The ongoing investigation aims to uncover the source of the malware and the extent of the connections between the breaches.", "answers": ["It looks like the hackers that hit Target had lots of other, well, targets.

The second lion, Mohawk, a popular tourist attraction in Nairobi National Park, was also killed by KWS rangers due to the perceived threat to human life, despite attempts to tranquilize him.\n\nMohawk's death sparked outrage among locals and social media users, with many questioning the decision to kill the lion without attempting to capture and relocate it. In South Africa, a different lion, Sylvester, was also in the spotlight after escaping from a park, sparking debates about whether to kill or capture the animal, depending on the perceived danger it posed.\n\nThe incidents have raised questions about the effectiveness of wildlife management in Kenya, particularly in the case of the lack of tranquilization equipment and the impact of urbanization on the lions' natural habitat. The situation in Nairobi National Park, with its growing human population, has led to more frequent escapes of lions like Mohawk and Sylvester. Conservationists and park officials are grappling with the challenge of preserving lions while ensuring the safety of local communities.\n\nIn both cases, the decision to kill the lions was seen as a last resort, with the primary concern being the potential threat to human lives. The incidents have reignited discussions about the need for better infrastructure, such as improved electric fences, to prevent lions from straying and the need for more effective methods of capturing and relocating escaped animals.

She was charged with child neglect after a doctor advised her that the baby needed medical attention, but Markham refused to follow the doctor's orders and instead brought a soy-based formula from Whole Foods. The police were alerted by a tip and found the baby in poor health, leading to the intervention. The baby has since been taken into state custody and Markham faces a court hearing in August to determine her future custody arrangements.\n\nIn the second story, a similar situation occurred in Orlando, Florida, where a judge ruled that a mother, also named Sarah Markham, would regain custody of her child, Caleb, after he was taken away due to concerns about his weight and health. Caleb's father, Bo Markham, and their attorney, Bo Markham, expressed relief that there was no evidence of abuse or neglect, as the judge threw out the original claim by the Seminole County Child Protective Services. The child's grandfather hopes that the criminal case against the mother will also be dropped.\n\nBoth cases highlight the complexities of parenting in today's society, with some parents choosing alternative diets and beliefs that can conflict with medical advice.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products.

These findings challenge the traditional belief that colorectal cancer is primarily a disease affecting older individuals. According to the University of Michigan's study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the US was younger than 50, with a higher likelihood of advanced-stage tumors and more aggressive treatments for these patients.\n\nThe study by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute found that younger patients, especially those diagnosed before age 50, were more likely to have regional or distant malignancies, which are more dangerous than localized tumors. Treatment patterns for younger patients were also different, with a higher likelihood of surgery for younger rectal cancer patients and more radiation therapy for those with distant metastases.\n\nDespite the advanced stage at diagnosis, younger patients had slightly better survival rates, with a 5-year survival rate of 95% for localized tumors, 76% for regional, and 21% for distant diseases. However, the study's limitations, including lack of family history data, could influence these findings.\n\nThe rise in younger colorectal cancer patients has sparked discussions about whether screening guidelines should be revised to start at an earlier age. While some experts argue that the impact on reducing cancer deaths might be limited, others, like Harvard's Andrew Chan, caution against changing the screening recommendations due to the low risk for this age group.\n\nThe study's findings emphasize the need for improved risk assessment and awareness of early symptoms, such as blood in stool, among younger patients. As the number of younger colorectal cancer survivors increases, the focus shifts to providing long-term support for their physical and emotional well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the growing incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients necessitates further research to determine if and how screening guidelines should be adjusted, considering the potential benefits and costs involved.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The Warratyi rock shelter, located in the Flinders Ranges, has been dated to around 49,000 years, making it one of the oldest human settlements in the country. The site's discovery, made during a survey for an aboriginal elder, was prompted by a man going to the toilet, leading to the discovery of a rock shelter with evidence of human activity, including blackened roofs indicating fire-making and the presence of burnt eggshells, which date back to 45,000 to 49,000 years ago.\n\nThe site's significance lies in the presence of sophisticated tools, such as bone fragments from the largest ever found marsupial, and the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and Southeast Asia. These findings suggest that humans, rather than climate change, were likely responsible for the extinction of megafauna, as evidenced by the discovery of bones from the extinct species, Diprotodon optatum, and the presence of their remains in the site.\n\nThe excavation process at Warratyi was meticulous, with a combination of techniques used to preserve and analyze the artifacts, including optical dating of quartz grains and radiocarbon analysis of organic remains. The site's location in the arid interior of Australia challenges the commonly held belief that the climate barrier prevented early humans from moving south.\n\nThe discovery of the Warratyi rock shelter challenges the timeline of human migration into the region, pushing it back 5,000 years earlier than previously thought. This finding supports the theory that modern Aboriginal Australians, with their advanced technologies and ability to adapt to the harsh environment, were present in the region much earlier than previously believed.\n\nThe presence of burnt eggshells and the interaction with megafauna, such as the extinct Genyornis, suggests a complex coexistence between humans and these ancient animals. The study underscores the ingenuity and adaptability of early humans in Australia, challenging the notion that they were solely driven by environmental factors.\n\nThe research at Warratyi adds to the growing body of evidence that challenges the traditional narrative of a linear, coastal-to-interior migration, suggesting a more complex and diverse pattern of human settlement. The findings have implications for our understanding of the early interactions between humans and the environment in Australia, and the role of indigenous cultures in shaping the continent's history.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

{"pred": "The three news passages discuss various aspects of advanced civilizations, energy expansion, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). The first passage introduces a model of galactic expansion proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, dividing civilizations into three types (Level I, II, and III) based on their energy consumption. Type III civilizations, which harvest energy from all stars in their local galaxy, are suggested to be the most advanced and potentially capable of securing star systems before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe's accelerated expansion caused by dark energy.\n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds a new perspective to this idea. Hooper argues that harvesting energy from distant stars is not only necessary for increasing a civilization's resources but also the key to avoiding the universe's expansion, which would render those stars unobservable. He proposes that advanced civilizations, aware of the expanding universe's limitations, would attempt to capture and harvest stars before they become inaccessible.\n\nThe paper suggests that advanced civilizations might create Dyson spheres, massive structures made of millions of satellites, to harness the energy of their stars. These satellites, called statites, could either be in orbit or form a ring around the star, collecting and beaming energy back to the home planet. The search for intelligent life, or Type III civilizations, would involve looking for unusual galaxy signatures, such as the absence of normal starlight and the presence of peculiar energy signatures.\n\nThe second passage mentions that the Internet Archive's WARC Zone contains uploaded WARCs, which are not necessarily part of the Wayback Machine but serve as a reference for researchers and the general public. These WARC files could potentially shed light on the history of websites.\n\nThe third passage refers to the concept of ancient extraterrestrial civilizations, which might have created Dyson spheres to harness immense amounts of energy.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The research, published in Science, suggests that climate-driven shifts around 320,000 years ago led to the development of specialized tool-making and trading networks among a species, possibly Homo sapiens or a closely related species.\n\nThe oldest Middle Stone Age tools, characterized by smaller, more refined tools, were found to date back to around 320,000 years ago, indicating a sudden transition from the earlier Acheulean tools. These tools, made from obsidian sourced from distant locations, suggest the existence of long-distance trading networks among hominid populations. The presence of red pigment, possibly used for signaling or status, further supports the idea of cultural complexity and social interaction.\n\nThe shift from the earlier Acheulean technology to the Middle Stone Age tools indicates a period of adaptation and innovation, as the environment became more unpredictable with changing landscapes. This could have driven hominids to develop new techniques and expand their foraging ranges, potentially leading to the diversification of food sources and the emergence of specialized tools.\n\nThe new findings challenge the traditional concept of a \"human revolution\" that was believed to occur around 40,000-50,000 years ago, suggesting that modern behaviors like symbolism, innovation, and art were present in the African Stone Age much earlier than previously thought. The shift in tool-making and the discovery of red pigment hint at a more complex social network and the exchange of resources, echoing the practices of modern hunter-gatherer groups.\n\nThe researchers argue that the Olorgesailie evidence supports the idea that these behaviors and technological advancements were not a sudden event but rather a gradual process, with multiple hominin groups adapting to changing environments and developing more sophisticated techniques. This understanding challenges the notion that \"modernity\" emerged solely after Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the remarkable adaptability and creativity of early humans in the region, demonstrating that complex behaviors and technological innovations occurred much earlier than previously believed, around 320,000 years ago, and were likely driven by environmental pressures and the need for cooperation and resource exchange. These findings challenge the traditional narrative of a sudden \"human revolution\" and suggest a more nuanced understanding of the evolution of human cognition and culture.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet (Google's parent company), received a $200 million equity award in February 2014, making him one of the highest-paid executives globally with a value of 273,328 Class C Google stock units. His equity stake in Alphabet now stands at $650 million, but this is still significantly lower than the net worth of Google's founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\n2. The equity grant, worth $199 million at the time, is a significant portion of Pichai's total compensation, although it's not the largest among US CEOs. In 2011, Apple awarded its then-CEO, Tim Cook, a $376 million grant, which was more than Pichai's current package.\n\n3. Pichai's share in Alphabet's equity value rises to $650 million, but it falls short of the net worth of former CEO Eric Schmidt, who holds a significant amount of shares, and the $130 million tax settlement Google agreed to pay the UK government, which critics argue is a fraction of the company's potential tax liability.\n\n4. Other Google executives, such as CFO Ruth Porat and former head of Google Cloud, Diane Greene, also received substantial equity awards, adding to Pichai's $650 million equity stake.\n\nIn essence, these articles discuss Pichai's substantial equity award, his relatively low position in the company's wealth hierarchy compared to the founders, and the company's tax dealings and executive compensation.

The bill, which received final approval in the lower house of parliament, makes possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana a petty offense, with no criminal record attached. This move is aimed at reducing the island's reliance on illegal drug trafficking and addressing the island's long-standing issue with marijuana, which has been deeply ingrained in culture and spirituality.\n\nThe legislation establishes a cannabis licensing authority to oversee the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. Rastafarians, known for their religious use of the plant, will now be legally allowed to use marijuana for these purposes. Tourists with medical prescriptions will also be able to obtain permits to purchase small amounts of marijuana for personal use.\n\nHowever, the government emphasizes that it will not loosen its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. National Security Minister Peter Bunting stated that the law does not create a \"free-for-all\" in drug activities, and the security forces will continue to enforce international treaty obligations.\n\nThe move is seen as a potential boost for the island's economy, with hopes that Jamaica can become a player in the medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the development of cannabis-based products.

A study published in the journal Science indicates that a massive ancient ocean, comparable to Earth's Atlantic, covered nearly half of Mars' surface, with a depth of up to a mile, and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water. This ancient ocean, which persisted around 4.5 billion years ago, was a result of the detection of a high concentration of deuterium, or heavy hydrogen, in the Martian atmosphere.\n\nNASA scientists used powerful telescopes to analyze the Martian atmosphere and discovered that the planet's water had a global equivalent water layer that was enriched in deuterium, with an average enrichment of about 8 times Earth's standard (VSMOW) value. This high D/H ratio suggests that Mars had a global ocean that was at least 137 meters deep, equivalent to 137 meters of water covering the entire planet. The process of water loss over time, as indicated by the increased deuterium concentration, indicates that Mars had a much wetter past than it is now.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient ocean challenges the previous understanding of Mars' water presence, which was previously believed to be sporadic and insufficient for creating long-lasting bodies of water. The presence of such a large body of water on Mars raises the possibility that the planet may have had a more habitable environment in its youth, fostering the idea that life could have existed there.\n\nIn addition to the ancient ocean, Mars is also being explored for signs of life, with the detection of methane on Mars by the Curiosity rover sparking speculation. However, the exact origin of the methane is not yet attributed to life, as it can also be produced by geological processes.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

Nestlé's attempt to protect the unique shape of the KitKat, known as \"four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base,\" was rejected by the court. This decision comes after a long legal battle between Nestlé and rival US company Mondelez, who owned the rights to the KitKat brand. The ruling means the EU's trademark office must reconsider Nestlé's trademark, potentially allowing for a change in the product's protected status.\n\nThe case highlights the complexities of trademark laws within the European Union, as the court found that Nestlé had not proven the shape's distinctiveness in every EU country. This judgment could affect other similar products, such as Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which has a similar shape but is not protected due to its different flavor and history. The outcome leaves the possibility for either company to appeal further, depending on the evidence presented by the EU trademark office.\n\nTheKitKat's EU trademark is not the only one in question, as other brands, like Toblerone, have faced similar challenges.

This ruling underscores the ongoing legal battles surrounding brand protection in the European market, with some Brexit supporters using it as an example of the EU's perceived failure to defend domestic brands.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long thought to roar with the ferocity of their movie counterparts, may have sounded more like birds than you'd imagine. A new study reveals that the ancient reptiles, including the iconic T. rex, likely produced \"closed-mouth vocalizations\" like those of pigeons or cooing ostriches, rather than the high-pitched screams often associated with their size and power. These sounds, which are low-throated \"whooshes,\" were produced by a combination of animal noises, such as the hiss of a goose and the hoots of birds.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the Jurassic Park movie, explained that creating the sounds for the dinosaurs involved mixing real animal noises with manipulated ones to create a realistic but otherworldly effect. For instance, the raptors' hissing was inspired by a goose's angry squawks, and the T. rex's roar was based on baby elephant sounds slowed down to emphasize its size.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations, which are unique to certain bird species, are believed to have evolved independently in birds and may have been present in extinct dinosaurs as well. The study, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, suggests that large-bodied birds, like doves and ostriches, are more likely to exhibit this type of vocalization, as it requires a specific physical mechanism to produce these sounds.\n\nThe lack of fossil evidence for dinosaur vocalizations means our understanding of their sounds is largely speculative, but the connection to closed-mouthed bird sounds hints at a possible link between extinct and living dinosaurs. The evolution of this vocal behavior, which involves air being pushed through a skin-filled cavity, challenges the traditional image of dinosaurs as fierce, roaring beasts.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of dinosaur vocalizations resembling those of birds challenges our preconceived notions of their roars and underscores the diversity of vocal behaviors in the animal kingdom.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time. They changed their findings, and presto, the plane was found.

Here's a summary of the key events and findings:\n\n1. State Department officials, including then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were initially concerned about the potential impact of Marines wearing uniforms on diplomacy in the region, particularly in the context of the Benghazi attack. The report reveals that the focus of the meeting on September 11, 2012, was more on understanding the attack and its causes rather than immediate evacuation plans.\n\n2. The final House Benghazi report, authored by the majority, confirms that the administration intentionally misled the public about the attack's nature, with officials using a \"false narrative\" that the violence was a response to an inflammatory video, despite evidence to the contrary. The report also highlights internal disagreements within the administration about the role of the video in the violence.\n\n3. The report by Rep. Elijah Cummings and Mike Pompeo, the ranking Democrat and a co-author, disputes the Benghazi Select Committee's findings, stating that the investigation was \"partisan\" and that the committee was prevented from accessing crucial information. They argue that the report's conclusions do not change the understanding of the attack's facts.\n\n4. The report itself, with 800 pages, reveals that the Benghazi attack was initially classified as a terrorist act, but the administration's public statements continued to emphasize the role of a video as the cause, even after intelligence assessments changed.\n\n5. The report by the Benghazi Select Committee, led by Trey Gowdy, criticizes former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her team for not properly addressing the growing extremism in Libya, which the committee believes contributed to the attack. The report's release comes with a Democratic rebuttal, highlighting the lack of transparency and the focus on politicizing the situation.\n\nIn summary, the Benghazi attack was a complex and politically charged event, with the administration initially misleading the public about the cause and subsequently facing criticism for not fully acknowledging the role of terrorism. The House Select Committee's investigation, led by both parties, has been criticized for its partisanship and the limited access to information, with the final report reinforcing the administration's missteps and the need for a more accurate narrative.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises. Not in an ideal viewing area? The Virtual Telescope plans to livestream the total eclipse from Australia, which you can watch here, per Quartz.

A new global study published in the Lancet journal reveals that obesity is a growing problem worldwide, affecting both rich and poor nations, with no country seeing a decline in obesity rates in the past three decades. The study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, highlights the alarming fact that almost 30% of the world's population is either overweight or obese, with 2.1 billion individuals affected.\n\nThe United States, despite having a smaller portion of its population, accounts for the largest number of obese individuals globally, with 13% of the population. However, obesity rates are increasing in both developed and developing countries, with some countries experiencing staggering increases, such as 58% in the Middle East and North Africa, and 65% in adult women in Oman.\n\nThe rise in obesity is linked to factors like increased availability of cheap, high-calorie, processed foods and sedentary lifestyles. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that obesity is a major contributor to diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. The study's authors note that there is no country that has successfully reduced obesity rates, indicating a global challenge.\n\nWhile obesity rates are escalating in many parts of the world, there is a slight improvement in rich countries, where obesity increases in adults have slowed. However, this is accompanied by a worrying rise in obesity in children and adolescents.

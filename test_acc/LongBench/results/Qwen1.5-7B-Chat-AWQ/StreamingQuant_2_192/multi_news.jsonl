{"pred": "Two recent studies, published by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, have revealed a surprising connection between cigarette smoke and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). These findings highlight the negative impact of smoking on the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and enhancing its ability to cause infections.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers discovered that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA by altering its cell walls. This change in the bacteria's structure allows it to better resist the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species, which are typically used by the immune system to fight off infections. The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing and 10 times more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, both key components of the immune response.\n\nThe second study, published in the same journal, investigated the effects of e-cigarette vapor on MRSA. While e-cigarette smoke also made the bacteria more resistant, the researchers observed a higher resistance increase with cigarette smoke compared to e-cigarette vapor. Cigarette smoke exposure led to a significant increase in MRSA's ability to survive and invade human cells, as well as its resistance to mouse models.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke acts as a \"warning signal\" to MRSA, making it more resilient and less susceptible to standard treatments. The persistence of the increased resistance even after exposure highlights the potential for the bacteria to adapt and become even more dangerous. The researchers caution that this could contribute to the increased risk of infections in smokers and emphasize the importance of quitting smoking to reduce the risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as MRSA.\n\nIn summary, the new research reveals a complex interplay between cigarette smoke and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, where the smoke not only harms the host but also aids in the survival and aggression of MRSA, making it a significant concern for public health. The studies emphasize the need for further investigation into alternative methods to combat antibiotic resistance, as well as promoting smoking cessation to prevent the spread of these resistant strains.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The majority of cases occurred in children under 21, with the average age being 7.6 years. AFM causes muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and can lead to severe complications like paralysis. The exact cause of AFM is unknown, but it has been linked to viruses like enteroviruses and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. There is no specific cure, but treatments like physical therapy and in some cases, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) have been suggested to help with recovery.\n\nEnterovirus D68, a strain associated with AFM, was detected in some cases but not in all, indicating that other factors may contribute to the disease. The symptoms include sudden weakness in limbs, facial drooping, and difficulty breathing. The CDC advises maintaining good hygiene, avoiding sick individuals, and reporting any suspected cases to healthcare providers.\n\nIn 2014, a significant outbreak of AFM coincided with an enterovirus D68 outbreak, raising concerns that the same virus might be responsible for the current rise. Parents and healthcare professionals are urged to be vigilant and report any suspected cases to the CDC. Treatment options are limited, but early intervention and rehabilitation are crucial for recovery.\n\nParents like Robin Roberts, whose child Carter was diagnosed with AFM, express frustration about the lack of information about the condition. While some children have shown partial recovery, the long-term effects and the rarity of the illness make it a challenging situation for affected families.

Researchers from Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences have used blood flow analysis to examine the bloodstains on the cloth, and their findings indicate that the patterns are inconsistent with a person being crucified, as depicted on the shroud.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions of the body, such as standing, supine, and those seen on the shroud. The researchers found that the blood flow on the hands, particularly, does not match the angles observed on the shroud, suggesting a standing model was used to create the patterns. The discrepancies include variations in angles and the lack of a consistent flow, which is unexpected for a crucified individual.\n\nOne significant finding was the rivulets on the hand, which were only consistent with an arm held at a 45-degree angle, not the 80-100-degree range suggested by the shroud's position. The simulated spear wound also showed a different pattern than the one on the shroud, with rivulets not resembling a solid stain.\n\nThese inconsistencies in the blood patterns point to the conclusion that the shroud's bloodstains are not consistent with the crucifixion wounds, leading the investigators to suggest that the blood on the cloth may have been applied by a model or artist, rather than coming directly from a crucified body. While the Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, the results cast doubt on its authenticity and raise questions about the methods used to create the blood patterns.\n\nThe researchers note that further study is needed to account for the possibility of multiple blood flows and the effects of cleaning the body, which could explain the inconsistencies.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Despite their experience, they chose to traverse the mountain's west face, known for its steep inclines and loose rocks. Mr. Wilson, who was using his phone, heard his wife's exclamation and realized her fall after she had gone down about 20-30 feet. Despite his attempt to help, he stayed on a safer ledge and called for assistance. The rescue team found her body over 150 meters down, and the coroner concluded the death as accidental due to the combination of factors, including the unsuitability of the terrain for the type of footwear they wore and the reliance on the app, which may not have provided a clear enough route.\n\nPassage 2:\nChris Lloyd, a member of the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team, described the route the couple took as \"not a straightforward path\" and mentioned that the incident was not uncommon on Tryfan, accounting for around 30% of the team's incidents. The coroner, John Gittins, recommended caution for first-time climbers, suggesting they consider going with an experienced guide or using traditional methods like maps and compasses in addition to electronic navigation.\n\nPassage 3:\nAn inquest heard that Jane Wilson, a fit and active mountain walker, had been using her smartphone app to find a route when she fell and died. The decision to traverse the west face of Tryfan, despite the risks, led to her accident. The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death, attributing the incident to the lack of proper guidance from the app and the challenging terrain.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the dangers of relying solely on smartphone apps for mountain navigation, as it led to the fatal fall of Jane Wilson. The incident serves as a reminder to hikers to use a combination of map and electronic aids, especially in rough terrain, and to exercise caution when navigating unfamiliar routes.", "answers": ["A hiker's fatal fall in March has been blamed on using a smartphone app map instead of an actual map.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial 1.75 cent per ounce soda tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding community projects, has faced significant backlash and is seen as a burden on both consumers and businesses. Former Mayor Ed Murray, who championed the tax, now admits it may not have achieved its intended goals. The tax has led to a dramatic increase in the price of sugary beverages, with some products seeing a 64% rise, causing consumers to seek alternatives and retailers to report decreased sales. The tax has been criticized for being regressive, hitting low-income families harder, and for not targeting all sugary drinks, like those sold at Starbucks. Some retailers, like Costco, have posted signs to direct customers to nearby locations where the tax is not applied, resulting in a decrease in sales for Seattle. The tax has also sparked public protests and legal challenges, with some arguing that it is a regressive tax and has led to a loss of revenue for the city. A similar tax in Philadelphia was repealed after a similar public backlash. The tax's effectiveness in promoting health is questioned, with some arguing that it may not have the desired behavioral changes and could be seen as a burden on consumers and local businesses. A proposed tax in Spokane, Washington, is being reintroduced, raising concerns among some about potential negative impacts on local retailers and consumer behavior.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The White House and Democratic leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Schumer, are united in their refusal to make concessions on the ACA, arguing that the onus is on Republicans to pass a clean funding bill to avoid a shutdown.\n\nAs the deadline looms, Senate Majority Leader Reid has been a key player in pushing for a tough Democratic strategy, insisting that the House Republicans must accept the consequences of a shutdown. The potential shutdown could have far-reaching economic consequences, with local economies in the Washington region, particularly in Virginia and Maryland, expected to suffer significant losses due to the loss of federal workers and the halt in services.\n\nIn the end, the negotiations are focused on finding a compromise that would allow the government to reopen while either delaying the ACA or addressing the ACA's funding. The White House and Democratic leaders are determined to hold firm on their position, believing that a shutdown would ultimately force Republicans to back down and accept the ACA's continued funding. However, the political landscape remains fluid, and the outcome of the showdown is uncertain.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The spacecraft, originally known as Solar Probe Plus, will now bear Parker's name, marking the first time a spacecraft has been named for a living scientist. Parker's work, which involved predicting a high-speed solar wind, has been crucial for understanding the sun's atmosphere and the acceleration of solar wind. The probe, set to reach within 3.9 million miles of the sun's surface, aims to unravel the mysteries of the sun's corona, including its high temperature and the acceleration of solar wind. The mission will involve seven close flybys of the sun, with the spacecraft's instruments protected by a heat shield and a thermal protection system. The Parker Solar Probe is expected to provide valuable insights into the sun's behavior, solar wind, and its impact on Earth, including the potential for severe space weather events that can disrupt power grids and satellite systems. The renaming of the mission highlights the significant contribution of Parker's work to space science.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

The breach resulted in the theft of customer information, with Neiman Marcus stating that some customers' payment card information may have been compromised but not their sensitive personal data like Social Security numbers.\n\nTarget, on the other hand, suffered a larger-scale attack that affected 40 million customers, in addition to the potential compromise of 70 million people's personal information. The breach involved the theft of credit and debit card data, as well as encrypted PINs, and was linked to a malware attack that used innovative tactics to conceal its activities. The iSight report, filed to the US Secret Service, highlights the sophistication of the operation, linking it to regions with advanced software coding capabilities, particularly in Eastern Europe and Brazil.\n\nBoth Neiman Marcus and Target were targeted by a coordinated cybercriminal effort, with Neiman's investigation revealing that the attack was ongoing until January 1st, a day after the company decided to disclose the breach. Target, however, notified its customers about the data breach much faster, potentially impacting their sales during the holiday season.\n\nThe report from the investigation into the Target breach indicates that it was part of a broader, international campaign, suggesting that these attacks were connected and possibly part of a larger, more extensive plan by a sophisticated group.

Dr. Sripal Bangalore, a researcher at NYU Langone Medical Center, emphasizes the importance of maintaining weight stability for heart health.\n\nPassage 2 explains that coronary artery disease, caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries, can lead to reduced blood flow to the heart, potentially causing chest pain and heart attacks. It advises a healthy lifestyle as a preventive measure against the disease.\n\nPassage 3 presents a new study that reveals the detrimental consequences of yo-yo dieting for individuals with coronary heart disease. The study, led by Dr. Bangalore, found that large fluctuations in weight were associated with a 124% increase in the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and deaths. This is in contrast to those who maintained a stable weight, with the risk being 117% higher for heart attacks and 136% higher for strokes.\n\nThese findings emphasize the need for a long-term, stable weight management strategy for people with pre-existing heart conditions, as yo-yo dieting could exacerbate their health risks. While the connection between yo-yo dieting and heart health is not definitively proven, the study's authors and experts caution against weight fluctuations, suggesting the need for further research and potential interventions to promote healthier weight management.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the potential dangers of yo-yo dieting for individuals with coronary artery disease, linking it to a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and deaths.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

{"pred": "A significant increase in colorectal cancer cases among younger patients, particularly those under 50, has been revealed by a series of recent studies. These findings challenge the traditional belief that colorectal cancer is primarily a disease affecting older individuals. According to the University of Michigan's study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the US was younger than 50, with a higher likelihood of advanced-stage tumors and more aggressive treatments for these patients.\n\nThe study by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute found that younger patients, especially those diagnosed before age 50, are more likely to have distant malignancies, which are more aggressive but have a higher five-year survival rate compared to localized tumors. However, when diagnosed, younger patients tend to have more advanced disease, leading to a higher risk of recurrence despite receiving more aggressive treatments.\n\nResearchers suggest that the medical community should be more proactive in identifying colorectal cancer in younger patients, as the study's findings indicate that nearly 15% of patients could be missed if screening starts at 50. While some experts argue that changing screening guidelines might not be necessary, others, like Harvard Medical School's Andrew Chan, note that the increased incidence of colon cancer among younger adults could be linked to environmental factors like smoking, obesity, and unhealthy diets.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, acknowledges the need for further research to determine if changing screening guidelines would be beneficial. Meanwhile, doctors are encouraged to be vigilant for early warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as blood in the stool, and to consider risk factors for younger patients who might need to start screening earlier than the current recommendation.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients necessitates a reevaluation of screening guidelines and a focus on improving risk assessment and awareness, but the impact on reducing mortality through earlier screening remains uncertain.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The Warratyi rock shelter, located in the Flinders Ranges, has been dated to around 49,000 years, making it one of the oldest human settlements in the arid interior of the continent. The site's discovery, made during a survey for an aboriginal elder, was serendipitous when a man going to the toilet uncovered the area. The shelter's blackened roof indicated the presence of fire, a key indicator of human activity.\n\nExcavations at Warratyi uncovered a wealth of artifacts, including sophisticated tools, bone fragments, and evidence of ochre use, which pushes back the timeline for the development of key technological advancements in Australia. The site also holds the first reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna, specifically the extinct species Diprotodon optatum. The presence of bones from these megafauna, along with burnt eggshells, suggests coexistence and possibly even interaction between humans and these animals.\n\nThe findings challenge the commonly held belief that humans entered the arid interior of Australia later, as the evidence suggests a rapid expansion from coastal regions. The site's location, about 550 km from Adelaide, implies that people were able to move quickly across the country, despite the challenging environment. The use of ochre, a pigment used for artistic and possibly functional purposes, further supports the idea of local innovation.\n\nThe study also highlights the ingenuity of the ancient inhabitants, as they were able to create and utilize these technologies without the need for a coastal origin. However, there is ongoing debate about the exact age of certain artifacts, with some estimates differing slightly. The discovery of Warratyi underscores the diversity and adaptability of Indigenous Australians, who have been living in the region for at least 49,000 years.\n\nOverall, the Warratyi rock shelter and its associated artifacts provide crucial insights into the early colonization and technological advancements of Australia, challenging the conventional timeline and highlighting the indigenous ingenuity and interaction with the environment.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "The news revolves around Tesla's CEO Elon Musk's surprise announcement of a potential private buyout of the company, causing significant reactions in the market and raising legal and financial concerns. Here's a summary of the key developments:\n\n1. Tesla's board members, including Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, and others, released a statement confirming that they had discussed the idea with Musk last week. The board has been evaluating the proposal, particularly focusing on how a private company might better serve Tesla's long-term interests.\n\n2. The statement from the board members does not confirm that Musk has secured the necessary funding for the $420-per-share offer, leaving the question of whether the board believes the deal is feasible and backed by sufficient resources.\n\n3. The timing of the announcement has raised eyebrows, as it came after Tesla's 10-Q filing with the SEC, which typically discloses significant events. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly looking into the matter.\n\n4. Musk's decision to announce the buyout on Twitter without first informing the board or the market has raised questions about the process and potential legality. Some board members, like venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson, have distanced themselves from the statement.\n\n5. The proposed buyout, valued at $72 billion, would be the largest in history, surpassing the TXU Corp. acquisition in 2007. However, the lack of transparency and the suddenness of the announcement have sparked concerns.\n\n6. The board's response, while acknowledging the discussion, does not provide details on their evaluation of the proposal. It's unclear if the directors are satisfied with the plan or if they believe the method used by Musk was appropriate.\n\n7. The announcement has caused Tesla's stock to surge, but the uncertainty surrounding the buyout has led to a drop in value and questions about the deal's legality.\n\n8. The Securities and Exchange Commission is likely to investigate the situation, as the timing and lack of a formal announcement raise concerns about potential insider trading.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the complexity and uncertainty surrounding Musk's proposed buyout, with the board and the market questioning the feasibility of the deal and the process followed by Musk.

{"pred": "The three news passages discuss various aspects of advanced civilizations, energy expansion, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). The first passage introduces a model of galactic expansion proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, dividing civilizations into three types (Level I, II, and III) based on their energy consumption. Type III civilizations, which harvest energy from all stars in their local galaxy, are suggested to be the most advanced and potentially capable of securing star energy before it becomes inaccessible due to the expanding universe's accelerated expansion caused by dark energy. A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds that such civilizations would actively expand to secure star energy by capturing and harvesting stars before they are beyond reach.\n\nHooper's paper proposes that advanced civilizations would understand the importance of capturing stars early to avoid the \"horizon problem\" where stars beyond their local group become unobservable due to the expansion of the universe. To harvest energy from distant stars, he suggests using Dyson spheres, which are massive, energy-harvesting structures made of millions of individual satellites, or \"solar sails\" that collect and beam energy back to a planet.\n\nThe second passage is a reference to the Internet Archive's WARC Zone, which contains uploaded WARCs that may or may not be part of the Wayback Machine. These are stored for reference and analysis by the team.\n\nThe third passage mentions the concept of advanced alien civilizations, particularly Type III civilizations, which could create Dyson spheres to harness the energy of their galaxy. These structures, if real, would be massive and require a significant amount of material, but they could potentially provide a stable source of energy for a civilization.\n\nIn summary, the main theme of these news articles revolves around the idea of advanced civilizations expanding their energy sources to overcome the limitations imposed by the expanding universe and the potential detection of such civilizations through unique light signatures or the search for evidence of Dyson spheres in the sky. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is intertwined with the understanding of the universe's expansion and the implications for advanced civilizations' strategies to maximize energy usage.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

{"pred": "The news articles cover groundbreaking discoveries in the field of archaeology, revealing the advanced tool-making and behavioral changes among early humans in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin. The research, published in Science, suggests that climate-driven shifts around 320,000 years ago led to the development of specialized tool-making and trading networks among a species, possibly Homo sapiens or a closely related species.\n\nThe oldest Middle Stone Age tools, characterized by smaller, more refined tools, were found to date back to around 320,000 years ago, indicating a sudden transition from the earlier Acheulean tools. These tools, made from obsidian sourced from distant locations, suggest the existence of long-distance trading networks among hominid populations. The presence of red pigment, possibly used for signaling or status, further supports the idea of cultural complexity and social interaction.\n\nThe shift from the earlier Acheulean technology to the Middle Stone Age tools indicates a period of innovation and adaptation to changing environments. The researchers propose that the regular shifts between wet and dry conditions drove these changes, forcing early humans to become more mobile and develop specialized tools for different tasks.\n\nThe Olorgesailie tools, particularly the obsidian, indicate the presence of trading networks, as they were transported from distant locations. This suggests that early humans, around 320,000 years ago, were not only adapting to their environment but also engaging in complex social interactions and the exchange of resources.\n\nThe new findings challenge the traditional concept of a \"human revolution\" that was believed to occur around 40,000-50,000 years ago, suggesting that modern behaviors like symbolism, innovation, and art were present in Africa much earlier than previously thought. The study highlights the importance of considering the entire African archaeological record and the role of climate change in shaping human evolution.\n\nIn summary, the research reveals a more complex picture of early human history, with advanced tool-making, trading, and cultural practices occurring earlier than previously acknowledged. These findings support the idea that human societies were adapting and evolving in response to environmental changes, fostering the development of social networks and potentially contributing to the emergence of modern human behaviors.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

{"pred": "The recent discoveries in the field of planetary science have shed light on Mars' past, revealing a significant body of water that once covered a large portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. A study published in the journal Science indicates that a massive ancient ocean, comparable to Earth's Atlantic, covered nearly half of Mars' surface, with a depth of up to a mile, and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water. This ancient ocean, which persisted around 4.5 billion years ago, was a key factor in the planet's potential for supporting life, as it provided a habitable environment with warm temperatures and liquid water.\n\nNASA scientists used powerful telescopes to analyze the Martian atmosphere and discovered a high concentration of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, indicating a global water loss of about 137 meters deep. This led to the estimation that the planet had a global ocean, with the water being enriched in deuterium, up to 8 times more than Earth's ocean (8 VSMOW). The concentration of deuterium suggests that Mars had a significant amount of water, enough to create a global ocean, but the exact amount was likely much greater due to the planet's unique hydrogen-to-deuterium ratio.\n\nThese findings challenge previous assumptions about Mars' water presence, as the planet's water may have been more consistent and stable than previously thought. The discovery of a global ocean on Mars raises questions about the planet's habitability and the possibility of past life, reigniting interest in the search for extraterrestrial life on the Red Planet.\n\nIn addition to the ancient ocean, Mars is also experiencing ongoing water loss through the escape of hydrogen into space, which has led to a higher proportion of deuterium in the remaining water. This suggests that Mars may have had a more extensive water history than previously believed, providing a more habitable environment for a longer period.\n\nAs the search for life on Mars continues, these findings have implications for the potential habitability of the planet and the possibility that Mars could have supported life in its distant past. However, the exact amount of water and the likelihood of life remain subjects of ongoing research and debate among scientists.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long thought to roar with the ferocity of their movie counterparts, may have sounded more like birds than you'd imagine. A new study reveals that the ancient reptiles, including the iconic T. rex, likely produced \"closed-mouth vocalizations\" like those of doves or pigeons, rather than the high-pitched screams often associated with their size and power. These sounds, which are low-throated \"coos\" or \"murmurs,\" were produced by a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch, which allows birds with large bodies to make these sounds. The study, published in the journal Evolution, suggests that closed-mouth vocalization, a unique trait in birds, evolved independently in at least 16 different animal lineages, including birds and crocodiles.\n\nSound designers for movies like Jurassic Park, like Gary Rydstrom, used a combination of real animal sounds and creative editing to create the dinosaur noises. For instance, the raptors' hissing was based on goose noises, and the T. rex's roar was a mix of baby elephant sounds slowed down to create a more menacing effect. The sounds of dinosaurs, particularly the raptors, were likely more akin to the cooing of a dove or a goose's hissing, rather than the thunderous roars often portrayed.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations, which are unique to certain bird species, are not common in small-bodied birds but are more prevalent in larger ones. This implies that the presence of such a vocalization in dinosaurs, if they had it, could have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, similar to how it evolved in birds.\n\nThe study highlights the diversity of vocalizations among dinosaurs and birds, suggesting that the ability to produce these sounds may have been a trait that evolved separately in different lineages. While direct fossil evidence for dinosaur vocalizations is lacking, the findings challenge our preconceived notions of these extinct creatures' sounds.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of dinosaur vocalizations resembling those of birds challenges our understanding of these extinct creatures and opens up new avenues for research into their communication methods.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

They have developed a technique that can read and recreate a person's brain activity during the viewing of YouTube videos, creating a surreal, continuous reconstruction of the content. This is the first time scientists have been able to map dynamic visual experiences directly to the brain, a step towards \"reading\" our minds without visual stimulation.\n\nThe study involved subjects lying still in an MRI machine, with their brain activity monitored as they watched movie trailers. By analyzing the patterns of blood flow in the visual cortex, the researchers were able to create a computer algorithm that linked specific brain patterns to visual elements in the videos. When the subjects watched the same trailers again, the algorithm generated a reconstructed video based on their brain activity, resulting in a continuous, albeit blurry, representation of their visual experience.\n\nThis technology has the potential to delve into the realm of dreams and thoughts, as it could potentially reveal what's happening inside a person's mind without visual input. The researchers believe it could one day provide insights into a person's thoughts and memories, although the clarity and resolution of the reconstructed images are still limited by current technology.\n\nThe study's lead author, Shinji Nishimoto, emphasizes the importance of understanding the brain's natural visual processing for the technology's wider applicability. While the technology could potentially be used to reconstruct imagery, it's important to note that it's still a long way from being able to read a person's dreams or memories, as the nature and reliability of those memories may vary.\n\nIn summary, this groundbreaking research opens up possibilities for decoding visual experiences and could pave the way for applications in fields like neuroscience and assistive technologies for individuals with paralysis, but ethical considerations and the accuracy of reconstructed memories remain crucial questions.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

Bayesian techniques help refine the search by calculating probabilities for each point in the area, updating these probabilities based on factors like flight paths, ocean currents, and damage to the plane's communication devices. The search for the missing plane involves considering multiple scenarios, such as a deliberate diversion, which affects the probability distribution of the plane's location.\n\nIn the Air France case, Bayesian statistics combined with expert judgment led to the successful recovery of the wreckage, despite challenges due to unpredictable ocean currents. The current search for MH370 faces additional complexities, as the focus shifts from the initial search area based on new information suggesting a deliberate act and the need to account for all possible scenarios.\n\nBayesian methods, however, can be limited in adapting to drastic changes in the situation, as highlighted by statistician Brad Efron. This is because the technique relies on a gradual refinement of prior knowledge, which may not be suitable when the situation changes significantly, as in the case of MH370. The search for the missing plane has been marked by difficulties in determining the plane's location and the possibility of a crash caused by human error, which adds to the complexity of Bayesian calculations.\n\nWhile Bayesian methods have been used in the search, critics argue that they may not be the best fit for the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 case, as the situation could be too complex for the plane's whereabouts.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is still investigating the incident, which resulted in the death of the driver, Walter Huang, an Apple engineer. The car was on Autopilot at the time of the accident, with the driver having received warnings about the system's operation before the collision.\n\nAccording to Tesla's statement, the car's Autopilot was engaged with adaptive cruise control set to minimum distance, and the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds before the accident. The severity of the crash was attributed to the damaged crash attenuator, which had not been replaced after a previous accident. This particular model of Tesla had never experienced such extensive damage in any other crash.\n\nTesla has emphasized that Autopilot, while not preventing all accidents, significantly reduces the risk of fatalities. They claim that since the introduction of Autopilot, there have been 1.25 million miles driven with the system, resulting in one fatality for every 320 million miles driven by Tesla vehicles, compared to the national average of one fatality per 86 million miles for all vehicles.\n\nThe Huang family shared that Walter had complained to Tesla about the Autopilot veering towards the same barrier multiple times before the fatal crash, but the company couldn't replicate the issue at the dealership. The California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) acknowledged the need to repair the damaged barrier, stating that replacement work was scheduled but could be delayed due to weather conditions.\n\nThis incident has sparked discussions about the accuracy of public perception regarding Autopilot's safety and the importance of understanding that the system does not eliminate all accidents but significantly decreases their likelihood. Tesla continues to improve its systems, with recent updates aimed at enhancing reliability.\n\nOther related news includes a fatal Tesla crash in Mountain View, where the vehicle was engulfed in flames, and a separate incident involving an Uber autonomous vehicle in Arizona, which led to the suspension of the company's testing on public roads.

His dedication to pleasing kids, often going to great lengths to erase his identity for their entertainment, earned him a special place in the hearts of his generation. Williams' transition into serious projects later in his career was hindered by the decline of mid-budget adult dramas, but his impact remained strong through the films he chose to work on, which became cherished memories for many.\n\nIn his early days, Williams was discovered as a stand-up comedian and made a lasting impression with his unique and captivating performances. One such instance was when he performed at the Comedy Store, leaving a lasting impact with his show and a prediction of the fame that was about to engulf him. Despite his fame, Williams remained humble and down-to-earth, often denying the potential for public attention to affect his everyday life.\n\nWilliams' legacy extends beyond his comedic prowess, as his ability to connect with children and their emotions resonated deeply. From the innocence in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" to the complex characters he portrayed, Williams' work was driven by a desire to please and understand the audience's perspective.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "On Wednesday evening, a car driven by Nabila Altahan, a passenger in the vehicle, experienced a near-catastrophic incident in Mendon, a town near Sugar & Spice Restaurant. The incident occurred when the driver, following a GPS unit's sudden instructions, reacted too quickly to a turn and ended up suspending the car from a telephone guy wire instead of turning around. The car, a Toyota Corolla, was in the process of leaving the road on Route 4 when the GPS system directed a U-turn due to the vehicle having already passed its intended destination.\n\nState Police reported that no one was injured in the accident, with Altahan and her passenger escaping unharmed. The car was not structurally damaged, and the driver, who had jumped out of the vehicle, was witnessed by a passerby, Ray Ault, who was driving nearby. Emergency services, including the State Police and Rutland City Fire Department, promptly arrived at the scene to handle the unusual situation.\n\nIn summary, a driver's overreaction to a GPS instruction led to a near-miss incident where a car was temporarily suspended from a telephone pole in Mendon, but no one was hurt, and the situation was quickly resolved by emergency responders. This incident serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of trusting road signs and common sense in driving, rather than solely relying on GPS technology.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP. Police say 30-year-old Nabila Altahan of Dorchester, Mass., was headed west on US Route 4 when she passed her intended destination and reacted quickly to the instructions, leaving the road at a significant enough speed to propel the vehicle up the wires. She wasn't injured. (This driver followed her GPS into a lake.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 310}

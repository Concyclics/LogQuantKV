These findings highlight the negative impact of smoking on the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in causing infections.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers discovered that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA by altering its cell walls. This resistance is due to the bacteria's ability to resist toxic substances, such as reactive oxygen species, which are produced by immune cells to combat infections. The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing and became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, both key components of the immune system's defense.\n\nThe second study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, also revealed that e-cigarette smoke, although not as potent as cigarette smoke, also has a similar effect on MRSA. E-cigarette vapor also makes the bacteria more resistant and less susceptible to being killed by the immune system. This increased resistance persisted for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that the bacteria could pass on these traits to subsequent generations.\n\nThese findings have significant implications for public health, as they suggest that cigarette smoking not only harms the smoker but also aids in the survival and proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA. The researchers emphasize the need for smokers to quit to reduce their risk of not only lung diseases but also infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nBoth studies contribute to the growing body of evidence linking environmental factors like smoking to the spread and persistence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, emphasizing the importance of understanding and addressing these interactions in the fight against superbugs.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions and angles of the wounds.\n\nThe bloodstain analysis revealed that the patterns on the shroud do not match those expected from a person hanging crucified, with rivulets on the hand and the arm not aligning with the reported 45-degree angle. The researchers found that the blood flow on the shroud is inconsistent, with angles varying from 45 degrees to over 100 degrees, which is not consistent with the supposed position of the body during crucifixion.\n\nThe investigation supports the idea that the bloodstains on the shroud may have been created by a standing model, casting doubt on the traditional belief that the image was transferred through the body of Jesus. This finding, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, raises questions about the Shroud's authenticity and calls for further examination.\n\nWhile the Vatican, which regards the shroud as an icon, has not officially weighed in on its authenticity, this new forensic analysis adds to the ongoing debate surrounding the object's origins and the techniques used in its creation.

Rowling, which aims to close down child institutions and raise awareness about the plight of 8 million children worldwide who are living in such institutions. The founder, Ashleigh Mulheir, shares a personal experience that motivated her to start Lumos after seeing a photograph that triggered her initial reluctance to confront the issue. The majority of these children are not orphans but are placed in institutions due to poverty, lack of education and healthcare, or due to their parents' inability to care for them.\n\nLumos's mission is to shed light on these situations and advocate for the rights of these children. The article reveals that the majority of these children are not in abusive or neglectful institutions but rather in poorly resourced ones, and the problem can be addressed through investment in education, healthcare, and family-based care alternatives.\n\nThe founder's personal commitment to the cause, as demonstrated by her presidency of Lumos, has led to significant progress in reducing the number of children in institutions. In countries like Moldova and the Czech Republic, where Lumos has worked, there has been a significant decrease in the number of children in institutions, highlighting the effectiveness of their approach.\n\nThe article also emphasizes that the issue of child institutionalization is not just a moral concern but also a cost-effective solution, as it reduces the long-term negative impacts on children's development and supports their integration into families and communities. The launch of the #Letstalklumos campaign on social media further raises awareness and encourages public engagement in the fight against this practice.\n\nIn conclusion, Lumos's work and the global commitment from donors, including the EU and the US, show that ending the harmful practice of institutionalization for children is achievable and has a positive economic impact. The organization's goal is to eradicate institutionalized children by 2050, and their success stories serve as a testament to the potential for change.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

This small dinosaur, found in northeastern China, had rainbow-colored feathers on its head, neck, and chest, with a distinct crest, and was likely a predator hunting small mammals and lizards. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, suggests that Caihong represents a more colorful Jurassic period, with its feathers containing microscopically similar structures to those of hummingbirds. The feathers' pigmentation, as revealed by SEM analysis, indicates the presence of melanosomes, supporting the idea that these structures are melanosomes, not bacterial remnants.\n\nCaihong's unique feature is its feathered head and neck, with a large, narrow, and short ulna and radius, which is a characteristic seen only in birds and some scansoriopterygids. Its feathered tail, with large, frond-like structures, is similar to those of Archaeopteryx and other early birds, suggesting a possible role in aerodynamics.\n\nThe dinosaur's fossilized feathers, along with its small body size and elongated forelimbs, resemble those of birds but with a distinctively short, broad ischium, which hints at a possible function unrelated to flight. The researchers propose that the iridescence might have served as a sexual or social signal, similar to modern birds.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of feather coloration in understanding dinosaur behavior and evolution, with Caihong juji being the oldest known dinosaur with asymmetrical feathers on its tail, a trait seen in birds but not in other dinosaurs at the time.\n\nThis discovery challenges the traditional understanding of dinosaur feather diversity and provides insights into the evolution of feather patterns and their potential roles in dinosaur behavior and communication.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

Her husband, Gary, raised the alarm and was eventually rescued by the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team, but it was too late to save her life. The coroner's conclusion was accidental death.\n\nPassage 2 highlights the cautionary tale provided by Chris Lloyd, a member of the rescue team, and Andy Simpson, a spokesperson for Mountain Rescue England and Wales. They emphasize the importance of using a combination of maps and electronic navigation tools, especially in mountainous areas. They suggest that the couple's decision to use a smartphone app alone led to the misjudged route, which could have been avoided by using a traditional map or joining a more familiar path.\n\nPassage 3 summarizes the inquest's findings, recording a conclusion of accidental death and highlighting the need for caution when using technology for navigation. The coroner, John Gittins, mentioned that the夫妇's attempt to navigate through a less conventional route, despite the risks, contributed to the accident. The incident serves as a reminder for hikers to use maps and compasses in addition to electronic devices, as electronic navigation tools may not always provide the same level of detail and could potentially lead to misjudged routes.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the dangers of relying solely on smartphone apps for mountain navigation, resulting in the tragic death of a woman. It underscores the importance of using multiple navigation methods, such as maps and compasses, especially in challenging terrain. The incident serves as a cautionary tale for hikers and emphasizes the importance of being cautious when using technology in the wilderness.", "answers": ["A hiker's fatal fall in March has been blamed on using a smartphone app map instead of an actual map.

A detective says the app map \"would have been small and not as detailed\" and took the couple on a route that was not the safest.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial 1.75 cent per ounce soda tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding community projects, has faced significant backlash and is now causing economic harm to the city. The tax has led to a 64% increase in the cost of a $15.99 case of Gatorade, with retailers like Costco directing customers to nearby locations to avoid the tax. Opponents argue that the tax is regressive, hurting low-income families and businesses, and does not effectively target health concerns. A study from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University suggests that Seattle's tax is among the most regressive and unpopular in the country, with similar measures in Philadelphia and Cook County, Illinois, experiencing similar declines in sales and customer shifts to neighboring areas. The tax has also sparked public protests and legal challenges, with some retailers and groups like the Illinois Retail Merchants Association opposing its impact on small businesses. While the tax was initially defended as a public health measure, its implementation has resulted in decreased sales and a loss of revenue for Seattle. The situation has led to calls for a review or potential repeal of the tax, as well as concerns about the effectiveness and fairness of such regressive policies.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The spacecraft, originally known as Solar Probe Plus, will now bear Parker's name, marking the first time a spacecraft has been named for a living scientist. Parker's work, which involved predicting a high-speed solar wind, has been crucial for understanding the sun's atmosphere and the acceleration of solar particles. The Parker Solar Probe is set to get within 3.9 million miles of the sun's surface, a distance never before achieved by any spacecraft, to investigate the sun's corona and its mysterious heating. The mission aims to address long-standing questions about the acceleration of solar wind and the origin of the hot corona. The spacecraft's design includes a heat shield to protect its instruments from extreme temperatures and a thermal protection system to keep the panels at room temperature. The Parker Solar Probe is expected to provide valuable insights into the sun's behavior and help improve space weather forecasting, which can have significant impacts on Earth's power grids and satellite systems. The mission is scheduled to launch in 2018.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Passage 1 highlights a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, which found that rapid weight gain and loss, or \"yo-yo dieting,\" increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death by 78%, 117%, and 124% respectively. The study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, emphasizes the importance of maintaining weight stability for better health.\n\nPassage 2 explains that coronary artery disease, the primary cause of heart attacks, occurs when cholesterol deposits in arteries lead to narrowed blood flow. Yo-yo dieting, or weight cycling, is mentioned as a contributing factor, with repeated fluctuations in weight leading to increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. The article advises maintaining a healthy lifestyle as a preventive measure against coronary artery disease.\n\nPassage 3 presents a new research finding that yo-yo dieting has more severe consequences for individuals with coronary heart disease, with large weight fluctuations increasing the risk by 124% for heart attacks, strokes, and deaths. The study, conducted by Dr. Bangalore and his team at NYU Langone Medical Center, underscores the need to investigate the role of gut microbes in this phenomenon.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the negative health impacts of yo-yo dieting, particularly for individuals with pre-existing heart conditions. It suggests that maintaining a stable weight is crucial to reducing the risk of heart disease complications.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

These findings challenge the traditional belief that colorectal cancer is primarily a disease affecting older individuals. According to the University of Michigan's study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the US was younger than 50, with a higher likelihood of advanced-stage tumors and more aggressive treatment options for these younger patients.\n\nThe study by the University of Michigan's Samantha Hendren and her team found that younger patients with colorectal cancer were more likely to have tumors that have spread to the lymph nodes or other organs, leading to a higher chance of aggressive surgeries (72% for younger patients versus 63% for older ones). Despite the advanced stage at diagnosis, younger patients had slightly better survival rates, with a 5-year survival rate of 95% for localized tumors and 21% for distant disease.\n\nThe study also revealed that younger patients undergoing distant metastasis were more likely to receive radiation therapy, with 53% of patients under 50 receiving it compared to 48% for older patients. This younger population's increased risk and advanced disease at diagnosis highlights the need for improved risk assessment and screening guidelines.\n\nWhile some experts argue that screening guidelines might need to be reconsidered, others, like Harvard Medical School's Andrew Chan, caution against expanding screening to younger ages due to the low risk and potential costs. The study's findings emphasize the importance of recognizing the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients, such as changes in bowel habits or dark blood in stool, and the need for better risk evaluation and tailored screening strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients necessitates further research to determine if and how screening guidelines should be adjusted, considering the potential benefits and challenges of such a shift.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

{"pred": "The news articles discuss various aspects of advanced civilizations and their potential energy-harvesting strategies to expand and survive in the universe. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev introduced the concept of three levels of technological advancement, with Type III civilizations aiming to harness energy from all stars in their local galaxy. A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds a new perspective to this idea, suggesting that the expansion of the universe due to dark energy makes it imperative for civilizations to secure star energy before it becomes inaccessible. Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations would expand and capture stars, using structures like Dyson spheres or millions of satellites, to harvest their energy and prevent the stars from falling beyond the cosmic horizon.\n\nEnergy extraction from distant stars is not only a means to increase resource availability but also a necessity to avoid being left behind in the expanding universe. To locate such civilizations, astronomers are advised to look for unusual galaxy signatures, as they might exhibit altered light patterns due to the presence of Dyson spheres. The search for intelligent life beyond Earth could involve detecting the waste heat emitted by advanced civilizations, which would have a distinct infrared signature.\n\nIn literature, both Olaf Stapledon and Larry Niven have imagined alien civilizations using massive structures, like Dyson spheres or ring-shaped artificial constructs, to harness the energy of their stars. These structures would likely consist of millions of individual satellites, like solar collectors or statites, to maintain a stable energy supply.\n\nThe paper by Hooper highlights the importance of acting quickly to secure star energy before it becomes unavailable due to the expansion of the universe. This hunt for alien civilizations could potentially involve detecting unusual galaxy signatures or tracking the waste heat emitted by advanced structures. While Earth is still at a relatively low level on Kardashev's scale, the possibility of finding advanced civilizations millions of years older suggests that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be a race against time.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "The Daily Show, a popular late-night comedy show on Comedy Central, experienced significant changes and growth during its run. The show's format, initially modeled after a traditional newscast, evolved under the leadership of Jon Stewart, who took over in 1999. Stewart's vision was to have a more pointed, purposeful, and surgical approach to satire, focusing on issues beyond just making fun of local news and TV reporters.\n\nThe show's first host, Craig Kilborn, had a steady audience but struggled with the pressure of expectations. Jon Stewart's arrival brought a fresh perspective, as he sought to shake up the show's dynamic and challenge the writers to have their own opinions and not simply repeat the previous style. The show's correspondents, including Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, and others, were integral to the new direction, with Colbert joining as a result of his experience on The Daily Show during Kilborn's tenure.\n\nStewart's management style was characterized by empowering his writers, such as Ben Karlin, who became the head writer, and Steve Carell, who brought a new energy and authenticity to the show. The show's correspondents were encouraged to have their own unique voices and beliefs, which resonated with the audience.\n\nOne significant shift occurred when the show started to parody the media itself, with correspondents like Colbert using their roles to question and mock the self-seriousness of political anchors. This led to a change in the show's focus, moving beyond just lampooning eccentricities to addressing the underlying issues and power dynamics in politics.\n\nThe show's success was not just due to its humor but also the timing, as the rise of cable news networks like CNN and MSNBC challenged the dominance of traditional networks, providing a fertile ground for The Daily Show to comment on and subvert. The show's correspondents were encouraged to have their own unique personalities and beliefs, which contributed to the show's distinctive brand.\n\nIn summary, The Daily Show under Jon Stewart transformed from a comedy show with a focus on parody to a platform for political commentary, using humor to expose and critique the media and political landscape.

{"pred": "The news articles cover groundbreaking discoveries in the field of archaeology, revealing the advanced tool-making and behavioral changes among early humans in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin. The research suggests that climate-driven shifts in the region led to the development of specialized tools and the formation of trading networks, potentially involving Homo sapiens and their relatives.\n\nThe oldest Middle Stone Age tools, dated around 320,000 years ago, were smaller, more specialized, and often made from faraway locations, indicating the existence of long-distance communication and trading. These tools, along with pigment applications, suggest a shift from scavenging to hunting and the emergence of a more diverse set of stone tools, marking the beginning of the Middle Stone Age in Africa.\n\nThe shift from the earlier Acheulean culture to the Middle Stone Age was marked by the use of smaller, refined stone tools, made from obsidian sourced from distant locations. This indicates a greater reliance on trade and cooperation among human populations, as evidenced by the presence of pigment and the need for specialized tools like scrapers and spearheads.\n\nThe discovery of these tools and pigment suggests that the Olorgesailie humans were not only adapting to changing environments but also innovating and developing complex behaviors, similar to those seen in the Middle Stone Age in Europe, which was previously believed to be a \"human revolution\" that occurred around 40,000-50,000 years ago. However, the new evidence challenges the idea that modern behaviors emerged solely after the migration of Homo sapiens out of Africa.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that the Olorgesailie findings support the idea that complex behaviors and technological advancements were present in African populations before the emergence of Homo sapiens, and that these changes were likely driven by environmental pressures and the need for cooperation and resource management.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of the Olorgesailie tools and pigments reveals a more complex picture of human evolution and cultural development, challenging the traditional narrative of a sudden \"human revolution\" and highlighting the importance of long-term adaptation and social networks in shaping human behaviors. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between these behaviors and the broader species, particularly in the context of the African landscape during the Middle Stone Age.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The activists, led by Demeeko Williams, warn that if the shutoffs continue, more protests are expected. DWSD has been criticized for targeting residential accounts with young children and the disabled, while larger entities like golf courses and the state of Michigan, which owe significant amounts, remain untouched. The U.N. has even called the water shutoffs a violation of human rights, and a group from Windsor, Ontario, has shown support by delivering 1,000 liters of water.\n\nPassage 2 reports on two separate news items:一是a schoolgirl's return to school shopping ahead of the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, and二是a recipe for orange-zucchini pound cake, a light and easy treat for those dealing with the stress of the situation. The article also mentions a local author's gluten-free journey and a list of commercial accounts with delinquent balances, highlighting the disconnect between the department's efforts to collect unpaid bills and its inability to handle commercial properties.\n\nDWSD has intensified its efforts to collect delinquent commercial accounts, with shut-offs affecting about 12% of the 90,000 delinquent accounts. The department has faced criticism for targeting residential customers while ignoring some commercial entities, such as Vargo Golf, which has a significant delinquent balance. DWSD has announced a $1 million fund to assist low-income water customers, but the shutoffs continue, sparking protests and calls for intervention.\n\nIn the latest news, Detroit police arrested eight protesters, including religious leaders, for disrupting the water shutoffs. These actions have sparked a human rights debate, with some arguing that the treatment of delinquent customers is unequal and a violation of the human right to water. DWSD's response has been to provide $1 million in assistance and increase efforts to collect debts, but the issue remains contentious and has attracted international attention.", "answers": ["At least eight people were arrested yesterday in Detroit for protesting water shutoffs in a city where almost 40% of residents live below the poverty line.

Katriuk was accused of participating in a massacre in what is now known as Belarus in 1943. Despite numerous allegations and Canadian court decisions, Katriuk had maintained his Canadian citizenship until his death, which has sparked controversy as the Russian government had been seeking justice for these crimes. The Canadian government, however, had previously ruled that Katriuk had obtained his citizenship under false pretenses but found no evidence linking him to the atrocities.\n\nKatriuk's case had been a source of tension between Canada and Russia, with the Russian government calling on Ottawa to extradite him for war crimes. However, Katriuk's health had been a concern, as he had been suffering from a long illness before his death, which made it impossible for him to face trial in Moscow. This development comes amidst Russia's strained relations with Canada due to Ottawa's stance on Ukraine, with both countries engaging in diplomatic tensions.\n\nKatriuk's death has prompted the Canadian Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs to urge the government to consider holding Katriuk accountable for any war crimes, despite the lack of concrete evidence linking him to the alleged atrocities. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress, on the other hand, saw Katriuk's case as an attempt by the Russian government to divert attention from their actions in Ukraine.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the complex relationship between Katriuk's death, his past as a war criminal, and the political implications of his case in the context of Canada's tense ties with Russia. While the Canadian government had previously declined to extradite Katriuk, his passing raises questions about the fairness of the legal system and the role of war crimes in Canadian society.", "answers": ["There were two men at the top of this year's Simon Wiesenthal Center most-wanted Nazi war criminal list—and there is now no chance either one will face a court.

Despite losing the 1992 re-election to Bill Clinton due to a faltering economy and a conservative backlash, Bush's legacy has been reevaluated more favorably by historians. He was the last American president to serve in World War II and had a distinguished career in politics, including serving as vice president under Ronald Reagan and later as the 43rd President, succeeding his brother George W. Bush.\n\nDuring his presidency, Bush faced challenges such as the Gulf War, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the decision to raise taxes, which later became a controversial issue. He was praised for his leadership during the Gulf War and his ability to navigate complex international relations. After leaving office, Bush maintained a strong bond with former President Clinton and was known for his dedication to family and public service.\n\nBarbara Bush, his wife of 73 years, passed away earlier in the year, and their son, Jeb Bush, also pursued a political career. Bush's quotes and statements, such as his famous \"no new taxes\" promise, became defining moments in his tenure. In retirement, he remained active in diplomatic missions and even joked about his son's political campaigns.\n\nOverall, George H.W. Bush's life and presidency were marked by both triumphs and controversies, but his commitment to public service and his ability to adapt to changing times have left a lasting impact on American history.", "answers": ["With George HW Bush dead at 94, coverage of the life of the 41st president is plentiful.

Its story notes that while Bush served just one term as president, it was a consequential one. \"The Berlin Wall fell; the Soviet Union ceased to exist; the communist bloc in Eastern Europe broke up; the Cold War ended.\" And Bush's \"firm, restrained diplomatic sense helped assure the harmony and peace with which these world-shaking events played out, one after the other.\" Great detail: In its obituary, the Wall Street Journal notes that Bush flew 58 missions in the Pacific as a Navy pilot in WWII, all with the name of his girlfriend—Barbara—on the side of the plane. He once got shot down, with this video capturing the rescue. Bush is also the only American besides John Adams to be both president and the father of a president.

Simpson, who was convicted of armed robbery and faces a minimum sentence of nine to 33 years, has been in prison since 2008. Simpson's parole hearing is considered a formality, as the Nevada Parole Board has announced it will rule on the matter immediately after the hearing, skipping the usual waiting period. If parole is granted, Simpson could be released from Lovelock Correctional Center, where he is currently serving his time.\n\nSimpson's net worth, which was once $10.8 million, has significantly declined due to legal judgments and financial setbacks. He was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages to the families of the victims in a separate civil case, but only a small portion has been collected. His friend and former lawyer, Tom Scotto, suggests that Simpson should focus on disappearing from the spotlight rather than seeking to return to a life of public scrutiny.\n\nDuring his time in prison, Simpson has expressed regret for the 2007 robbery and has claimed to have been a model prisoner, stating that he has tried to be a positive influence. However, his parole hearing will also consider his behavior since his arrest, including any disciplinary issues.\n\nThe media attention surrounding Simpson's parole hearing is intense, with 30 media organizations and numerous outlets planning to stream the event. The decision to grant parole is based on a scoring system that evaluates an inmate's behavior and other factors.\n\nWhile Simpson's appeal for parole is seen as a possibility, his past criminal record and the public's strong opinions from the 1995 trial could play a role in the decision. If released, Simpson's NFL pension would be protected, but the families of the victims would not be able to collect the full judgment against him.\n\nIn the context of his potential parole, Simpson's friend and defense attorney, Yale Galanter, argues that Simpson deserves parole due to his good behavior in prison. However, the decision is not guaranteed, and opinions remain divided, with some believing that Simpson's actions contributed to the public's anger over the book he co-authored, \"If I Did It.\"\n\nOverall, Simpson's parole hearing is a highly anticipated event, with the possibility of a significant shift in his life after nearly a decade in prison.

It highlights the MCA of 2006, which effectively stripped habeas corpus rights from individuals labeled \"enemy combatants,\" including legal residents, at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. The MCA has led to the lack of due process for these individuals, as the US government has prevented them from challenging their detention through the legal system. The case of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay, represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights, is currently before the Supreme Court, with the possibility of the court recognizing habeas corpus for chimpanzees in a separate case.

The water was inferred from analyzing the deuterium content in the Martian atmosphere, which shows a high enrichment, indicating that the planet had a global equivalent water layer that was 137 meters deep, with some basins and high altitude regions having even higher enrichments.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, used powerful infrared telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere and discovered that water near the polar caps is enriched in deuterium, suggesting a global ocean that could have supported a significant amount of life. The researchers estimate that the original water volume was enough to create a global ocean if evenly distributed, but it likely pooled in the low-lying northern plains, forming a deeper ocean that covered a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nMars' water loss over time is evident, with normal hydrogen (ordinary hydrogen) escaping into space due to the planet's weaker gravitational pull. This has led to a higher proportion of deuterium, or heavy hydrogen, in the remaining water. The study's authors, led by Geronimo Villanueva, suggest that the original water layer could have been at least 137 meters deep, making Mars a potentially habitable environment for a brief period during its early history.\n\nThese findings challenge the previous understanding of Mars' water presence, which was previously believed to be sporadic and insufficient for supporting long-lasting liquid bodies. The discovery of a more extensive and potentially habitable Mars raises questions about the planet's past habitability and the possibility of past life on Mars. However, the exact amount of water and the likelihood of life remain subjects of ongoing research and debate.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaurs, particularly large-bodied dinosaurs, may have produced \"closed-mouth vocalizations\" similar to those of birds. These sounds, which are low-throated and produced through a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch, were absent in many small-bodied dinosaurs but evolved separately in different groups, including birds and crocodiles. The sounds were likely similar to the cooing of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich, not the high-pitched calls of open-mouthed birds.\n\nThe process of creating dinosaur sounds for movies like \"Jurassic Park\" involved using real animals and sound editing to create the distinctive noises. For instance, the raptors' hissing was based on a goose's angry squawks, and the T. rex's roar was a combination of baby elephant sounds slowed down. The study also highlights that not all dinosaurs had the ability to produce these closed-mouth sounds, suggesting that they may have been limited to specific vocalizations in mating displays.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations, which are characterized by low-frequency sounds, are not common in small-bodied birds, but they have evolved independently in large-bodied lineages, such as those in birds and crocodiles.

{"pred": "Statistical methods, particularly Bayesian inference, have been used to aid in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and other lost objects. Bayesian techniques help refine the probability of finding the plane or other items in specific locations based on available data, such as flight paths, ocean currents, and damage to communication devices. The search for the plane has faced challenges due to the uncertainty of the plane's location and the possibility of a deliberate diversion, which affects the focus of the search.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian statistics were used to locate the wreckage after a two-year search, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. The Bayesian method allows for the incorporation of new information and the adaptation of search strategies as new details emerge. However, the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 search presents additional complexities due to the higher likelihood of a deliberate act causing the disappearance, which complicates the probability calculations.\n\nStatistical software, like that used by the US Coast Guard, simulates the movement of objects in the ocean, but Bayesian methods in this context are particularly valuable because they can handle uncertainty and incorporate new evidence. Bayesian experts, like those from Metron, help refine search areas based on probabilities and adjust models as new information comes in, but the search for MH370 has not yet been successful, with some experts believing the plane may be at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe use of Bayesian methods in the search for missing objects is not limited to the aviation industry, as seen in the Air France case, but it requires careful application and a thorough understanding of the subjectivity involved. While Bayesian statistics can provide valuable guidance, it's important to recognize that the search for MH370 might not yield the plane's location, as the plane's debris might not be found due to the passage of time and the complexity of the ocean environment.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes.

This event hasn't occurred since 1866 and will be visible to a wide range of locations across the globe. The moon, at its closest to Earth during a full moon, will appear as a Supermoon, making it 14% larger and 30% brighter than a typical full moon. In addition, it will be a Super Blue Moon, a rare occurrence when two full moons in a month align, and a total lunar eclipse, where the moon turns reddish due to Earth's shadow casting a unique glow.\n\nThe Virtual Telescope Project, in collaboration with various astro-photographers, will host an online, free virtual event starting at 11:30 UT, allowing people to witness the eclipse from their computers or mobile devices. The eclipse will be visible in the Pacific Ocean, and later, the Supermoon will rise above Rome, creating a spectacular sight. The eclipse will be a total one, with the moon passing through the Earth's shadow, resulting in a \"blood moon\" appearance.\n\nThe eclipse will be visible in different parts of the world, with the moon's passage through the Earth's shadow observed at different times depending on the location. For example, the total phase will start at 4:51 a.m. PST for the Pacific Time Zone, while in the Eastern Time Zone, it will begin with the moon setting. The moon's passage through the eclipse will be particularly interesting, with the eclipse lasting for 77 minutes.\n\nAstrophotographers from various countries, including Australia, the United States, and Italy, will contribute to capturing stunning images of the event. The Virtual Telescope Project's partnership with \"Pearl,\" a telescope at Tenagra Observatories, adds to the experience.\n\nFor those unable to view the eclipse in person, the Virtual Telescope will also stream the Supermoon rising over Rome and the total lunar eclipse from Australia. The eclipse is not only a unique astronomical event but also an opportunity for space enthusiasts to observe and capture the moon's beauty through simple smartphone adjustments.\n\nNo special equipment is required to view the event, and they are safe to enjoy without any protective gear, unlike solar eclipses.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night.

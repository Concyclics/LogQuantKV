The first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that exposure to cigarette smoke enhances the virulence of MRSA by causing it to become more resistant to antibiotics. This occurs through the stress it puts on the bacteria, making them less susceptible to the immune system's defenses, particularly the reactive oxygen species that macrophages use to fight off infections.\n\nThe second study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, also showed that e-cigarette smoke has a similar effect, making MRSA more resistant and more adept at invading human cells. The bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke exhibited a 4-fold increase in resistance to macrophage killing and were more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are crucial for combating infections.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke acts as a \"warning signal\" to MRSA, enhancing its ability to survive and cause more severe infections. The increased resistance observed in the bacteria not only prolongs their survival but also makes them more likely to cause serious infections in smokers. The researchers caution that this could contribute to the higher susceptibility of smokers to MRSA infections.\n\nBoth studies highlight the need for further investigation into the role of environmental factors like smoking in the spread and evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

In that period, 50 cases were diagnosed in 24 states, compared to only 21 cases in 2015. The highest peak of cases occurred between August and December 2014, with 120 cases reported, mostly affecting children under the age of 21. The exact cause of AFM is unknown, but it has been linked to viruses like polio and enteroviruses, including enterovirus D68.\n\nAFM symptoms include sudden weakness in the limbs, facial drooping, difficulty breathing, and speech issues. There is currently no cure for AFM, but treatment involves physical therapy and in some cases, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has shown promise in improving outcomes. The disease is rare, but the recent increase in cases has raised concerns among health professionals, who are urging parents and individuals to practice good hygiene and report any suspected cases to healthcare providers.\n\nEnteroviruses, including enterovirus D68, have been linked to the rise in AFM cases, as the virus can sometimes affect the central nervous system. However, the CDC has not detected the virus in all cases, and the connection between AFM and the enterovirus is not yet fully established.\n\nParents of affected children, like Carter Roberts, have expressed frustration at the lack of information about the illness, while doctors like Dr. Kevin Messacar emphasize the importance of maintaining hygiene and being vigilant about potential symptoms.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have found inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns on the cloth, suggesting they could not have been produced by a person lying on the fabric as described in the traditional account of the crucifixion. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and synthetic blood to simulate the wounds and analyze the flow patterns.\n\nThe researchers tested the bloodstains on the left hand, forearm, and the \"lance wound\" on the torso, finding that the angles and patterns do not match those of a person being crucified, particularly in the back of the hand and the arm position.

This finding challenges the traditional understanding of the crucifixion and raises questions about the authenticity of the cloth.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The PCTA reports a 300% increase in inquiries and long-distance hiking permits since the publication of the book and the release of the film. This has led to concerns about overcrowding, with some hikers reporting that the 50-per-day permit quota is often reached during the peak hiking season. The PCTA implemented a permit system in 2015 to manage the growing number of hikers and protect the trail and its environment. The increase in hikers has led to discussions about Leave No Trace principles and the need for better management, as well as potential impacts on the trail's natural resources and local communities.\n\nWhile the PCTA's efforts to disperse hikers and reduce overcrowding seem to be working, the current system faces challenges. The desire to maintain a balance between allowing access and preserving the trail's essence is a concern. Some hikers, like Rusty, express a longing for the quieter days when the trail was less crowded. The PCTA, with the support of Cheryl Strayed, is promoting the #responsiblywild campaign to encourage hikers to practice responsible and sustainable hiking habits.\n\nIn the future, the PCTA is considering further adjustments to the permit system, possibly including a more structured approach to managing hiker numbers.

To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The species, found in northeastern China, has been named for its rainbow-colored feathers, which are believed to have been used for both sexual attraction and potentially as a display feature. The fossilized dinosaur, with its head and chest adorned with rainbow-like structures, suggests that it had a distinct feather pattern that is not seen in other dinosaurs.\n\nCaihong's feathers are characterized by microscopically structured melanosomes, similar to those found in hummingbirds, which create iridescent colors. These feathers are arranged in a way that creates vanes with symmetrical vanes on either side of the rachis, resembling those of Archaeopteryx, a key ancestor of birds. The dinosaur's small, bird-like body and long, slender forelimbs, along with its unique feathering, suggest it may have been capable of gliding or hovering, similar to modern birds.\n\nThe fossilized dinosaur is about 161 million years old and belongs to the Paraves group, which includes birds and dromaeosaurs. Its large, short, and broad ischium, a part of the pelvis, and the absence of a distinct quadratojugal, a feature commonly seen in other dinosaurs, indicate its unique evolutionary position.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of feather coloration in understanding dinosaur behavior and evolution. The presence of iridescent feathers in Caihong suggests that these features may have been present in other dinosaurs as well, and their function could have been for communication or sexual selection.\n\nResearchers are excited about the discovery, as it challenges the traditional view of dinosaur feather colors and provides insights into the diversity of feather patterns in early paravians.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University found that three of the top five states with regressive policies are in the West, highlighting a trend of nanny-state regulations. The tax has also led to a 34% decline in sales at Costco and a 27% decrease at Fairplay Foods, with some retailers like Starbucks not being affected due to the tax's exclusion of milk-based beverages. The tax's repeal in Cook County, Illinois, and the subsequent sales losses for retailers are clear examples of the tax's negative impact on the local economy. The tax's failure to achieve its health goals and the pushback from consumers and businesses have led to calls for a review or elimination of the tax in other cities, like Spokane, where a similar proposal is being considered.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Researchers from the University of California Los Angeles and the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics analyzed data from 64,000 children and their mothers in the Danish National Birth Cohort study, revealing that women who took acetaminophen regularly had a 29% higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD and a 37% higher risk of hyperkinetic syndrome. However, the researchers caution that the study does not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship and advise pregnant women to limit their use of acetaminophen until further research is conducted.\n\nDr. Beate Ritz, an epidemiologist, suggests that pregnant women should not avoid acetaminophen completely but should consider avoiding chronic or long-term use.

The House has passed a bill to fund the government until December 15 with conditions, including a one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and a rollback of the medical device tax. Senate Democrats, however, are refusing to accept changes to the ACA, and President Obama would likely veto any bill with these provisions. The Senate's options are limited, with a vote expected on Monday to avoid a shutdown, but the likelihood of passing a bill with the ACA changes is slim.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, driven by conservative pressure, is pushing for a full-year delay of the ACA, believing it will provide a political victory for his party. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, on the other hand, has a strong stance against compromising on the ACA and is expected to reject any attempts to attach the anti-ACA provisions to the funding bill. The Senate, with its limited schedule, could pass a short-term funding bill to avoid a shutdown, but the chances of a delay on the ACA and the medical device tax are uncertain.\n\nA shutdown could result in a government service interruption, affecting around 700,000 jobs in the Washington region, with an estimated daily loss of $200 million.

There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

These findings challenge the traditional belief that colorectal cancer is primarily a disease affecting older individuals, as one in every seven colorectal cancer patients in the United States was younger than 50 in a study by the University of Michigan. The study, published in Cancer, showed that younger patients are more likely to have advanced-stage tumors and require more aggressive treatments, with radiation therapy being used more frequently for younger rectal cancer patients.\n\nThe study, based on data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, revealed that younger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to have distant malignancies, which have poorer survival rates despite the fact that they are diagnosed at a later stage. However, younger patients without a family history of the disease are less likely to receive routine screening, and this could contribute to the increased incidence.\n\nResearchers recommend that the medical community consider the possibility of younger patients developing colorectal cancer and improve risk assessment and screening decisions. While some experts, like Harvard Medical School's Andrew Chan, argue that the evidence is not strong enough to support changing screening guidelines, others, like the University of Michigan's Hendren, acknowledge the need for long-term support for young survivors.\n\nThe study's findings prompt a discussion about the appropriateness of maintaining the current screening recommendation of age 50, with some suggesting that a review of the guidelines might be necessary to ensure that younger patients are not being overlooked. However, any changes in screening guidelines would need to be carefully evaluated for their impact on reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer, as the balance between prevention and treatment is crucial.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

A rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, discovered during a survey, has been dated to around 49,000 years, making it one of the oldest human settlements in the country. The site, known as Warratyi, contains evidence of human activity, including the use of fire, stone tools, and ochre, as well as the presence of bones from the extinct species Diprotodon optatum, suggesting coexistence and possibly interaction between humans and megafauna.\n\nLead archaeologist Giles Hamm, along with Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard, stumbled upon the site during a survey, with the discovery being a result of a chance encounter. The site's age and the presence of advanced tools, such as stone axes and ochre, challenge the commonly held belief that humans entered the arid interior of Australia later than previously thought. The presence of these tools and the interaction with megafauna indicate a more complex and dynamic relationship between humans and the environment.\n\nThe excavation process at Warratyi involved careful analysis of artifacts and sediments, with a focus on minimizing contamination and preserving the integrity of the site. The study also highlights the ingenuity of the ancient inhabitants, who developed and used key technologies like stone tools and ochre, even in a challenging arid environment.\n\nThe findings at Warratyi challenge the conventional timeline, pushing the arrival of humans in the arid interior back to around 50,000 years ago, instead of the commonly accepted 50,000 years. This discovery underscores the adaptability and local innovation of the Indigenous Australians, who were able to thrive in the region despite the harsh climate.\n\nThe study, led by La Trobe University's Giles Hamm, contributes to the ongoing debate about the timing and spread of human colonization in Australia, suggesting that people might have reached the southern interior earlier than previously thought. The presence of burnt eggshells and the earliest known use of ochre at Warratyi provide valuable insights into the cultural practices and technological advancements of the early Australians.\n\nThe findings at Warratyi also challenge the notion that the arid region was a barrier for humans, as the evidence of interaction with megafauna implies that people were able to navigate the landscape successfully.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

Type III civilizations, which harvest energy from all stars in their local galaxy, are particularly relevant to the topic. A recent paper by Dan Hooper suggests that harvesting distant stars' energy is necessary to avoid the expanding universe's effects and the eventual unobservability of those stars due to the acceleration of the universe by dark energy. Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations would expand their \"sphere of influence\" by capturing and harnessing stars before they become inaccessible.\n\nIn the context of advanced alien civilizations, Hooper's paper highlights the importance of detecting their energy signature through unusual galaxy formations and the search for \"Dyson spheres\" or similar structures. These structures, such as Dyson spheres or satellite-based energy collectors, are proposed as a means for civilizations to harness the energy of their stars and potentially communicate with Earth before it's too late.\n\nThe reference to Olaf Stapledon's novel \"Star Maker\" and Freeman Dyson's idea of a Dyson sphere further emphasize the concept of advanced civilizations using massive structures to collect and utilize energy from their stars.

Jon Stewart's vision for the show was to be more pointed, focused on issues, and have a distinct perspective. The transition from the Kilborn era to Stewart's was marked by tensions between the new host and the existing writers, who initially resisted his desire to change the tone.\n\nStewart's first correspondent, Stephen Colbert, joined the show after a brief stint at ABC's The Dana Carvey Show. His laid-back, seemingly straight-faced approach complemented Stewart's more intellectual and satirical approach. The show's success led to the hiring of writers like Ben Karlin, who brought a fresh perspective and a focus on using comedy to critique the media and politics.\n\nOne significant shift occurred when the show started featuring correspondents like Steve Carell, who played an influential role in the show's evolution. Carell's character often parodied the media, and his interactions with the field pieces, like the infamous \"Steve Carell as Hitler\" segment, were a mix of humor and social commentary.

{"pred": "The news articles cover groundbreaking discoveries in the field of archaeology, revealing the advanced tool-making and behavioral changes among early humans in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin. The research suggests that climate-driven shifts in the region led to the development of specialized tool-making, including the use of obsidian from distant locations, indicating the existence of trading networks among early Homo sapiens or their relatives.\n\nThe oldest Middle Stone Age tools, dated around 320,000 years ago, were smaller and more finely crafted, reflecting the need for greater mobility and resource acquisition in changing environments. These tools, along with pigment applications, suggest a shift from scavenging to hunting and the potential for more complex social interactions and the exchange of resources over long distances.\n\nThe discovery of obsidian from up to 50 kilometers away from the excavation sites challenges the assumption that such technological advancements occurred only after the emergence of Homo sapiens. The presence of Middle Stone Age tools and the use of obsidian implies the existence of a trading network among early humans, possibly involving both Homo sapiens and closely related species.\n\nThe shift from the Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age, marked by the introduction of specialized tools and the use of obsidian, indicates a period of increased creativity and adaptation to changing environments. This period, around 320,000 years ago, is seen as a crucial point in the evolution of Homo sapiens, as it coincides with the emergence of the species.\n\nThe new studies also uncover evidence of pigment extraction, supporting the idea of cultural practices and the use of symbols, possibly for communication and identity. This evidence contradicts the notion of a sudden \"human revolution\" occurring around 40,000-50,000 years ago, suggesting that modern behaviors and cultural traits were present in Africa much earlier than previously thought.\n\nThese findings challenge the traditional view that \"modernity\" emerged with the migration of Homo sapiens out of Africa, as the development of complex behaviors and technologies occurred earlier in the continent's history. The research underscores the importance of understanding the social and ecological factors that drove these changes and the role of networks and trade in shaping human behavior.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

A study published in the journal Science indicates that a massive ancient ocean, comparable to Earth's Atlantic in size, covered a fifth of the Martian surface, holding an impressive 20 million cubic kilometers of water. The water was inferred to be depleted in hydrogen, with a global equivalent water layer estimated to be up to 137 meters deep.\n\nNASA scientists, using powerful telescopes, have discovered a high concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere, indicating a significant loss of ordinary hydrogen over time. This enrichment suggests that the planet's water had a D/H ratio 8 times higher than Earth's oceans, with some basins and depressions showing even higher enrichments. The data implies that the water in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to a level of 8 times Earth's standard value, suggesting a global equivalent water layer that was once 137 meters deep.\n\nThese findings challenge the previous understanding of Mars' water presence, which was believed to be sporadic and insufficient for the formation of extensive oceans. The presence of a global ocean on Mars raises the possibility of habitability, with the potential for life to have existed in the planet's distant past. However, the exact amount of water and the likelihood of life are still subjects of ongoing research and debate.\n\nIn addition to the ancient ocean, Mars' current methane detection by the Curiosity rover has sparked speculation about the existence of life, but the evidence for such life is not yet conclusive. The search for life on Mars continues, with the European Space Agency's upcoming Exomars rover planned to further investigate the planet's habitability in 2018.\n\nOverall, these discoveries point to Mars' complex and dynamic water history, highlighting the importance of understanding the planet's past conditions for assessing the possibility of past or present life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, the court found that Nestlé had not proven the shape's distinctiveness across all EU member states.

The case, initially sparked by a legal battle between Nestlé and Mondelez, has been a subject of debate, with some Brexit supporters suggesting it could affect the availability of the KitKat in the UK.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs likely made different sounds than the ones commonly portrayed in movies, according to new research. The iconic \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" roar from \"Jurassic Park\" is actually a combination of animal sounds, not a fossilized dinosaur vocalization. The actual sounds dinosaurs might have produced were closer to those of birds, with cooing or even a pigeon-like coo, not the roar we're familiar with from the film. The study suggests that dinosaurs, particularly large-bodied dinosaurs, might have had closed-mouth vocalizations, similar to those of some birds, but not all. These closed-mouth sounds, called \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" are believed to have evolved separately in different bird lineages, and the capacity for this type of vocalization was present in some extinct dinosaurs. While there is no direct fossil evidence of dinosaur vocalizations, the study highlights the diversity of vocal behaviors among birds and the possibility that dinosaurs, especially in large-bodied species, might have had similar vocalizations during mating displays. The evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and dinosaurs is likely linked to body size, with large-bodied birds like doves and ostriches being more likely to exhibit this behavior. The study's authors hope understanding these sounds can help fill in the mystery of dinosaur vocalizations, which remain largely unknown due to the limited preservation of dinosaur vocal organs in fossils.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers matched specific brain patterns with visual elements in the videos, allowing them to generate a video from the subject's brain activity.\n\nThe study involved subjects lying motionless in an MRI machine, watching movie trailers, and their brain activity was recorded. The computer algorithm then correlated the brain patterns with the video content, resulting in a video that reflects the individual's visual experience, even though it's often blurry and abstract due to the continuous nature of the process.\n\nThis technology has the potential to delve into the realm of dreams and thoughts, as it could potentially reveal what's happening in the mind without visual stimulation.

The search for the plane has faced challenges due to the need to update probabilities as new evidence emerges, such as the increasing likelihood of a deliberate diversion from the original course.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian statistics were used to locate the wreckage after a two-year search, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. The Bayesian method allows for flexibility in adjusting to changing information, which is crucial in complex search situations like the Malaysia Airlines flight, where multiple factors, including the possibility of a deliberate act, complicate the calculations.\n\nHowever, not all experts agree that Bayesian statistics is the best fit for the Malaysia Airlines case, as it can be limited when the situation changes drastically. Statisticians like Colleen Keller emphasize the importance of considering uncertainty and adapting to new information, even if it means revising initial probabilities.\n\nThe use of Bayesian methods in the search for missing objects is not without its challenges, as it requires quantifying subjective judgments, which can be difficult.

Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later. The couple also sent out invitations last week to a dinner party at their winter home in Palm Beach."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2360}
{"pred": "In Egypt, the country is undergoing significant political and social changes following the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. Egyptians recently voted in the third phase of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to gain further ground. The trial of Mubarak, now in his 83rd year, has resumed, with prosecutor Moustafa Suleiman accusing him of tyranny and oppression, claiming he installed his son Gamal as a successor to maintain power. The trial has been marked by calls for accountability and justice, with Mubarak and his sons facing corruption charges.\n\nThe third phase of the parliamentary elections has been dominated by Islamists, with the Brotherhood's party leading the way. However, the nature of the new parliament's composition is predicted to be largely controlled by Islamists, with the possibility of a coalition government. Economic challenges, including slow growth and decreased foreign investment, persist, and the country faces political tensions between the military council, Islamists, and revolutionary forces.\n\nThe upcoming elections and Mubarak's trial are seen as a test for the transition from military rule to civilian governance. The military, however, has not committed to ceding power by the end of June, leaving the future of the elected assembly uncertain. The election results and the distribution of seats among political parties will shape the composition of the new government, with the Brotherhood potentially seeking a majority to exert more influence.\n\nThe Brotherhood's leader, El-Adli, has expressed doubts about the party's ability to secure a clear majority, while the ultra-conservative Islamists, known as Salafis, have emerged as a surprise in the voting, gaining support for their hard-line views. The trial of Mubarak, if convicted, could lead to a harsh punishment, potentially including the harshest penalty, as the prosecution continues to build its case against him.\n\nIn summary, Egypt's political landscape is transitioning from Mubarak's era, with Islamists consolidating their power and the country grappling with economic challenges and political tensions. The future of the new parliament and the role of the military in governance remain uncertain, with the anniversary of the revolution marking a crucial moment in the ongoing struggle for accountability and democratic reforms.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "On Wednesday evening, a car driven by Nabila Altahan, a passenger in the vehicle, experienced a near-catastrophic incident in Mendon, a location near Sugar & Spice Restaurant. The driver's quick reaction to a GPS unit's unexpected turn-around instruction led to the car being suspended from a telephone guy wire, as reported by State Police. The incident occurred when the car, while traveling on Route 4, followed the GPS incorrectly, causing it to leave the road and end up on the utility pole support.\n\nThankfully, neither Altahan nor her passenger were injured in the incident, as stated by the police. According to the police release, the GPS system had directed the driver to turn around due to the car having passed its intended destination, but the sudden change caused the accident. A witness, Ray Ault, who happened to be nearby, confirmed the occurrence and witnessed the driver跳出 the car as it was suspended.\n\nEmergency services, including the State Police and Rutland City Fire Department, promptly arrived at the scene to handle the situation. This unusual incident highlights the potential dangers of relying too heavily on GPS navigation without considering real-time traffic conditions or the vehicle's actual position.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP.

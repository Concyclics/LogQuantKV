{"pred": "Two recent studies, published by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, have revealed a surprising connection between cigarette smoke and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). These findings highlight the negative impact of smoking on the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in causing infections.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers discovered that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA by altering its cell walls. This change in cell structure allows MRSA to better resist the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species, which are typically used by immune cells to fight off infections. The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing and 10 times more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, both key components of the immune response.\n\nThe second study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, also found that e-cigarette vapor, although not as potent as cigarette smoke, still has a similar effect on MRSA's resistance. E-cigarette vapor also made the bacteria more resistant and less susceptible to being killed by human cells in lab experiments.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke acts as a warning signal to MRSA, making it more resilient and harder to eliminate. The persistence of the increased resistance even after 24 hours highlights the potential for the bacteria to pass on this resistance to subsequent generations. The consequences of this increased resistance are significant, as it not only hampers the effectiveness of antibiotics but also enhances the bacteria's ability to infect humans, particularly in individuals who smoke.\n\nThe researchers emphasize the importance of understanding this connection to develop strategies to combat antibiotic resistance, as well as to discourage smoking as a means to reduce the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies contribute to the growing body of evidence linking environmental factors like smoking to the rise of antibiotic-resistant infections, emphasizing the need for public health interventions to protect both smokers and the general population.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The highest peak of cases occurred between August and December 2014, with 120 cases reported, mostly affecting children under the age of 21. AFM symptoms include muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and in severe cases, paralysis that can require ventilator support. The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it has been linked to viruses like enteroviruses and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus.\n\nEnteroviruses, specifically Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), have been investigated in some cases, but the CDC has not detected the virus in all cases, including those in 2014. There is no specific cure for AFM, but treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) have been suggested to potentially help in some cases. Parents and healthcare providers are advised to wash hands, avoid sick individuals, and maintain hygiene to prevent the spread of the illness.\n\nIn 2014, a significant outbreak of AFM coincided with an outbreak of enterovirus D68, leading to concerns that the same strain might be responsible for the recent rise.

{"pred": "The Shroud of Turin, a revered artifact believed to have been the burial cloth of Jesus, has experienced a new round of scrutiny due to a recent forensic investigation that challenges its authenticity. The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggests that the blood patterns on the cloth are inconsistent with the crucifixion wounds described in religious tradition. Researchers, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used blood flow analysis to compare the patterns on the shroud to those of a living person in various positions.\n\nThe bloodstain analysis revealed that the patterns on the Shroud are not consistent with a person being crucified, with angles varying greatly from the ones that would be expected for a hanging or crucifixion. For instance, the rivulets on the hand and forearm do not match the 45-degree angle typically associated with a person's arm being held out at that position. The researchers found that the blood flow on the shroud is more consistent with a standing model, rather than a person hanging on a cross.\n\nThe investigation supports the idea that the shroud's image was created through a standing model, rather than the actual crucifixion, casting doubt on the authenticity of the bloodstains. The study, however, does not rule out the possibility of multiple episodes of bleeding or the use of a painted or dyed cloth, leaving the door open for alternative explanations.\n\nWhile the Vatican, which regards the Shroud as an icon, has not officially commented on the findings, the inconsistencies in the blood patterns raise questions about the shroud's authenticity. The researchers emphasize the need for further study, as the blood flow patterns on the cloth do not match what would be expected in a real crucifixion scenario.\n\nIn summary, the Shroud of Turin's blood patterns, long considered a crucial piece of evidence, now point towards a non-religious or even artistic representation, casting doubt on its status as the actual burial cloth of Jesus. The investigation calls for further examination and raises the possibility that the shroud may be a medieval forgery or an artistic representation.", "answers": ["The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion; bloodstains on the linen shroud, which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb, form the image of a crucified man.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The founder, Ashok Mulheir, shares a personal experience that initially led her to ignore a photograph of a child in a residential institution, realizing that such a common initial reaction is a reflection of a broader societal apathy. \n\nLumos's mission is to shed light on these situations and advocate for the rights of these children. The majority of children in institutions are not orphans but are placed due to inadequate family support or due to the belief that it's for their best interest. The harsh truth is that the majority of these children suffer from poor living conditions, lack of education, and increased risk of abuse or trafficking.\n\nThe organization's efforts have led to significant progress in some countries, with the number of children in institutions decreasing. For instance, in Moldova, there has been a 70% reduction in the number of children in institutions since Lumos's involvement, and in the Czech Republic, the number has dropped by 69%. These successes are attributed to investments in education, healthcare, and fostering alternatives.\n\nThe article also highlights the importance of international donors, as their funding choices and principles shape the support available for children and families. Lumos, with its goal to eradicate institutionalization globally by 2050, is a key player in this global effort.

The house, one of the best-preserved from the period in the UK, contained flint tools, pottery with traces of food, and evidence of gatherings with feasts. The site, part of the national festival of archaeology, will soon welcome visitors for an open day.\n\nIn addition to the house, the excavation has revealed a vast array of artifacts, including beautifully crafted flint arrowheads, pottery with residue of past meals, and a Roman brooch. The presence of pig bones and a fired clay pot suggests the site was used for temporary gatherings rather than a permanent residence. The Marden Henge, a massive structure dating back to 2,400 BC, is the largest prehistoric monument in the area and was likely used for status and to showcase wealth and power.\n\nA 4,000-year-old Bronze Age child's skeleton, found near Wilsford henge, has been described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by Reading University archaeologist Dr. Jim Leary. The analysis of the find will provide insights into the child's gender, diet, health, and the time of burial. This discovery, along with other findings from the ongoing three-year考古 project, contributes to a better understanding of the lives and activities in the region surrounding Stonehenge.\n\nThe Marden Henge, with its enormous ditch and bank enclosure, was likely a center for gatherings and possibly a hub of community activities, as evidenced by the well-preserved building and the presence of a Roman structure. The site's importance in the context of the local landscape and its connection to the River Avon, another significant archaeological site, is being explored by the partnership involving the University of Reading, Historic England, and the Arts and Humanities Research Council.\n\nOverall, these discoveries challenge the traditional perception of Stonehenge as the main focus, suggesting that Marden Henge might have been a crucial center for Neolithic activities and gatherings.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge.

{"pred": "Three separate news articles are combined here to provide a summary of the incident involving a woman who died while using a smartphone app to navigate a mountain route in Snowdonia, as well as the lessons learned from the incident.\n\nPassage 1 details the tragic accident: Jane Wilson, a 53-year-old mountain climber from Stockport, and her husband Gary used a smartphone app to find a route down from the peak of Tryfan, but she accidentally fell and died due to the lack of detailed information on the app and the challenging terrain. Despite being experienced climbers, they attempted to traverse the west face of the mountain, which is known for its steep inclines and loose rocks. Her husband, Gary, raised the alarm and was eventually rescued by the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team, but it was too late to save her life. The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death.\n\nPassage 2 highlights the cautionary tale provided by Chris Lloyd, a member of the rescue team, who described the route as \"not a straightforward path\" and mentioned the importance of using a map and compass in addition to mobile apps. He also noted that Tryfan is a common location for accidents, and recommended using established routes like the North Ridge for first-time climbers.\n\nPassage 3 recounts the incident and the coroner's findings, stating that the couple's decision to use the app led to the fatal fall. The coroner's conclusion was accidental death, and the investigation revealed that the light boots worn by Mrs. Wilson were not suitable for the rough terrain, contributing to her fall.\n\nIn summary, the incident highlights the risks associated with relying solely on smartphone apps for mountain navigation, especially in challenging conditions. It underscores the importance of using traditional methods like maps and compasses, as well as considering alternative routes when navigating unfamiliar terrain.

Opponents argue that the tax is regressive, hurting low-income families, and does not effectively target health concerns. The tax has also been met with protests and public dissatisfaction, with some retailers seeing a decrease in sales due to customer avoidance. A study from the George Mason University's Mercatus Center suggests that Seattle's tax is among the most regressive and has not achieved its intended goals.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The White House and Democratic leaders are united in their refusal to make concessions on the ACA, while the political landscape remains tense, with both parties blaming each other for the impending crisis. The shutdown, if it happens, would have far-reaching impacts on federal services, local economies, and the overall functioning of government.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks. But for the Washington area, this is a tsunami.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 3547}

The spacecraft, originally known as Solar Probe Plus, will now bear Parker's name, marking the first time a spacecraft has been named for a living scientist. Parker's work, which involved predicting a high-speed solar wind, has been crucial for understanding the sun's atmosphere and the acceleration of solar wind. The probe will attempt to get within 3.9 million miles of the sun's surface, the closest any spacecraft has ever been, to investigate the sun's corona, which is much hotter than the sun's surface. The mission aims to unravel the mysteries of the sun's heating, solar wind acceleration, and space weather effects. Named after Parker, the Parker Solar Probe is set to be a groundbreaking mission that could lead to significant advancements in our understanding of the sun and its impact on Earth's technological systems.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

Neiman Marcus did not disclose the attack until after inquiries from a journalist, drawing criticism for waiting until after the holiday season.\n\nTarget, on the other hand, suffered a larger data breach in which credit and debit card information, as well as personal data like Social Security numbers, were stolen from 40 million customers. The breach, believed to be connected to the same group behind the Neiman Marcus attack, was caused by malware that siphoned off credit card information during the checkout process. The iSight report, filed to the US Secret Service, highlights the sophistication of the operation, with the source code indicating regions with advanced software coding capabilities for such activities.\n\nBoth retailers, Target and Neiman Marcus, were targeted due to their use of point-of-sale (POS) systems, which are prime targets for cybercriminals. The report from the investigation into Target's breach revealed that the attack was innovative and covert, using techniques not seen before in the eCrime world. This suggests a coordinated, international effort, with the source of the attack not yet confirmed due to an ongoing US government investigation.\n\nThe breach at Target was particularly damaging, as it coincided with the holiday shopping season, leading to a significant loss for the company and prompting concerns about the security of other retailers.

Dr. Sripal Bangalore, a researcher from the NYU School of Medicine, emphasizes the importance of maintaining weight stability for better health.\n\nPassage 2 explains that coronary artery disease (CAD) occurs when cholesterol deposits in arteries lead to narrowed blood flow, causing symptoms like chest pain and potentially life-threatening blockages. It underscores the significance of a healthy lifestyle in preventing and managing CAD, emphasizing the need for prevention.\n\nPassage 3 presents a new study that reveals the detrimental consequences of yo-yo dieting for individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD).

This is particularly concerning because CHD is a leading cause of heart disease in the US, and individuals with the condition are already at higher risk.\n\nWhile the first passage suggests that weight stability is crucial, the second passage emphasizes the role of lifestyle in preventing CAD, and the third highlights the need to investigate the connection between yo-yo dieting and health risks, especially for those with pre-existing heart conditions.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

These findings challenge the traditional belief that colorectal cancer is primarily a disease affecting older individuals. According to the University of Michigan's study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the US was younger than 50, with a higher likelihood of advanced-stage tumors and more aggressive treatments for these patients.\n\nThe study by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute found that younger patients, especially those under 50, were more likely to have distant malignancies, which are more aggressive and have worse survival rates compared to older patients. However, younger patients without distant metastasis had slightly better five-year survival rates, indicating that aggressive treatment may contribute to their longer survival.\n\nDespite the advanced stage at diagnosis, younger patients with colorectal cancer are living longer without recurrence, suggesting that aggressive treatment strategies might be beneficial. However, the study's limitations, including a lack of data on family history and potential selection bias, need to be addressed.\n\nThe medical community is being urged to reevaluate the current screening guidelines, with some researchers suggesting that the age of 50 might not be the optimal starting point for routine screening in younger patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

{"pred": "The news articles discuss various aspects of advanced civilizations and their potential strategies for energy harvesting and expansion in the universe. The first passage introduces a model proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, known as the \"three types of technologically advanced civilizations,\" which involve harvesting energy from planets, stars, and eventually, entire galaxies. A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds a new perspective to this model, suggesting that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial to prevent the universe's expansion from isolating civilizations. Hooper argues that advanced civilizations would actively secure stars before they become inaccessible due to the expansion of the universe caused by dark energy.\n\nHooper's paper proposes that any advanced civilization would attempt to capture and harvest stars, using a concept called a Dyson sphere or a swarm of satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" to collect and beam the star's energy back to their home planet. These structures would be massive, consisting of millions of individual satellites, and could be used to harness the energy of a star for a Type III civilization on Kardashev's scale.\n\nThe search for advanced alien civilizations, particularly Type III, involves looking for unusual galaxy signatures and waste heat, which would be a characteristic of highly advanced energy usage. The energy signature of such civilizations would peak at longer wavelengths due to the large-scale harvesting of smaller stars.\n\nThe article also mentions the possibility of detecting these structures through the unique light signatures they would emit, as well as the use of satellite-based technologies like statites, which could potentially be used to recognize advanced alien civilizations.\n\nIn summary, the key points are:\n\n1. Kardashev's three-step model for galactic expansion, with civilizations harvesting energy from planets, stars, and eventually, entire galaxies.\n2. The importance of harvesting energy from distant stars to avoid being left behind in the expanding universe.\n3.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The research suggests that climate-driven shifts in the region led to the development of specialized tools and the formation of trading networks, potentially involving Homo sapiens and their relatives.\n\nThe oldest Middle Stone Age tools, dated around 320,000 years ago, were smaller, more refined, and made from distant sources of obsidian, indicating the existence of long-distance communication and cooperation. These tools, along with pigment applications, suggest a shift from scavenging to hunting and the emergence of specialized tasks, such as crafting spearheads and possibly even the use of symbolic pigments.\n\nThe shift from the earlier Acheulean culture to the Middle Stone Age was marked by a decrease in the size of tools and the introduction of more precise, specialized stone tools. This technological change, combined with the presence of red pigment and evidence of trading, indicates a more complex and interconnected society, with humans adapting to changing environments and forming social networks.\n\nThe findings challenge the traditional concept of a \"human revolution\" that was believed to occur around 40,000-50,000 years ago, suggesting that modern behaviors and innovations, such as symbolism and art, were present in the African Stone Age much earlier than previously thought. The study highlights the importance of long-distance trade and social interaction in the development of these behaviors, echoing the strategies employed by modern hunter-gatherer groups.\n\nIn summary, the research reveals a more nuanced picture of early human evolution, with advanced tool-making and cultural exchanges occurring much earlier than previously believed, hinting at the complex interplay between climate, environment, and the rise of human societies in Africa.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

In Detroit, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) is carrying out a plan to disconnect water to thousands of nonpaying customers, sparking protests and civil disobedience. About 50 activists, including nine who were arrested, demonstrated outside the offices of the company contracted for the shutoffs, demanding an end to the water cuts for families with poverty rates of 44%. The activists warn that if the shutoffs continue, more protests are expected.\n\n2. The U.N. experts have called the water shutoffs a violation of human rights, and the DWSD has been criticized for targeting both residential and commercial delinquents, with some large entities like golf courses and the state of Michigan also owed significant amounts. The department claims to have assistance programs in place, but critics argue that the high number of unpaid accounts, especially among low-income residents, necessitates the protests.\n\n3. The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department is intensifying its efforts to collect delinquent commercial accounts, targeting about 12% of 90,000 delinquent accounts. However, the department's contractor is not equipped to handle commercial shut-offs, leading to confusion and criticism. DWSD has announced a $1 million fund to help struggling customers, but this has not stopped the shutoffs, with the department expecting further protests.\n\n4. In response to the protests, DWSD has faced international attention, with the shutoffs being labeled a human rights issue. The city's water bills have increased, with an average of $75 per household, double the national average. DWSD's $18 billion debt is a major factor in the situation.\n\n5. Detroit resident Elena Herrada, a school board member, participated in the protests and was arrested along with other activists. DWSD has promised to reconnect those affected by the shutoffs, but the activists argue that the department's approach is unfair and that the issue goes beyond individual customers' ability to pay.\n\n6. Detroit City Councilor Georgea Kovanis and a group from Windsor, Ontario, have shown support for the affected residents by delivering 1,000 liters of water and demonstrating solidarity. The pressure from protests has led to the department announcing a $1 million fund to assist water customers.\n\nIn summary, the", "answers": ["At least eight people were arrested yesterday in Detroit for protesting water shutoffs in a city where almost 40% of residents live below the poverty line.

A World War II veteran, Bush had a distinguished career in politics, including serving as vice president under Ronald Reagan and later as the 43rd President, following Reagan's resignation due to the Iran-Contra scandal.\n\nAs a businessman, Bush started his career in oil and later became a prominent figure in the Republican Party, ultimately winning the presidency in 1988 after a campaign marked by a promise not to raise taxes (\"Read my lips, no new taxes\"). His presidency was marred by the economic challenges of the time, including a recession and a primary challenge from the conservative wing of the party.\n\nDuring his tenure, Bush oversaw the U.S. military intervention in Panama and the successful resolution of the Gulf War, earning him praise for his handling of crises.

Simpson, who was convicted of armed robbery and faces a minimum sentence of nine to 33 years, has been in prison since 2008. Simpson's parole hearing is considered a formality, as the Nevada Parole Board has announced it will rule on the matter immediately following the hearing, skipping the usual waiting period. If parole is approved, Simpson could be released on October 1, although the decision could be influenced by public opinion and the impact of his past criminal case.\n\nSimpson's net worth has significantly decreased since his days as a football star, with much of his fortune tied up in a divorce settlement and a civil judgment that he was ordered to pay $33.5 million to the families of the victims. His time in prison has been marked by his role in a 2007 robbery, which led to the charges he is currently facing.\n\nDuring the hearing, Simpson will likely argue that he has been a model prisoner, having apologized for the robbery and expressing a desire to reconnect with his family and contribute to society. However, his past, particularly the highly publicized murder trial of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and the book he co-authored, \"If I Did It,\" have fueled public interest and skepticism about his rehabilitation.\n\nHis friend and defense attorney Tom Scotto suggests that Simpson should focus on disappearing from the spotlight to avoid further scrutiny and potential negative reactions. If released, Simpson's NFL pension, protected by law, would provide a source of income, but the families of the victims are expected to continue pursuing the judgment against him.\n\nIn summary, O.J.

This move is aimed at reducing the island's reliance on illegal drug trafficking and addressing the historical issue of criminalizing Rastafarians for their religious use of ganja.\n\nThe legislation establishes a cannabis licensing authority to oversee the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. It also allows tourists with medical prescriptions to legally import small amounts of marijuana for personal use. However, the government emphasizes that it will not relax its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots.\n\nPeter Bunting, Jamaica's national security minister, clarifies that the law is not a relaxation of drug laws but rather a shift towards a more controlled and regulated environment. The US assistant secretary for counter-narcotics affairs, William Brownfield, acknowledges the law as Jamaica's own decision but cautions that marijuana trafficking remains illegal in the US.\n\nThe move to decriminalize marijuana is seen as an opportunity for Jamaica to capitalize on the growing global interest in medical marijuana, health tourism, and the development of cannabis-based products. The island hopes to become a player in the medical cannabis market and reduce the negative impact of drug convictions on its population.\n\nThe legislation also addresses the historical discrimination against Rastafarians, who can now legally use marijuana for religious purposes.

{"pred": "The latest discoveries in Mars exploration reveal a significant body of water that once covered a large portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, about 4.5 billion years ago. A massive ancient ocean, comparable to Earth's Atlantic in size, covered nearly half of Mars, with a volume of 20 million cubic kilometers, according to NASA scientists. The water was inferred from analyzing the deuterium content in the Martian atmosphere, which showed a high enrichment, indicating a global ocean that could reach depths of up to 137 meters, or about 450 feet.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, used advanced telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere and discovered that water near the polar caps is enriched in deuterium, suggesting a global water layer that was once 137 meters deep. This discovery challenges the previous belief that Mars had limited water and raises the possibility of a more habitable past, with conditions suitable for the existence of life.\n\nThe presence of a global ocean on Mars, as well as the planet's warm and wet environment during its youth, is seen as a major breakthrough in understanding the planet's history. However, the exact amount of water that was present and how it evaporated over time remains a topic of discussion among scientists. While the current water levels in the polar caps suggest a significant loss, the original ocean may have been much deeper and more extensive.\n\nNASA's Mars rover, Curiosity, has also contributed to the water findings, detecting standing water on the planet for 1.5 billion years, further supporting the idea that Mars could have been habitable for a longer period. The search for life on Mars is expected to intensify with the upcoming European Space Agency's Exomars rover in 2018, as these discoveries continue to reshape our understanding of Mars' potential habitability.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs likely made a variety of sounds, but their actual vocalizations were largely unknown due to the inaccessibility of their vocal organs, which are made of soft tissues that do not fossilize. The latest research suggests that dinosaurs, like some birds, may have employed closed-mouth vocalizations, which are produced by a throaty whooshing rather than high-pitched bird calls. These sounds were found to be more common in large-bodied birds, as they are facilitated by a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the Jurassic Park movie, used real animal sounds to create the dinosaur noises but also admitted to using his own friends' voices, like his dog's barking, to mimic the sounds of the T. rex. For instance, the raptor's hissing was based on a goose's angry squawks, and the brachiosaur's hooting-like sound came from a horse's mating call.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations, which involve air being pushed into the esophageal pouch, are not universal among birds. They are relatively rare in small-bodied passerines, like sparrows, but are more common in larger birds like doves and ostriches. The study by The University of Texas, Midwestern University, and others found that closed-mouth vocalizations have evolved independently in at least 16 lineages, indicating that they can occur in different species.\n\nWhile there is no direct fossil evidence of dinosaur vocalizations, the researchers believe that closed-mouth sounds could have been present in dinosaurs, particularly in large-bodied species, as it is a common trait in birds. The sounds produced by dinosaurs might have been similar to those of some birds, but without direct evidence, it remains speculative.\n\nIn conclusion, the study and the movie's sound design hint at a diverse range of vocalizations in dinosaurs, with some resembling the cooing of birds or the hissing of a raptor. The evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and dinosaurs indicates that they may have been a unique feature in sexually selected displays, and the discovery could shed light on the sounds of long-extinct species.

Stumpf said he was \"deeply sorry\" for what happened, New Republic reports. But—according to CNBC—he maintained it wasn't a \"scam\"—Warren's word—but a \"way of deepening relationships\" with customers. Warren accused Stumpf of \"gutless leadership\" for passing responsibility for what happened away from himself and other senior executives while blaming \"thousands of $12-an-hour employees who were just trying to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich.\" The employees' cross-selling scheme was at least partially responsible for Wells Fargo stock going up, making Stumpf's shares alone gain $200 million in value. While more than 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were fired, none of the senior executives are losing their jobs. Warren said the only way Wall Street will be reformed is if CEOs like Stumpf start seeing jail time.

{"pred": "Statistical methods, particularly Bayesian inference, have been used to aid in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and other lost objects. Bayesian techniques help refine the probability of finding the plane's location based on factors like flight path, ocean currents, and new information about the cause of the disappearance, which shifted the focus from an accident to a potential deliberate act. These methods were instrumental in the successful recovery of Air France Flight 447's wreckage in 2009, despite the challenge of unpredictable ocean currents.\n\nBayesian inference involves assessing probabilities for different scenarios and updating them as new evidence comes in. In the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Bayesian calculations are complicated by the need to account for the latest information, which suggests the plane may have been diverted, increasing the likelihood of finding it in specific areas. However, some experts argue that the complexity of the situation, combined with the limited number of similar失踪 cases in recent history, may make Bayesian methods less suitable for the current search.\n\nStatistical software, like that used by the US Coast Guard, can simulate the movement of debris, but the unpredictability of the equatorial region's currents made it difficult. Bayesian techniques, by considering multiple scenarios and adjusting probabilities, provide a flexible and adaptable approach to search operations. However, the effectiveness of Bayesian methods in the Malaysia Airlines case is debated, with some statisticians suggesting that quantifying probabilities can obscure the uncertainty in the situation.\n\nWhile Bayesian methods have been applied in the past, the lack of definitive evidence and the vastness of the search area make the current hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 challenging. The search for the plane's black box and the possibility of it being hidden or dispersed make the application of Bayesian statistics crucial but also raises questions about the likelihood of finding the complete aircraft. The search for the missing plane continues, with Bayesian techniques playing a role but also highlighting the importance of subjectivity and the need for careful interpretation of data.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

However, obesity is a growing problem worldwide, affecting both developed and developing countries, with some countries experiencing staggering rates.\n\nThe study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, reveals that obesity is rising in every region, with no country seeing a decline in the past three decades. This is a cause for concern, as obesity is a major risk factor for various health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. The rise in obesity is linked to factors such as increased availability of cheap, high-calorie foods, sedentary lifestyles, and changes in dietary habits.\n\nThe United States, despite having a high number of obese individuals, is not the only country with a weight problem. Obesity rates are particularly high in some Middle Eastern and Central American countries, as well as in Pacific and Caribbean islands.

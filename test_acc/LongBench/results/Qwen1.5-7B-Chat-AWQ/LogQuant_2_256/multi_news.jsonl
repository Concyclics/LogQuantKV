These findings highlight the negative impact of smoking on the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in causing infections.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers discovered that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA by altering its cell walls. This resistance is due to the bacteria's ability to resist toxic substances, such as reactive oxygen species, which are produced by immune cells to combat infections. The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing, and its resistance to antimicrobial peptides was also enhanced.\n\nThe second study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, found that e-cigarette vapor also has a similar effect, making MRSA more resistant and less susceptible to being killed by the body. Cigarette smoke, in particular, appears to function as a warning signal to MRSA, triggering it to adopt a more defensive stance. This increased resistance persisted for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that the bacteria's resistance could be inherited.\n\nThese findings have significant implications for public health, as they not only affect smokers but also contribute to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in healthcare settings and the community. The researchers emphasize the need for smokers to quit smoking to reduce the risk of not only respiratory issues but also the growth and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA.\n\nBoth studies emphasize the importance of understanding the role of environmental factors like cigarette smoke in shaping the behavior and resistance of bacteria, potentially leading to new strategies for treating and preventing infections.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract.

In that period, 50 cases were diagnosed in the US, compared to only 21 in 2015. The highest number of cases occurred in August-December 2014, with 120 cases reported, mostly affecting children under the age of 21. The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it has been linked to viruses like polio and enteroviruses, including enterovirus D68.\n\nThe symptoms of AFM include sudden weakness in the limbs, facial drooping, difficulty breathing, and speech problems. There is currently no cure, but treatments like physical therapy and in some cases, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) have been suggested to help with recovery. The disease is rare, but the recent increase in cases has raised concerns among health professionals, with some linking it to the same strain of enterovirus that caused the 2014 outbreak.\n\nParents and caregivers are advised to practice good hygiene, such as washing hands and avoiding contact with sick individuals, to prevent the spread of the illness. The CDC is urging healthcare providers to report any suspected cases of AFM to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn one case, a 3-year-old child named Carter Roberts, who developed AFM after a mild fever, lost control of his right arm and required hospitalization. His mother, Robin Roberts, expressed frustration about the lack of information about the condition. Similarly, a 4-year-old child, Laura Carson, was diagnosed with AFM after a respiratory infection, and her recovery involved months of rehabilitation and therapy.\n\nEnterovirus D68, though not directly linked to all AFM cases, has been detected in some patients, raising the possibility of a connection.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found them to be inconsistent with the supposed position of a person on the cross, as described in the New Testament. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and synthetic blood to simulate the wounds and tested various positions, revealing discrepancies in the blood flow patterns.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the bloodstains on the shroud, which depict a crucifixion, do not match the angles observed on the cloth, suggesting a standing model was used to create the patterns. The analysis, known as Bloodstain Pattern Analysis, showed that the rivulets on the hands and the flow on the back of the arm did not align with the supposed positions, casting doubt on the traditional depiction of the event.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin's age, determined through radiocarbon dating, places it between 1260 and 1390 CE, which is within the time frame of the Middle Ages. However, the lack of consistent blood patterns on the cloth raises questions about the method used to imprint the image, leading some to speculate that it may be a medieval representation or an artistic creation.\n\nWhile the Vatican has not officially weighed in on the authenticity of the shroud, the findings from this investigation have reignited interest in the shroud's true origins and the techniques used during the crucifixion, leaving the debate over its authenticity open.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The author, moved by a photograph of a child in a residential institution, became motivated to act and started writing letters, leading to the establishment of Lumos. The majority of children in institutions are not orphans but are separated due to poverty, discrimination, and lack of proper care. Shocking statistics reveal that 8 million children worldwide are institutionalized, with the majority having loving parents who can't provide for them. The harm caused by institutions includes physical and emotional trauma, low education, and increased dependency. Lumos aims to end this practice by investing in education, healthcare, and fostering alternatives. The organization has seen significant progress in countries like Moldova and the Czech Republic, with decreases in the number of children in institutions. The launch of the #Letstalklumos campaign on social media further raises awareness and encourages others to contribute to the cause.

The species, found in northeastern China, has been named for its rainbow-colored feathers, which are believed to have been used for both sexual attraction and potentially as a display feature. The fossilized dinosaur, with its head and chest adorned with rainbow-like structures, suggests the presence of microscopically structured melanosomes, similar to those found in hummingbirds, indicating the presence of iridescent pigmentation.\n\nCaihong juji is a small theropod dinosaur, with a bird-like body but a distinctively crested head, likely indicating a predator with a non-flying capability. Its feathers, which are well-preserved, are longer and more elaborate than those of other Tiaojishan theropods, and its unique feathering pattern on the tail suggests a specialized tail structure not seen in other dinosaurs.\n\nThe study's authors, including evolutionary biologist Chad Eliason and paleontologist Xing Xu, discuss the significance of the discovery, suggesting that Caihong's feathers could have played a role in communication or courtship. The dinosaur's fossilized feathers, along with its distinct head and tail features, provide insights into the evolution of feathers and their potential functions in dinosaurs.\n\nThe discovery challenges the traditional view of dinosaur feather colors, as Caihong's iridescent feathers are not found in all parts of the body, indicating that the coloration may have been more limited or specific to certain regions. The study also highlights the importance of advanced imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopes, to analyze the nanostructures in the fossilized feathers, revealing them to be similar to melanosomes in modern birds.\n\nIn summary, Caihong juji's discovery adds to our understanding of dinosaur feather diversity and the potential roles these feathers played in paravians, providing a more colorful and vibrant picture of the Jurassic period.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Former Mayor Ed Murray, who championed the tax, now admits it was a mistake, as the tax has been criticized for not affecting health, raising revenue, and disproportionately affecting low-income families. The tax has caused a price hike, with a $15.99 case of Gatorade increasing to $26.33, prompting retailers like Costco to direct customers to nearby locations to avoid the tax. The tax's failure to meet its goals and the negative impact on local businesses, including reduced sales and increased traffic to neighboring areas, have led to public protests and calls for the tax to be repealed. A similar tax in Philadelphia was also repealed after a similar public backlash. While some argue that the tax could have health benefits, the overall consensus is that it has been a poorly designed and unpopular policy.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

On Nov. 18, 2017, Rebekah Martinez was reported missing by her mother, who believed she had gone to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm. Her name was added to the California Department of Justice's missing persons list.\n\n2. The North Coast Journal, a local newspaper, featured Martinez in a story about the high number of missing persons in Humboldt County, leading to her identification by a viewer who recognized her from \"The Bachelor.\"\n\n3. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office confirmed contact with Martinez and removed her from the missing persons list after her mother contacted them.\n\n4. Despite being on \"The Bachelor,\" Martinez's disappearance was initially considered a missing persons case due to her age (22) and the lack of contact with her mother.\n\n5. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and the Humboldt County Department of Social Services worked diligently to locate Martinez, but her case remained on the missing persons list until she contacted her mother.\n\n6. The article highlights the broader issue of missing persons in Humboldt County, with a high number of cases on the California Attorney General's list, but not all are considered \"cold cases\" by the sheriff's office.\n\n7. The high number of missing persons in Humboldt County is partly due to the state's lenient reporting standards, with some cases being caused by runaway juveniles, cannabis industry workers, or those who intentionally disappear.\n\n8. The Eureka Police Department and the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office work closely with the National Missing and Exploited Children's database, but some cases remain unresolved due to limited information or cooperation.\n\n9. The article also mentions other individuals who were mistakenly listed as missing but were later found or had left the area, emphasizing the importance of accurate data management in the missing persons system.\n\nIn conclusion, the story of Rebekah Martinez's case highlights the complex nature of missing persons in Humboldt County, with a mix of real disappearances, intentional absences, and miscommunications.

The company offered free credit monitoring to affected customers and faced criticism for not informing them sooner.\n\nTarget, on the other hand, notified its customers about the data breach much faster, within a few days, after facing inquiries from the same journalist. Target's data breach was linked to a larger, international hacking campaign, with the malware used in the Target attack being new and covertly subverting network controls. The report prepared by federal and private investigators revealed that the attack was part of a broader, sophisticated operation targeting multiple retailers, suggesting a coordinated effort by a well-organized group.\n\nBoth Neiman Marcus and Target have been investigated by state attorneys general, including those from Connecticut, New York, and Illinois, as part of a joint inquiry into the possible connection between the two breaches. The report highlights the use of advanced software and regions with expertise in creating such malware, with Eastern Europe being a focal point for POS malware development.\n\nThe breach at Target, caused by malware that sucked up credit and debit card information without encryption, was unique in its execution and demonstrated the need for increased vigilance in the retail industry. The report warns that cardholders can expect more of these types of attacks due to the potential for high rewards and low risk associated with using POS hacking techniques.\n\nIn summary, the holiday data breaches at both Neiman Marcus and Target were part of a larger, international cybercrime operation, targeting multiple retailers.

The second lion, also a 13-year-old, was shot dead by rangers after it injured a motorcyclist, as it had become a threat to human safety. These incidents have sparked debates about the balance between protecting lions and ensuring human safety, with some questioning the use of lethal force in such situations.\n\nIn South Africa, a lion named Sylvester, which had escaped from a park, was also being considered for relocation or killing due to posing a potential threat to humans.

She claimed to be following a vegan diet and not want her child consuming any animal by-products, which led to the baby's condition being diagnosed as dehydration. The police received a tip about the situation and found the baby in need of immediate medical attention. After refusing to cooperate and not answering the door, the police were able to intervene and the baby was taken to the hospital. Markham is facing charges of child neglect and awaits a court hearing in August to determine her future. \n\nIn the second story, a similar situation occurred in Orlando, Florida, where a judge ruled in favor of a vegan mother, Sarah Markham (not the same as the previous case), who had her child, Caleb, taken away from her by the state when he was found to be losing weight and failing to thrive. The doctor recommended the child be hospitalized, but Markham preferred to use a soy-based formula. The court dismissed the child protective services' claim, and Markham was granted custody with the condition of providing a nutritionist's report. Her son, Caleb, is now back with her and has gained weight, and his grandfather expressed relief at the outcome.\n\nBoth cases illustrate the complexities of navigating medical advice and personal beliefs, particularly in the context of child welfare.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products.

These findings challenge the traditional belief that colorectal cancer is mainly a disease affecting older individuals. According to the University of Michigan's study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the US was younger than 50, with a higher likelihood of advanced tumors and aggressive treatments for these patients.\n\nThe study by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute found that younger patients, especially those under 50, were more likely to have regional or distant malignancies, which are more aggressive and have lower five-year survival rates compared to older patients. However, younger patients treated for distant metastases had slightly better outcomes, with a higher likelihood of surviving without recurrence.\n\nYounger patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer were more likely to receive aggressive treatments, with 72% receiving surgery compared to 63% for older patients. The study also revealed that younger patients with regional or distant disease had a five-year survival rate of 21.3% and 7%, respectively, compared to older patients.\n\nThese findings prompt discussions about the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults, but some experts, like those from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, argue that altering screening guidelines might not be straightforward due to the balance between preventing cancer and the potential risks of over-screening in young people.\n\nThe rise in colorectal cancer among younger patients is attributed to factors such as late symptom presentation, which could be due to a lack of awareness or misdiagnosis. Smoking, obesity, and poor diet are also mentioned as potential contributing factors. While some experts like Harvard Medical School's Andrew Chan acknowledge the need for further research, others, like the University of Michigan's Hendren, suggest that any changes in screening guidelines would require careful consideration due to the potential benefits and costs.\n\nIn summary, the growing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients necessitates a reevaluation of screening guidelines, but the optimal age to start screening remains a topic of debate, with the focus on balancing prevention and minimizing potential harm from unnecessary testing.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The site, located in the Flinders Ranges, was stumbled upon during a survey by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local elder Clifford Coulthard. The presence of blackened roofs and burning fires indicated human activity, with evidence of sophisticated tools and ochre use, suggesting technological advancements and interaction with the environment.\n\nThe site's age, around 49,000 years, pushes back the estimated date of human colonization in the arid interior of Australia by 5,000 years. The discovery challenges the commonly held belief that humans reached the region around 50,000 years ago.

The study also highlights the ingenuity of the ancient inhabitants, as they were able to establish settlements in the arid region despite the challenges posed by the harsh climate.\n\nThe findings challenge the traditional view that the arrival of humans in the arid interior was a gradual process, suggesting a more rapid expansion from coastal regions. The research underscores the adaptability and cultural sophistication of the Indigenous Australians, who were using advanced technologies and interacting with megafauna even before the current scientific consensus.\n\nThe study, led by La Trobe University's Giles Hamm, underscores the importance of considering local innovations and the need for careful dating methods in interpreting ancient human activities. It also raises questions about the interpretation of previous findings, as the age of the discovered axe fragment is still a subject of debate.\n\nOverall, these discoveries in the Flinders Ranges rock shelter provide a crucial insight into the early history of human settlement in Australia and challenge the conventional narrative of the continent's colonization.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

{"pred": "The news articles cover groundbreaking discoveries in the field of archaeology, revealing the advanced tool-making and behavioral changes among early humans in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin. The research suggests that climate-driven shifts in the region led to the development of specialized tool-making, including the use of obsidian from distant locations, indicating the existence of trading networks among early Homo sapiens or their relatives.\n\nThe oldest Middle Stone Age tools, dated around 320,000 years ago, were smaller and more finely crafted, reflecting the need for greater mobility and resource acquisition in changing environments. These tools, along with pigment applications, suggest a shift from scavenging to hunting and the potential for more complex social interactions and the exchange of resources over long distances.\n\nThe shift from the earlier Acheulean culture to the Middle Stone Age was marked by the introduction of specialized stone tools and the use of obsidian, which came from up to 50 km away. This indicates the development of social networks and trading among hominids, possibly hinting at the emergence of Homo sapiens or a closely related species.\n\nThe Olorgesailie findings challenge the traditional concept of a \"human revolution\" that was believed to occur around 40,000-50,000 years ago, as modern behaviors like symbolism, innovation, and art were present in the African Stone Age much earlier than previously thought. The new evidence supports the idea that complex behaviors and technological advancements emerged in response to environmental pressures and the need for cooperation among early humans.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that understanding the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age requires further investigation, as it involves multiple factors such as climate change, population dynamics, and the interplay between different hominin species. The discoveries also suggest that the roots of modern human behavior and migration may be more complex than previously imagined, with multiple groups adapting and exchanging ideas and resources in the region.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the importance of long-distance trade and cooperation in the development of early human societies, challenging the traditional narrative of a sudden \"human revolution\" and revealing a more gradual and interconnected evolution of behaviors and technologies in the African context.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

{"pred": "The news articles cover various aspects of the political landscape, including the reactions of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to the Oregon community college shooting, his stance on gun control, and his contact with the Russian government during the campaign.\n\nIn the first passage, Trump uses the shooting as an opportunity to defend Second Amendment rights, suggesting that armed individuals could have potentially prevented the tragedy. He claims to have a handgun carry permit in New York and compares himself to the fictional character Charles Bronson from the film \"Death Wish,\" suggesting he would use a gun in self-defense. He criticizes \"gun-free zones\" and argues that better mental health care could have helped curb the incident.\n\nPassage 2 focuses on Trump's comments about the Oregon shooting and his belief that the problem lies with mental illness rather than guns. He asserts that if teachers were armed, the situation might have been different. Trump's comments are seen as his most passionate on the topic since his campaign launch, and they have garnered a strong response from his Tennessee audience.\n\nPassage 3 delves into the question of Russian interference in the Trump campaign, but this part is not directly related to the other topics and seems to be a separate story.\n\nPassage 4 discusses Trump's response to the Oregon shooting, his emphasis on self-defense through personal gun ownership, and his criticism of strict gun control laws. He also defends his tax plan and brushes off suggestions that he would save money, emphasizing his own financial situation.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights Trump's use of the shooting to advocate for gun rights, his belief in the importance of mental health in preventing mass shootings, the possibility of Russian contacts with his campaign, and his economic arguments in favor of his tax plan.

The author compares this to previous changes like the elimination of the CD drive and the 30-pin connector, suggesting that the lack of a technical excuse for removing the headphone jack is particularly absurd. They argue that wired audio often sounds better than wireless alternatives, such as Apple's proprietary AirPods, and that the company's claim of \"space constraints\" for not keeping the headphone jack is illogical, as it affects not only headphones but also other devices that connect to the phone.\n\nUsers on social media, including the author, mock the idea of \"courage\" being cited by Apple's marketing chief, Phil Schiller, as the reason for the decision. They point out that the phrase \"courage\" is being used in a context that does not justify the loss of functionality for users. The author personally owns high-quality in-ear headphones that prove that wired audio can sound excellent, and they criticize the convenience and reliability of AirPods.\n\nThe article also highlights the irony of Apple's claim that \"it doesn't make sense to keep the jack\" when it introduces new features like stereo speakers and Taptic engines, which require the removal of the jack. The author suggests that the decision is a \"step backward\" and a \"walled garden\" that forces customers to choose between good sound and Apple's proprietary accessories.\n\nIn summary, the main point is that Apple's decision to eliminate the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 has been met with ridicule and criticism, with many arguing that it is a \"stupid\" and \"greedy\" move that sacrifices sound quality for proprietary convenience.

The MCA, enacted in 2006, effectively stripped habeas corpus rights from individuals labeled \"enemy combatants,\" including legal residents, at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. This move has been criticized for undermining the rule of law and allowing the executive branch to hold people without due process. The case of detainees at Guantanamo has faced legal challenges, with the Supreme Court set to hear their habeas corpus petitions. The MCA's impact extends beyond Guantanamo, as it grants the executive branch the power to label anyone as an \"unlawful enemy combatant\" without legal recourse.\n\nPassage 2 focuses on a recent court ruling in which a New York judge granted habeas corpus to two research chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, marking the first time an animal has been granted legal personhood rights in the United States. This decision, though, has sparked debate among legal experts. Some argue that it's a significant step forward, while others see it as a limited victory, as the court order has been amended to exclude the specific term \"habeas corpus.\" The case could influence future decisions on animal rights and sets a precedent for similar cases involving other research animals.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the erosion of habeas corpus rights in the wake of the MCA and the ongoing legal battle for the recognition of non-human animals as legal persons. The case involving the chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, though a victory for animal rights advocates, raises questions about the interpretation of habeas corpus and its potential implications for other animals and legal cases. Both topics serve as reminders of the importance of habeas corpus as a safeguard against unwarranted executive detention and the need to protect fundamental legal rights.", "answers": ["The writ of habeas corpus lets prisoners appear in court to make their captors justify why they're being held.

The U.S. Justice Department claims that the company was aware of the potential risks and still proceeded to purchase wood that may have been harvested illegally.

The Environmental Investigation Agency's director, Andrea Johnson, disputes the term \"verification\" used in the story, emphasizing that it does not require independent certification. The recent raids and the company's struggle to prove its compliance with the law have affected the guitar industry, with some manufacturers like Chris Martin supporting the Lacey Act but expressing concerns about its retroactive nature.\n\nGibson's previous seizure in 2009, also due to the Lacey Act, demonstrates the government's enforcement efforts. The law, which covers both new and vintage instruments, has caused uncertainty among guitar makers and collectors, with some fearing potential legal issues for their pre-1970 Brazilian rosewood guitars.

A study published in the journal Science indicates that a massive ancient ocean, comparable to Earth's Atlantic, covered a fifth of Mars' surface and contained 20 million cubic kilometers of water, with some basins showing even higher enrichments in deuterium, the heavy isotope of hydrogen. This water, which persisted for about 4.5 billion years ago, was up to 137 meters deep, suggesting a potentially habitable environment for life.\n\nNASA scientists discovered this ancient ocean after analyzing data from powerful infrared telescopes, which showed a high concentration of deuterium in the atmosphere, indicating a significant water loss over time. The concentration of deuterium is seven times higher on Mars than Earth's oceans, with some areas showing even higher enrichments. This water loss is believed to have led to the formation of a global ocean on Mars, but the actual depth was likely deeper in the low-lying northern plains.\n\nThe presence of a global ocean on Mars challenges the conventional understanding of the planet's water history, as it was previously thought that water on Mars was scarce and intermittent. The discovery of such a large body of water raises questions about the planet's potential habitability and the possibility of past life on Mars.\n\nIn addition to the ancient ocean, Mars is also being explored for signs of life, with the detection of methane by the Curiosity rover, although the source of this gas is not yet definitively linked to living organisms. The upcoming European Space Agency's Exomars rover mission in 2018 aims to further investigate the planet's habitability by searching for chemical signatures of life.\n\nOverall, these findings suggest a more complex and potentially habitable Martian history than previously thought, with the potential for a warmer and wetter environment in the planet's distant past.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, the court found that Nestlé had not proven the shape distinctive enough across all EU member states. This decision means the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must reconsider Nestlé's trademark application. The ruling has implications for other brands operating in the European Union, as it highlights the need for proof of distinctiveness in each country. While the KitKat brand name is not at issue, the case could still affect national trademarks, such as Cadbury's purple wrapper, which is currently being challenged in the UK.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long thought to roar with the ferocity of movie monsters, might have sounded more like birds, according to new research. The study published in the journal Evolution argues that the ancient reptiles, known as archosaurs, primarily used \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" which are low-throat sounds similar to those of modern birds. These sounds, unlike the high-pitched chirps of birds with open mouths, are produced by a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch. The researchers found that only large-bodied birds, like doves and ostriches, exhibited this type of vocalization, suggesting that it evolved separately in different groups of animals.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the iconic Jurassic Park, shared that the raptors' hissing was inspired by the sound of a goose, and the T. rex's roar was created by mixing baby elephant sounds. The study, however, reveals that the majority of dinosaurs, including the fearsome T. rex, likely had a different vocal approach, with the key element of the T. rex's roar coming from a horse, not an actual elephant.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations, which are rare in small-bodied birds, were found to be a unique feature in dinosaurs, as they evolved independently in large-bodied lineages. The researchers believe that the presence of this vocal behavior in dinosaurs, like in birds, could have been associated with sexual selection, as it occurred in multiple lineages.\n\nWhile no direct fossil evidence exists for dinosaur vocalizations, the study highlights the possibility that some dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies, might have had a bird-like vocal capacity, similar to the cooing of doves. This could have been a specialized vocal display, separate from the more common open-mouthed vocalizations.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery challenges the commonly imagined roar of dinosaurs and suggests that their vocalizations might have been more akin to the cooing of pigeons or the mumble of ostriches. The study underscores the mystery surrounding dinosaur sounds and the potential for a rich variety of vocalizations in these extinct creatures.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

This is the first time scientists have been able to decode dynamic visual experiences, a step towards \"Jedi mind reading\" or interpreting thoughts and dreams without visual stimulation.\n\nThe study involved subjects lying motionless in an MRI machine, with their brain activity recorded as they watched movie trailers. The researchers then used this data to create a computer algorithm that matched specific brain patterns to visual elements in the videos. When the subjects watched the same trailers again, the algorithm generated a reconstructed video based on the brain patterns, providing a continuous, albeit blurry, representation of their visual experiences.\n\nThis technology has the potential to delve into the realm of internal imagery, potentially revealing what's happening in a person's mind without their conscious input. The researchers suggest it could one day be used to understand dreams and thoughts, though they caution that the accuracy of such reconstructions would depend on the quality of the brain data and the nature of the memories.\n\nAdditionally, the team has found a way to reconstruct videos through others' eyes, using functional MRI to map brain activity and match it with YouTube content.

The search for the missing plane involves calculating probabilities for each point in the area, updating these probabilities based on new information, such as the possibility of a deliberate diversion increasing the likelihood of finding the plane in certain regions.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian statistics were used to analyze historical data and combine it with the uncertainty of the search, leading to a more precise search area. However, the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has added complexities due to the higher probability of a deliberate act causing the disappearance, which adjusts the search probabilities accordingly.\n\nDespite the challenges, Bayesian methods can provide valuable flexibility in adapting to changing information, as they allow experts to incorporate subjective judgments and update their models as new data becomes available. Not all airlines or governments use Bayesian techniques in their search operations, but when they do, they can significantly improve the chances of locating missing objects, as demonstrated in the Air France case.\n\nWhile the search for Flight 370 has yet to yield definitive results, Bayesian statisticians remain hopeful that the plane's location can be determined with greater accuracy, given the right data and analysis.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3608}

Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one. (Just to keep things in perspective, we'll point out that Look is the sort of magazine that also runs headlines like, \"Royal Bodyguard Warns: 'Kate Middleton's Baby Is In Danger!'\") In other news, Huffington Post notes that it's Cruise's 51st birthday."], "all_classes": null, "length": 790}
{"pred": "The news articles report the tragic and mysterious deaths of the pharmaceutical entrepreneurs Barry and Honey Sherman, founders of Apotex, a global pharmaceutical company. The couple, who were found hanging in their Toronto mansion, initially sparked speculation about a possible murder-suicide due to early reports suggesting the husband may have killed his wife before taking his own life. However, the couple's grown children denied these rumors, stating that their parents were known for their love and commitment to their family and community.\n\nThe police classified the deaths as \"suspicious\" but not a homicide, and the investigation is now in the hands of the homicide detectives.

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country is undergoing significant political and social changes following the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. Egyptians recently voted in the third phase of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its gains. The trial of Mubarak, now in his 83rd year, has begun, with prosecutor Moustafa Suleiman accusing him of tyranny and corruption. The new parliament's role in the transition is uncertain, as the military council has not specified the distribution of seats among political parties. The economy is struggling, with growth slowing and foreign currency reserves declining. The election results have shown a shift towards Islamists, while the Brotherhood's leader, Essam el-Erian, doubts the party will win a majority. The trial of Mubarak and his sons faces calls for justice, with the prosecution focusing on their alleged role in the violent suppression of protesters. The upcoming anniversary of the uprising is expected to further fuel protests demanding an end to military rule. The legal landscape is complex, with demands for accountability and the possibility of a majority in parliament that could challenge the military's authority.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

According to State Police, the car, a Toyota Corolla, had veered off the highway while following the GPS guidance, which led it to leave the lane on Route 4.\n\nThe GPS system, which was likely guiding Altahan back to her intended destination after passing it, caused the driver to make an immediate U-turn, resulting in the car being suspended from the telephone pole.

They used a method similar to Google's PageRank algorithm, which ranks pages based on the number of incoming and outgoing links, to identify the most important individuals. Surprisingly, Carl Linnaeus, a 18th-century Swedish biologist known for his classification system, emerged as the most influential thinker globally. Linneaus' extensive contributions to taxonomy, including naming numerous species, led to a vast interconnected network of Wikipedia pages, making him the undisputed leader in influence. However, the study also noted that Linnaeus' dominance might be attributed to the structure of Wikipedia itself, with many science-related pages linking back to him. The study's findings suggest that Linneaus' influence stems from the sheer volume of connections to scientific content, rather than any inherent influence in the broader societal context.", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person.

Adams, who was released after being arrested in connection to the IRA murder, denied any involvement and criticized the timing of his arrest during an election campaign. His arrest was made under terrorism laws, and he was questioned about his involvement in the murder, which occurred in 1972. Adams questioned the use of \"pernicious, coercive legislation\" to question him and alleged that the police could have used discretion instead.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

Over the course of two months, the detainees endured brutal torture, lack of food and sanitation, and the constant threat of execution. As rebels approached the capital city, Gaddafi's soldiers executed 150 detainees, including Salahuddin's brother. Salahuddin miraculously escaped and shared his horrific ordeal with his family, who greeted him warmly. However, the story unfolded differently for many others. In another part of Libya, 150 detainees were brutally murdered by Gaddafi's forces, according to witness reports. The victims were thrown into a warehouse filled with the stench of urine and feces, and the guards burned them alive.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

{"pred": "Colorectal cancer, often considered a disease primarily affecting older men, is increasingly being diagnosed in younger individuals, according to recent studies. A team led by Dr. Samantha Hendre analyzed colorectal cancer data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, finding that 15% of colorectal cancer patients were under 50 years old. These younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer upon diagnosis, but they also received more aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation, compared to older patients. Despite having more severe cancers, younger patients showed slightly better survival rates. The study authors suggest that the medical community should reassess the current screening guidelines, potentially lowering the recommended starting age for screening. However, the benefits of earlier screening are unclear, and further research is needed to determine if adjusting screening guidelines would improve outcomes. The rise in younger patients with colorectal cancer highlights the need for increased awareness and education about the symptoms, such as bleeding, changes in bowel movements, and blood in the stool, and the importance of early detection through screening, especially for those with a family history of colorectal cancer. The study also raises concerns about the long-term effects of treating younger patients with more aggressive therapies, and the need for long-term support for these survivors. The medical community must consider these findings to develop appropriate strategies for managing younger patients with colorectal cancer.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

{"pred": "In recent astronomical research, a new perspective on galactic expansion and the potential for galactic colonization has emerged. The idea, originally proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, categorizes civilizations into three levels based on their energy consumption: Type I, Type II, and Type III. Type I civilizations harness their planet's resources, Type II civilizations utilize their star's energy, and Type III civilizations harness the energy of entire galaxies. However, a recently proposed twist on this theory suggests that the expansion of the universe, driven by dark energy, could pose a threat to civilizations that are trying to advance to Type III status. The universe's expansion is causing the distance between our galaxy and other galaxies to increase, making it impossible for civilizations to reach and utilize the energy of distant stars. This realization has led to the suggestion that civilizations might attempt to capture energy from stars by creating Dyson spheres, or Dyson swarms, around them. These megastructures would enable civilizations to harness the energy of their star, potentially leading to the creation of Dyson spheres around the star. The energy from the star would be redirected towards the civilization's home planet, allowing them to continue to harness energy without the limitations of the expanding universe. This concept, however, is still speculative and has not been proven. The idea of Dyson spheres and megastructures in science fiction, such as the Dyson Spheres in \"Star Trek\" and the Dyson Shell in \"Star Wars\", has been popularized in recent years. The concept of Dyson megastructures, including Dyson Spheres, Dyson Sails, and Dyson Statites, has been a subject of interest in science fiction and theoretical physics. These megastructures, which could potentially harness the energy of a star, have been a staple in science fiction literature, such as in Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" and in \"Star Trek\" episodes. The idea of Dyson megastructures has been a subject of discussion among scientists, with Freeman Dyson's original proposal in 1960 and the recent suggestion by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermilab, that civilizations might use Dyson megastructures to capture the energy of stars to prevent them from being lost to the vastness of the universe.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was significantly influenced by environmental changes, particularly in Africa. Three new studies, published in the journal Science, indicate that the Middle Stone Age tools and trading networks emerged around 300,000 years ago, marking a significant advancement in human behavior and innovation. This finding contradicts previous assumptions that such tools appeared around 300,000 years ago, and suggests that these advancements occurred much earlier, possibly indicating the evolution of Homo sapiens. The researchers propose that the climate fluctuations and environmental challenges prompted the need for more sophisticated tools, trade networks, and innovation in information gathering and sharing. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools, including those made of exotic materials like obsidian, and the use of red pigment, suggests that these early humans engaged in trading and had a more complex social structure. This indicates that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was marked by a shift towards more advanced cognitive abilities, including the development of trading networks and the use of sophisticated tools, which are indicative of a more complex society. The researchers believe that these advancements were driven by the need to adapt to unpredictable food sources and harsh environmental conditions, leading to the development of trading networks and the exchange of goods, including raw materials, over long distances. This suggests that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was influenced by the environment, leading to the development of more sophisticated tools, trade networks, and innovative social structures.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it?

{"pred": "In a series of events that intertwine the worlds of music and environmental regulation, Gibson Guitar Corporation faced a significant legal challenge when federal marshals conducted raids on their facilities in Tennessee. These actions stemmed from Gibson's alleged involvement in trafficking illegally obtained wood, particularly focusing on the company's dealings with Madagascar's ebony. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) had previously expressed concerns regarding Gibson's role in potentially illegal operations within the country, leading to a raid in 2009. Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of clarity regarding the nature of the legal issues surrounding the company, stating that Gibson had suffered substantial losses without recourse to a court. The Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to include plants and animals, was cited by the U.S. Justice Department in a June filing as the basis for the ongoing investigation against Gibson. Andrea Johnson, Director of Forest Programs for the EIA, noted Gibson's attempts to source illegally from Madagascar, suggesting that the company knowingly engaged in activities that violated the law. Gibson denied these allegations, stating that the recently seized wood originated from India. The company's attorney claimed that Gibson had ceased sourcing from Madagascar in 2009. The Lacey Act, which prohibits the importation of illegally harvested wood, has been cited as a key factor in the company's challenges. The act has been described as retroactive, requiring companies to prove the legality of their wood sources. The EIA's Andrea Johnson acknowledged the challenges faced by Gibson, stating that the company had experienced difficulties in proving the legality of its wood sources. The EIA's stance on the matter has been supportive, advocating for the Lacey Act's enforcement and its role in reducing illegal logging. However, the company's attorney, Johnson, cautioned that Gibson had failed to provide evidence of its wood's origin, leading to confusion and potential legal repercussions. The EIA's stance remains firm, emphasizing the importance of the Lacey Act in protecting endangered species and promoting sustainable logging practices. The company's attorney, however, argued that Gibson had not been provided with sufficient information regarding the nature of the legal issues surrounding the company, leading to a sense of injustice and a lack of clarity regarding the company's rights and responsibilities under the law.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India.

{"pred": "In recent studies published by NASA, scientists have uncovered substantial evidence indicating that Mars was once home to a large, ancient ocean covering a significant portion of its surface. Using data collected from the planet's atmosphere, researchers discovered that Mars lost a considerable amount of water over time, leading to a higher proportion of deuterium (heavy hydrogen) in its remaining water compared to Earth's ocean water. This loss of water resulted in Mars having less ordinary hydrogen and more deuterium in its water molecules, providing insights into the planet's water loss history.\n\nScientists utilized advanced telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere and analyze the distribution of water vapor, focusing on the chemical composition of water molecules. They found that Mars had a global water content equivalent to a depth of approximately 137 meters, which would have created a global ocean covering roughly 40% of Mars' surface. This ocean persisted for millions of years, reaching depths exceeding 1 kilometer in certain areas, such as the northern plains.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient Martian ocean strengthens the possibility of Mars harboring conditions conducive to life in its distant past. However, the existence of life on Mars remains uncertain. The planet's current thin atmosphere and frozen polar ice caps suggest that any potential biological activity would have occurred under harsher environmental conditions compared to Earth.\n\nWhile the findings offer intriguing possibilities regarding Mars' past aquatic environments, they do not conclusively prove the existence of life on Mars. The search for extraterrestrial life continues, with missions like NASA's upcoming Exomars rover scheduled to launch in 2023 aiming to further explore the planet's geology and potential biosignatures.\n\nIn summary, the latest research indicates that Mars once possessed a large, warm, and potentially habitable ocean covering a significant portion of its surface, which could have supported conditions favorable for life.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Nestlé sought to trademark the distinctive four-fingered wafer shape of its KitKat bar in 2002, sparking a series of appeals and counter-appeals. The European Court of Justice recently ruled against Nestlé's trademark claim, stating that the company had failed to demonstrate that the distinctive shape of the KitKat bar was widely recognized across the entire European Union. However, the ruling did not dismiss Nestlé's appeal outright, leaving the door potentially open for the company to reapply for trademark registration based on new evidence showing wider recognition of the distinctive shape among EU consumers. The battle continues, with Nestlé asserting that the shape of its iconic snack is distinctive and widely recognized, while Mondelez argues that the shape is not sufficiently distinctive across the entire EU. The outcome hinges on whether Nestlé can provide sufficient evidence of widespread recognition of the distinctive shape of the KitKat bar across the EU. The case raises broader implications for trademark laws within the EU and the impact of multinational corporations on the global market.

{"pred": "In a study published in the journal Evolution, researchers have found that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to birds, but with a twist. The research suggests that some dinosaurs may have made \"closed-mouth vocalizations\" - sounds produced by pushing air into the neck muscles, rather than through the open beak. These sounds are often low-pitched and can be heard in birds such as pigeons, doves, and cassowaries. The study's lead author, Chad Eliason, believes that this behavior could have evolved in dinosaurs as a way to make mating displays more impressive. The research team used vocal data from a variety of birds and crocodiles to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and other reptiles. They found that the behavior evolved at least 16 times in different bird and reptile lineages, suggesting that it can emerge in various species. The researchers believe that dinosaurs, being part of the same lineage as living birds, may have made similar sounds, though the exact nature of these sounds remains unknown. The study's findings suggest that dinosaurs may have made sounds akin to birds' cooing, but with a closed beak, creating a unique, low-frequency vocalization. The research team's analysis of the distribution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and crocodiles suggests that dinosaurs might have made sounds similar to those of birds, but with a closed beak, potentially making them sound like \"some kind of a bird-like vocalization.\"\n\nThe study, led by the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Arizona, suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved multiple times in different bird and reptile lineages, including the 16 distinct groups that make up the bird and reptile families.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

In response, China imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of US goods. The US is now considering raising tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%.

By using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, they were able to reconstruct the visual experiences of subjects watching YouTube videos. This groundbreaking method involved analyzing the brain's response to colors, movements, and other visual elements, and then using this data to recreate the video content. The resulting videos, while blurry and abstract, provide a surreal representation of the subjects' mental projections. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of neuroscience, particularly in understanding the inner workings of the human mind. However, it also raises ethical concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of such technology. The researchers believe that this technology could potentially decode internal mental images, including dreams, thoughts, and even the content of the brain's interpretation of the world. They envision a future where this technology could be used to broadcast internal visual experiences, possibly even the contents of dreams and thoughts. The researchers are cautious about the potential applications of this technology, emphasizing the importance of understanding the brain's complex structure and the ethical implications of decoding internal visual experiences. They also acknowledge that the technology could be used to enhance the capabilities of individuals with disabilities, such as those with paralysis, by enabling them to control their environment through their imagination.

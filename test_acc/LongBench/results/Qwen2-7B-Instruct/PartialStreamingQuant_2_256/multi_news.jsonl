The show, which premiered on NBC, attracted around 4.9 million total viewers over the course of its two-hour premiere. This performance, however, fell short of expectations, as it was significantly lower than the ratings achieved by the previous season hosted by Donald Trump. The ratings for the premiere were notably weaker than the 2014-2015 season, which had an average of 7.6 million nightly viewers and a higher viewer engagement in the 18-49 age demographic. The network had anticipated a strong start for the show, considering the high-profile competition, including the premiere of \"The Bachelor\" and a college football game. Despite the initial ratings disappointment, NBC's \"The Wall\" managed to maintain a competitive edge in the 10 p.m. time slot, providing a solid lead-in for the show. NBC's Tom Bierbaum acknowledged the challenges faced by the show, attributing the lower-than-expected ratings to the tough competition and the lack of sports programming. However, the network was hopeful that the show would improve as the season progressed. It is worth noting that President-elect Donald Trump retains a financial stake in the show through his ownership of the production company that co-owns the rights to the franchise. The network had to navigate the complex issue of Trump's involvement in the show, which was managed by compensating him through the rights holder, MGM, rather than directly.

However, the tax has faced criticism and backlash. \n\nSeattle's soda tax has led to a significant increase in the price of sugary drinks. For example, a case of Gatorade that previously cost $15.99 now costs $26.32, including the tax. This has prompted businesses to post signs directing customers to stores outside the city where the tax is not applied. \n\nBusinesses like Costco have had to adjust their prices to reflect the tax, with signs indicating the new price and directing customers to stores outside the city. This has led to a decline in sales of sugary drinks in Seattle, with some shoppers opting to buy their drinks outside the city limits. \n\nThe tax has also faced legal challenges. The Illinois Retail Merchants Association and the American Heart Association have filed lawsuits against the tax, arguing that it disproportionately affects lower-income individuals and fails to address the health concerns it aims to tackle. \n\nThe repeal of the soda tax in Cook County, Illinois, serves as a cautionary tale. The tax was intended to reduce sugar consumption and raise funds for the city, but it led to a decline in sales and a shift in shopping patterns, with consumers opting to buy sugary drinks outside the city limits. This has resulted in a loss of revenue for the city and a potential loss of jobs in the retail sector. \n\nThe Seattle tax has also faced criticism for being counterproductive.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest.

Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

A study by Dr. Samantha Hendre and her team, analyzing data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, revealed that colorectal cancer cases in this age group have risen significantly, accounting for 15% of total cases. This finding contrasts with the traditional belief that colorectal cancer predominantly affects the elderly.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Cancer, indicates that younger patients are more likely to present with advanced-stage cancer, but they receive more aggressive treatments, including surgery and radiation, compared to older patients. Despite having more severe conditions, younger patients tend to have slightly better outcomes in terms of survival without a recurrence. For instance, the five-year survival rate for younger patients diagnosed with localized tumors is around 95%, compared to 91% for older patients. \n\nHowever, the study does not definitively answer whether screening guidelines should be adjusted to include younger age groups. While the increased prevalence of colorectal cancer in younger patients suggests a need for further investigation, the impact of such a change on overall survival rates and the potential benefits of early detection remain uncertain. The study highlights the importance of recognizing symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel habits, and blood in the stool, which can indicate the need for colon cancer screening. \n\nDr. Hendre emphasizes the need for further research to determine if adjusting screening guidelines would improve outcomes for younger patients. She also points out the potential need for long-term support for very young colorectal cancer survivors, considering the unique challenges they face in coping with the physical and psychological effects of their diagnosis and treatment. \n\nIn conclusion, the rise in colorectal cancer cases among younger individuals necessitates a reevaluation of screening practices and the need for more awareness and education regarding the early signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

Additionally, the researchers found evidence of early use of pigments and red ochre, indicating the potential for symbolic expression and abstract thinking, which could be indicative of more complex cognitive abilities. This finding pushes back the timeline for the emergence of advanced human behaviors significantly, challenging previous assumptions that these developments occurred after the emergence of Homo sapiens.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt.

The planet's early atmosphere was likely similar to Earth's, with a global ocean covering a significant area. However, the Martian atmosphere gradually lost its water content due to the planet's weaker gravitational pull causing water vapor to escape into space. This loss of water over time allowed for the development of a global ocean covering a substantial part of Mars' surface.\n\nScientists estimate that Mars had a global ocean covering 15% of its surface, which would have been at least 450 feet (137 meters) deep. This ocean persisted for a considerable length of time, providing ample opportunity for biological activity, according to planetary scientist Geronimo Villanueva. However, the existence of life on Mars remains uncertain, as the evidence suggests that the water was likely depleted by geological processes, leaving behind a smaller, less hospitable environment.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient Martian ocean strengthens the case for Mars being a potentially habitable planet in the distant past. The planet's water vapor composition indicates Mars had a more extensive and longer-lasting ocean than previously estimated, which could have provided a more conducive environment for life. The findings contribute to ongoing research into the possibility of extraterrestrial life on Mars, with the potential for future missions to uncover further evidence of past or present microbial life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Warren, known for her tough stance on Wall Street, demanded that Stumpf should relinqu his position and return any earnings made during the scam, and that the bank should be criminally investigated by the Department of Justice and the SEC. Warren's remarks came after Stumpf's admission that he had no direct role in the bank's actions, but rather, the employees were coerced into committing the act. Warren's statements were met with mixed reactions, including support from some quarters and criticism from others, including the Palestinian representative to the United Kingdom, who warned that the decision would harm the peace process.\n\nAdditionally, the summary mentions that Donald Trump, the US President, is expected to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, despite the fact that the US has traditionally supported the status quo in Jerusalem. The decision is expected to be announced on Wednesday, and it is likely to cause a significant international reaction, including protests and potential changes to the peace process. The decision comes after a shift in Middle Eastern politics, with Saudi Arabia reportedly offering a peace plan that would be more favorable to Israel than to the Palestinians. However, the plan's details have not been confirmed, and it remains unclear whether the US will continue to support the traditional peace process or adopt a more pro-Israel stance.", "answers": ["Sen. Elizabeth Warren went after Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf during a Senate hearing Tuesday with the kind of heat she usually reserves for Donald Trump tweetstorms. \"You should resign ... and you should be criminally investigated,\" NPR quotes Warren as saying.

Stumpf said he was \"deeply sorry\" for what happened, New Republic reports. But—according to CNBC—he maintained it wasn't a \"scam\"—Warren's word—but a \"way of deepening relationships\" with customers. Warren accused Stumpf of \"gutless leadership\" for passing responsibility for what happened away from himself and other senior executives while blaming \"thousands of $12-an-hour employees who were just trying to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich.\" The employees' cross-selling scheme was at least partially responsible for Wells Fargo stock going up, making Stumpf's shares alone gain $200 million in value. While more than 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were fired, none of the senior executives are losing their jobs.

Bayesian statistics, named after the 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, have been utilized to analyze data and provide probabilities for the plane's location. The method considers all available information, including the likelihood of various causes of the disappearance, the probability of finding the plane in specific areas, and the results of previous searches. \n\nIn the case of the 2009 Air France Flight 447, Metron Inc. used Bayesian methods to analyze historical data, crash theories, and search outcomes to pinpoint the plane's location. This approach allowed for the consideration of multiple theories simultaneously, adjusting probabilities based on new information, and updating the search area accordingly. The method proved successful in locating the plane, which was found in a search area that had not been previously considered.\n\nHowever, the search for Flight 370 remains challenging due to the lack of clear information about the cause of the disappearance. While the black box data suggested a deliberate action, the search area is vast, and the plane could have drifted significantly from its last known position. The use of Bayesian statistics in this case was limited by the assumption that the plane was more likely to be found in areas that had not been searched extensively. This approach, while providing a more focused search area, did not guarantee the discovery of the plane.\n\nThe search for Flight 370 continues, with experts using Bayesian methods to analyze data and update probabilities as new information emerges. However, the method's effectiveness is contingent upon the quality of the data and the assumptions made. The search for the missing aircraft remains uncertain, with the plane potentially located in a vast oceanic area, making recovery unlikely. Even if debris from the plane is found, it may not lead directly to the main wreckage, as the probability of finding the plane in areas that have already been searched is high, and the plane could have been in a less accessible location.

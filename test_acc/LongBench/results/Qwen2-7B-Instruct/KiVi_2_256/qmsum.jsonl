Additionally, the conversation delved into the issue of the initial null hypothesis regarding the number of states in the model, with a focus on the Italian dataset. It was noted that the initial model used 16 states, while the longest digit, \"six,\" required 18 states. The conversation also explored the impact of the initial and final null states in the model, considering their role in the overall system. Furthermore, the discussion included the use of a tool called the \"silence model\" for the Italian dataset, which was found to have a significantly lower number of states (nine) compared to the initial model. The conversation also touched on the possibility of reducing the complexity of the model to simplify the system, given that the current models might have more states than necessary. To address this, the team planned to examine the model parameters, including the number of states per state, and the number of states per state, to see if it could be reduced to a simpler form.

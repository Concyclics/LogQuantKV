They found inconsistencies in the blood flow patterns across the body, indicating that the bloodstains on the Shroud of Turin are inconsistent with each other, suggesting that the bloodstain patterns were likely created by a standing model, not a crucified individual. This contradicts the traditional belief that the Shroud is a genuine burial cloth from the 14th century.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

{"pred": "In the world of financial assistance, there's a growing demand for quick and easy money solutions, especially during emergencies. One such solution is the 1-hour, 2-hour, or even same-day cash help, which can be obtained through 1-hour, 2-hour, or same-day cash loans. These loans, however, come with a price - the interest rate, which can be substantial if the loan isn't paid off within the specified term. To avoid high interest rates, it's recommended to save for such expenses beforehand. However, for those who find themselves in an unexpected financial bind, there are options like emergency cash help, which can provide immediate relief. These loans often come with a price tag, as the interest accumulates over time, making it crucial to manage repayment effectively. The loans are usually short-term, with a maximum of 1-4 weeks, and are designed to cover urgent needs like medical bills, electricity bills, and other miscellaneous expenses. To ensure a smooth application process, it's essential to meet certain criteria, such as being a permanent resident in the UK, being at least 18 years old, having a stable income, and a bank account that's been open for at least 3 months. For those with less-than-perfect credit scores, there are online options like no credit check payday loans, which can be applied for directly through websites. These loans offer a budget-friendly solution for those who might not qualify for traditional loans. It's important to note that while these loans can be beneficial, they come with a price tag, specifically the interest rate, which can escalate if the loan isn't repaid promptly. To avoid falling into a debt trap, it's crucial to understand the terms and conditions before applying for such loans. Additionally, the news highlights the importance of planning ahead and saving for such emergencies, as the cost-effective alternative to these loans.

{"pred": "In 2018, Seattle introduced a 1.75 cents per ounce soda tax aimed at reducing sugar consumption, funding education programs, and subsidizing healthy food for low-income families. However, the tax has faced criticism for its unintended consequences. Seattle's tax has led to a significant price hike for popular beverages like Gatorade, which has increased by over 60%. This has prompted shoppers to seek alternatives outside the city, with some even crossing city lines to avoid the tax. The tax repeal in neighboring Illinois, where the tax had a similar impact, has shown that such policies can lead to a loss of revenue for the city and a decrease in sales of taxed beverages. The tax's health benefits are questionable, as it targets sugar-sweetened beverages without addressing the health concerns of those who rely on affordable, healthy alternatives. The tax's impact on local businesses, especially those outside the city limits, remains uncertain. The tax's health benefits are unclear, and its revenue-raising potential is questionable. Seattle's tax exemplifies the broader issue of regressive taxes that disproportionately affect lower-income individuals, as they are forced to spend more on basic necessities. The tax's impact on health, revenue, and local businesses is complex and multifaceted, with no clear consensus on whether it achieves its intended goals. The tax's implementation has sparked debate on its effectiveness and fairness, with some questioning its role in promoting health and others criticizing its regressive nature. The tax's future remains uncertain, with ongoing legal battles and a lack of clear evidence supporting its health benefits.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

The existence of this \"massive, icy planet\" was first proposed by Caltech researchers Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, who initially aimed to debunk the existence of a hypothetical \"Planet X\" that could explain the clustering of certain dwarf planets. However, their models suggested that a massive, distant planet was the cause of these anomalies. The researchers' latest work has provided strong evidence for the existence of Planet Nine, leading them to conclude that the planet is likely a massive, icy world with a mass comparable to or greater than Neptune.\n\nThe existence of Planet Nine has been confirmed by the gravitational effects it has on the orbits of smaller, icy objects in the outer solar system. This discovery challenges the current understanding of our solar system's architecture and could lead to a reevaluation of the existing planetary classification. While confirmation of Planet Nine's existence remains elusive, the evidence suggests that it could be a game-changer for our understanding of the solar system's structure and composition.\n\nThe existence of Planet Nine has sparked excitement among astronomers teams, who are now actively searching for the elusive planet. The search for Planet Nine is expected to provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system, potentially reshaping our understanding of the origins of the planets and the dynamics of the outer solar system.

The discovery of this hypothetical planet could redefine our understanding of the solar system and its constituent planets, potentially leading to a reclassification of the existing planetary hierarchy.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

The baby was reportedly diagnosed by a pediatrician as dehydrated and in need of medical intervention. Despite being informed of the necessity to follow medical orders, Markham took a stance opposing conventional medical advice, insisting on a vegan-based treatment plan. This led to her being arrested and charged with child neglect. However, in a turn of events, the baby's custody was restored to her, with conditions. The judge ruled that the mother could regain custody of the baby, contingent upon providing a nutritionist's report confirming the safety and suitability of the vegan-based treatment plan within ten days. The baby's health was deemed insufficiently cared for initially, leading to the removal of the child from the mother's custody. However, new evidence surfaced indicating that the mother sought alternative treatments based on nutritional advice from a \"natural\" or \"vegan\" doctor, which contradicted the medical consensus. The case was resolved in favor of the mother, acknowledging her right to pursue alternative medical opinions and treatments. The baby's health improved significantly under the care of relatives, and the mother regained custody of the child.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham.

{"pred": "Colorectal cancer, often considered a disease primarily affecting older men, is increasingly being diagnosed in younger individuals, according to recent studies. A team led by Dr. Samantha Hendre analyzed colorectal cancer data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, finding that 15% of colorectal cancer patients were under 50 years old. These younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, but they also had a higher likelihood of receiving more aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation. Despite having more severe conditions, younger patients showed slightly better survival rates compared to older patients. The study authors suggest that the medical community should reassess the current screening guidelines, potentially lowering the recommended starting age for screening. However, the ultimate impact of changing screening guidelines on improving survival rates and reducing mortality remains uncertain. The rise in colorectal cancer among younger patients highlights the need for increased awareness and earlier detection, particularly in those with a history of risk factors or symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel movements, or anemia. The study also emphasizes the importance of considering younger patients in screening recommendations, especially those with a family history of colorectal cancer. Further research is needed to determine if adjusting screening guidelines would improve outcomes and reduce mortality rates.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

Hooper's theory is based on the idea that the presence of dark energy is causing the expansion of the universe, which is pushing stars beyond the reach of any civilization. To prevent this, civilizations might create Dyson spheres, Dyson swarms, or Dyson shells around stars, effectively capturing their energy. This could lead to the creation of mega-structures that span entire galaxies, potentially leading to the development of Dyson megastructures that could be used to search for advanced alien civilizations.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was significantly influenced by environmental changes, particularly in Africa. Three new studies, published in the journal Science, indicate that the Middle Stone Age tools and trading networks emerged around 300,000 years ago, marking a significant advancement in human behavior and innovation. This discovery challenges the notion that modern behaviors and cognitive abilities arose solely with Homo sapiens, suggesting instead that the environment played a crucial role in shaping these developments. The researchers found that the use of exotic materials, like red ochre pigment, and the trade of raw materials, such as obsidian, indicates the emergence of social networks and trading practices among early humans. This finding implies that the development of complex social structures and information-sharing mechanisms occurred much earlier than previously thought, around the time when our own species, Homo sapiens, was evolving. The discovery of advanced tools and the use of red pigment suggests that early humans adapted to unpredictable food sources by foraging and innovating their tool-making techniques, indicating a shift towards a more sophisticated and interconnected society. This research underscores the importance of environmental pressures in driving the evolution of human behavior and innovation, challenging traditional views on the origins of modern human characteristics.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

{"pred": "In recent findings published by NASA, scientists discovered that Mars once had a large, ancient ocean covering a significant portion of its surface. This discovery was made possible by analyzing the chemical composition of water molecules in the Martian atmosphere, which showed that Mars lost a substantial amount of water over time due to the thin atmosphere and weaker gravitational pull compared to Earth. The planet's water vapor contained a higher proportion of deuterium, indicating that Mars had a global water volume equivalent to a depth of approximately 137 meters, equivalent to a global ocean covering roughly 15% of Mars' surface. This ocean persisted for millions of years, providing ample opportunity for the development of an environment conducive to life. However, the search for extraterrestrial life on Mars continues, with the possibility of life originating from a meteorite landing in the Martian ocean being explored. The discovery of a potential source of life on Mars would significantly enhance our understanding of the planet's past environmental conditions and the potential for microbial survival. The presence of liquid water on Mars in the distant past raises intriguing possibilities regarding the existence of ancient aquatic ecosystems and the potential for past biological activity. These findings contribute to ongoing efforts to unravel the mysteries surrounding Mars' habitability and the possibility of past life on the Red Planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

They argue that the trial should not have been held in Boston due to the intense media coverage and public sentiment surrounding the case. Additionally, they contend that the definition of \"crime of violence\" used in his conviction may have been too broad, potentially leading to the invalidation of his sentence. \n\nTsarniav's legal team also argues that the trial judge did not provide sufficient time for them to present a full case for mitigation, which could have influenced the jury's decision regarding his sentence. The defense has stated that they will challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty itself, citing concerns over the potential for bias in the jury selection process and the use of social media during the trial. \n\nThe legal proceedings for Tsarniav's case are expected to take at least a decade, considering the history of lengthy appeals for federal death row inmates.

In a groundbreaking study published in the journal Current Biology, the team used brain imaging data from subjects watching videos to develop a model that could uncover the subject's visual input. This model, when applied to the brain activity patterns, could reconstruct the video content, including colors, movements, and other visual elements. The researchers believe this technology could potentially be used to broadcast internal visual experiences, such as dreams, and could also be used to control the environment for individuals with disabilities. However, the researchers caution that the technology is still in its infancy and requires significant computational power to process the vast amounts of data involved. The researchers also acknowledge that the technology could be used for criminal investigations or court cases, but the ethical implications of such applications remain uncertain. The ultimate goal is to understand how the brain processes visual information and to decode the internal mental experiences, including dreams, thoughts, and other abstract visual experiences.

The sequester, which involves automatic spending cuts, is being used as a tool to scare citizens, but it doesn't seem to affect the politicians' actions. For instance, the House of Representatives has spent considerable time on non-critical matters, such as a roll call for the last day's proceedings, while ignoring pressing issues. In contrast, the sequester, which threatens to cut funding for various government programs, including defense, health, and education, does not impact the salaries of politicians.

The sequester, despite its potential to cause significant harm, does not seem to deter politicians from their usual inactivity, as evidenced by the House's minimal activity and the Senate's lack of action. The sequester, which includes cuts to essential services, is seen as less threatening than other potential fiscal crises, such as the 2013 government shutdown. The sequester's impact on the average citizen is less severe compared to the financial burden it places on the government's operational functions, such as the salaries of politicians, which remain untouched.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far.

The vehicle, instead of continuing straight, veered off the road and became suspended from a telephone wire, thanks to the quick action of the driver, no injuries were reported. The incident occurred around 8 pm, when the GPS directed the car to make an immediate turn, causing the driver to react swiftly and the car to end up dangling from the telephone pole. Nabila Altahan, the driver, managed to escape the situation safely. The State Police, along with the Rutland City Fire Department, were promptly alerted and arrived at the scene. The accident was witnessed by Ray Ault, who was nearby at a miniature golf course.

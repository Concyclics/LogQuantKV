Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged.

The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN.

The reliquary is one of only 4 holy relics containing ashes from the tomb of John the Apostle that have been found in the last 1500 years. The discovery of the reliquary is significant as it provides insight into the religious practices and beliefs of early Christians, who believed the site to be a holy place of healing and miracle-working. The find is also a testament to the importance of John the Apostle in the history of Christianity and the veneration of his relics. The discovery adds to the growing list of archaeological finds in the region, including a 10th-century Bulgarian royal seal and a reliquary containing the remains of St. John the Baptist. The find is considered one of the most significant in the history of the Burgas Museum, and the lead reliquary is described as a holy possession that held holy substances that were believed to have healing powers.

{"pred": "Colorectal cancer, often seen as a disease primarily affecting older men, is increasingly being diagnosed in younger individuals, particularly those under 50 years old. A study by Dr. Samantha Hendre and her team revealed that out of approximately 258,000 colorectal patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2011, around 15% were under 50 years old. These younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer upon diagnosis, with a higher likelihood of having localized or regional tumors spread. They were also more likely to receive aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation, compared to older patients. Despite this, younger patients showed slightly better outcomes in terms of survival rates, with a slight advantage in five-year survival rates for localized and regional disease. The study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendre, emphasized the importance of considering younger patients' unique characteristics and the need for further research to determine if screening guidelines should be adjusted to account for this growing population. The study also highlighted the significance of recognizing symptoms like bleeding, changes in bowel movements, and pain when diagnosing colorectal cancer in younger individuals. The findings suggest that younger patients might benefit from earlier screening and more aggressive treatment options, potentially leading to better outcomes. However, the exact reasons behind the increasing prevalence of colorectal cancer in younger individuals remain unclear, and more research is needed to understand the impact of lifestyle, environmental factors, and other potential causes.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

{"pred": "In recent astronomical research, a new perspective on galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to harness stellar energy has emerged. The paper, authored by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermilab, suggests that civilizations might be actively engaging in star-harvesting to secure energy resources and potentially prevent the encroaching effects of dark energy. Hooper's theory posits that advanced civilizations could be identified by their Dyson spheres, which are hypothetical megastructures that surround a star, capturing its energy. These Dyson spheres could be used to power a civilization's starship, allowing them to travel through the galaxy and beyond. Hooper's theory aligns with earlier work by Freeman Dyson, who proposed Dyson spheres in 1960. Hooper's paper has not been peer-reviewed, but it has sparked interest in the idea that civilizations could be using Dyson spheres to harness stellar energy. This concept has been explored in science fiction, such as in Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" and in \"Star Trek\" episodes. The idea of Dyson spheres and Dyson's original proposal have been revisited in the context of civilizations' potential to harness stellar energy for galactic expansion. The paper also suggests that civilizations might leave behind telltale signs in the light signature of their actions, which could be detected by astronomers. This could include the unusual brightness of a star, the presence of Dyson spheres, or the unusual composition of a galaxy's light, which could indicate the presence of Dyson spheres or Dyson's original Dyson spheres. The Dyson spheres could be Dyson's original Dyson spheres, or they could be Dyson's original Dyson spheres, which would be Dyson's original Dyson spheres.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed that the evolution of Homo sapiens and their ancestors was significantly influenced by environmental changes, particularly in Africa. Three new studies, published in the journal Science, indicate that the Middle Stone Age tools and trading networks emerged around 300,000 years ago, marking a significant advancement in human behavior and cognitive abilities. This discovery challenges the notion that modern human behaviors and innovations appeared abruptly 40,000-50,000 years ago, as previously believed. Instead, the research suggests that these advancements occurred much earlier, around 300,000 years ago, indicating that Homo sapiens and their ancestors adapted to the environment by expanding their social networks, trading resources, and innovating technologies. The study also indicates that the use of pigments and the extraction of exotic materials like obsidian for tools required extensive social interactions, suggesting that early humans engaged in trading networks and developed sophisticated tools and technologies earlier than previously thought. This finding contradicts the traditional belief that Homo sapiens evolved distinctively around 30,000 years ago. Instead, the research suggests that Homo sapiens and their ancestors responded to environmental changes by developing innovative technologies and trading networks, indicating that Homo sapiens and their ancestors had already developed sophisticated tools and engaged in trading networks by 300,000 years ago. This finding implies that Homo sapiens and their ancestors had already developed sophisticated cognitive abilities and social structures, challenging previous assumptions about the origins of human evolution.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

Israel responded to escalating missile attacks from Gaza by conducting a military campaign, targeting Hamas facilities and infrastructure. The conflict escalated when the Israeli Air Force struck Hamas's military headquarters and killed the group's commander, Ahmed Jabari, sparking a full-scale military operation known as Operation Pillar of Defense. Israel's offensive was aimed at stopping the barrage of rockets from Gaza, which had intensified in recent months. The conflict has led to the death of at least 19 Palestinians and three Israelis, with the situation escalating further when a Palestinian rocket narrowly missed Tel Aviv, causing alarm in the city for the first time since the 1991 Gulf War. Israel's allies, including Egypt, have condemned the rocket attacks and called for a ceasefire. Egypt's Prime Minister, Hesham Khaled, visited Gaza to assess the situation and offer support. The conflict has drawn international condemnation, with the United Nations expressing concern and the United States voicing support for Israel's right to defend itself. The conflict has also prompted the U.S. to ask friendly Arab countries to exert influence on Hamas. The conflict has raised questions about the future of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty and the potential for a ground operation in Gaza.

A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times. Israel has now hit 250 Gaza targets, while taking further steps toward a ground invasion, calling up 16,000 reservists, the Wall Street Journal reports. It's also steadily sending troops and armored vehicles to the border, notes CNN—between 1,500 and 2,000 are already there, one official said.

{"pred": "In recent findings published by NASA, scientists discovered that Mars once had a large, ancient ocean covering a significant portion of its surface. This discovery was made possible through the use of powerful telescopes and an analysis of the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere. The team led by Geronimo Villanoma, from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, found that Mars had a global ocean covering at least 13% of its surface area, which would have been approximately 1 mile (137 meters) deep. This ocean persisted for billions of years until the planet lost its water content due to the thin atmosphere and the loss of ordinary hydrogen to outer space. The research indicates that Mars had a global ocean covering a significant portion of its surface, which was enriched in heavy hydrogen compared to Earth's water. The team's findings are based on the chemical composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which suggests that Mars had a global ocean covering a substantial part of its surface. The research also indicates that Mars lost its water over time, leaving only a small fraction of the original water content remaining on the planet. The findings suggest that Mars was once a warmer and wetter planet, which could potentially provide conditions conducive to the emergence of life. However, the existence of life on Mars remains uncertain, and further exploration is needed to determine the possibility of extraterrestrial life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The ECJ overturned Nestlé's 2016 appeal against the European Union Intellectual Property Office's (EUIPO) rejection of Nestlé's trademark registration for the Kit Kat bar's shape. The ruling reinstates the EUIPO's original decision that Nestlé had failed to substantiate that the distinctive shape of the Kit Kat bar was widely recognized across the entire European Union. However, the battle isn't over yet. Nestlé claims that the shape of the Kit Kat bar is distinctive and recognizable in most EU countries, arguing that the EUIPO should reconsider its position. The ruling has sparked debate among trademark lawyers and observers, highlighting complexities in trademark enforcement across the diverse European market.

{"pred": "In a study published in the journal Evolution, researchers have found that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to birds' closed-mouth vocalizations, such as the cooing of a dove or the muffled sounds of an ostrich or an emu. The study, led by Chad Eliason and Tobias Riede, analyzed the vocalizations of 200 different bird species and concluded that dinosaurs may have made sounds akin to those of modern birds, but with a twist. The researchers believe that dinosaurs could have made \"closed-mouth\" vocalizations, which are low-frequency sounds produced by pushing air into the neck muscles, similar to the cooing of a dove or the grunting of an ostrich. The researchers suggest that dinosaurs may have made sounds that were either loud, like a raptor's hissing, or quiet, like a cooing dove. The research team analyzed the vocalizations of 200 different bird species and found that closed-mouth vocalizations are often associated with mating behaviors, such as the cooing of a dove or the grunting of an ostrich. The researchers suggest that dinosaurs, being part of the same family as modern birds, may have had the physical capability to make these types of vocalizations, though no fossil evidence of dinosaur vocalizations currently exists. The study's findings suggest that dinosaurs may have made sounds akin to the cooing of a dove or the grunting of an ostrich, but without the open beak that allows for the typical bird vocalization. The study's authors suggest that dinosaurs may have had the physical capability to make these types of sounds, which could provide insights into the vocalizations of their ancestors. The study's findings could help explain why dinosaurs may have had the ability to make sounds that are similar to those of modern birds, but with a twist - the sounds may have been produced with a closed beak, rather than an open beak as previously thought. The research team's findings suggest that dinosaurs may have had the ability to make sounds akin to those of birds, but with a twist, due to the presence of a closed mouth.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

But he also played Tommen's cousin, Martyn Lannister, in a few episodes of the show back in the third season, Mashable explains.

In a groundbreaking study published in the journal Current Biology, the team used brain imaging data from subjects watching videos to reconstruct the visual content of their minds. The researchers, led by Professor Jack Gallant, developed a computer model that could predict and recreate the video content based on the brain activity patterns detected during the viewing process. This technology could potentially decode internal mental processes, including dreams, thoughts, and even the content of the brain's interpretation of moving images. However, the researchers caution that the technology is still in its infancy and requires significant computational power to analyze the vast amounts of data involved. They also note that the technology could have implications for understanding and interpreting the brain's interpretation of visual content, such as distinguishing between objects and scenes. The researchers believe that the technology could also be used to broadcast internal visual experiences, such as dreams, and could one day be used to control the environment for individuals with disabilities.

The sequester, which involves automatic spending cuts, is being used by some politicians as a tool to scare the public, despite the fact that it doesn't impact congressional salaries. The sequester is seen as less threatening because it doesn't affect the funding for essential services like defense, security, and health, but it doesn't touch the salaries of politicians. In contrast, the sequester doesn't impact the salaries of politicians, including those in Congress, who continue to receive their full paychecks.

In the USA, obesity rates are particularly high among children, with 34% of boys and 38% of girls being overweight or obese. The rise in obesity is attributed to factors such as the availability of unhealthy food, sedentary lifestyles, and changes in the gut microbiome. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that obesity is a health issue across all income levels, with the rise in obesity coinciding with the rise in population and income. The World Health Organization estimates that obesity-related diseases claim 3.4 million lives annually. The issue is so widespread that it has been termed a 'global health crisis.' The problem is not limited to any particular region, with the USA having the highest number of obese individuals, followed closely by China, Russia, and India.

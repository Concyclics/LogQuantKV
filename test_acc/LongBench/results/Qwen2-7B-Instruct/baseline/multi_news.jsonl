The policy states that Samsung will not collect spoken words, but it will still gather associated text and usage data to evaluate and improve the voice recognition feature.

Voice recognition allows users to control the SmartTV with voice commands, but some interactive commands are transmitted to a third-party service provider for processing. Users can disable voice recognition data collection, but this may prevent them from using some of the voice recognition features.\n\nThe SmartTV is equipped with a camera that enables advanced features such as gesture controls and facial recognition for authentication.

The team employed Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) to examine inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns on the shroud, which they argue cannot be explained by a crucified or facedown corpse.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, involved using both real and synthetic blood samples to recreate the blood flow patterns on various body parts depicted on the shroud. The researchers found that the bloodstains on the left side of the cloth, which is more clearly defined, were inconsistent with each other and with the expected positions of a crucified individual. Specifically, the trickles on the back of the hand and the flow along the arm occurred at two different angles, which contradicts the supposed position of the body on the shroud. Additionally, the spear wound bled in a direction consistent with the shroud image when the test subject was upright, but the flow pattern did not match the one observed on the shroud.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the bloodstains on the shroud are inconsistent with each other and with the expected patterns for a crucified or facedown corpse, suggesting that the shroud may have been created using a standing model. This finding adds to the growing body of evidence questioning the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, which has been a subject of debate and scrutiny for centuries.

The excavation, part of the national festival of archaeology, has revealed a rectangular building, one of the best-preserved Neolithic houses in the UK, which was likely used for gatherings and feasts rather than as a permanent residence. The house, made with chalk and featuring decorations like pottery and jewelry, provides insights into the lifestyle and practices of the Neolithic people. The site also includes evidence of farming activities, such as seeds and charred grains, suggesting a diverse diet. The discovery of pig bones indicates the scale of communal events held at the location. \n\nAdditionally, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to belong to a child, was found at Wilsford henge, further enriching the understanding of the region's history. This find, complete with an amber necklace, offers opportunities for scientific analysis to uncover details about the child's life, including gender, diet, health, and the time of burial.

The passage advocates for planning ahead and saving for such situations, rather than resorting to high-interest loans. It also highlights the benefits of paperless payday loans with no credit check, which can be utilized for various urgent expenses like electricity bills, home renovations, credit card dues, weddings, telephone bills, and other miscellaneous expenses. The text encourages immediate application for these loans, assuring readers of a good deal regardless of their past credit history. It further explains that installment payday loans offer longer repayment periods, allowing borrowers to manage their finances through comfortable monthly installments. The loans are capped within a budgetary range of £80 to £1,500, making them suitable for smaller financial needs. To qualify for these loans, applicants must be permanent UK residents aged 18 or older, employed, earning at least £1,000 per month, and possess a bank account for at least three months.

They navigated the mountain's west face, known for its loose rocks and steep inclines, solely relying on Gary's phone for guidance. Jane ventured ahead to scout a route, asking Gary if it was safe before proceeding. Upon her return, Gary heard an exclamation, followed by a rock fall, indicating Jane's fatal fall. Realizing the severity of the situation, Gary climbed to a safer location and called for help. Members of the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team reached Gary and found Jane's body over 150 meters below, with injuries including a fractured skull and multiple severe traumas. The coroner concluded the death as accidental. The incident highlights the importance of traditional navigation tools like maps and compasses alongside electronic aids, as the smartphone app's limitations in providing detailed information contributed to the couple's navigational challenges.

Former Mayor Ed Murray, who resigned amidst allegations of personal misconduct, considered the soda tax one of his major achievements, aiming to reduce sugar consumption, raise funds for community college, and subsidize healthy food purchases for low-income families. However, critics argue that soda taxes do not promote health, drive revenue outside city limits, exacerbate income inequality, and unite diverse groups against them. \n\nBusinesses, especially Costco, have noticed significant price increases, with a case of Gatorade now costing 64% more than before the tax. Signs at Costco direct customers to nearby stores outside the city where the tax does not apply. Seattle's soda tax does not apply to beverages containing milk, such as flavored coffee drinks, which Starbucks has chosen not to tax. \n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar soda tax was repealed within two months due to widespread public opposition. The tax led to a 34% decline in sales at Costco's nine Cook County locations and a 38% increase in sales at stores outside the county. Independent retailers and restaurants also reported significant drops in sales and customer traffic. \n\nA bill reintroduced in the Washington State legislature aims to implement a statewide soda tax, following Seattle's example. Local representatives acknowledge the bill's limited chances of success this year. However, concerns are raised about the potential impact on businesses and consumer behavior if the tax were to be enacted statewide. \n\nCritics argue that the tax disproportionately affects low-income families and does not effectively promote health improvements. Instead, it leads to a shift in consumer spending patterns, with people choosing to shop outside the city to avoid the tax. The tax's intended goal of reducing sugar consumption and improving public health remains unverified, as it does not address the broader issue of diet and lifestyle choices. \n\nOverall, the implementation of soda taxes in Seattle and Cook County highlights the complexities and unintended consequences of such policies, including economic impacts on businesses and consumers, as well as challenges in achieving the intended health outcomes.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

{"pred": "The US government is facing a potential shutdown due to a standoff between Congress and the White House over funding for federal agencies. The House of Representatives has approved a plan to fund agencies through December 15, including conditions related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). These conditions include delaying the implementation of the ACA for one year and repealing the law's tax on medical devices. Senate Democrats have stated they will reject any changes to the ACA, and President Barack Obama has indicated he would veto such a bill. House Speaker John Boehner has faced pressure from conservative Republicans to continue fighting against the ACA, and there is a possibility of a short government shutdown if the Senate does not accept the House's proposal. The Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon, and Democrats could table the amendments to delay the ACA and repeal the medical device tax. The window for avoiding a shutdown is closing, and the House and Senate could agree on a compromise, but it is unclear how that would materialize. A shutdown appears likely, with the first one in 17 years expected to occur on Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken the lead role in pushing a hardball Democratic legislative strategy, refusing to negotiate on a short-term funding bill and instead aiming to force Republicans to cave on the ACA. Reid believes that the political backlash from a shutdown would be devastating to the Republican Party, potentially costing them their majority in the House. The economic impact of a shutdown is significant, with the Washington region, home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, expecting to lose an estimated $200 million per day and see more than 700,000 jobs take a financial hit. The shutdown could also affect services such as trash pickup, libraries, and child care, and could lead to delays in mail delivery and Amtrak train service. The potential for a shutdown has caused concern among lawmakers and economists, with some predicting that the ripple effects could be devastating to local economies and communities.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The Parker Solar Probe, originally named Solar Probe Plus, is set to launch in July 2018 on a Delta IV Heavy rocket. The spacecraft aims to get closer to the Sun than any previous probe, coming within 3.7 million miles of the Sun's surface. This unprecedented journey will allow the probe to analyze the Sun's atmosphere, particularly focusing on the mechanics of the solar wind that Parker discovered. The solar wind, consisting of highly charged particles in the form of plasma, is constantly emitted by the Sun. The Parker Solar Probe will help scientists understand how these particles are heated and accelerated, shedding light on the physics of stars and improving space weather forecasting. The spacecraft will carry a chip with pictures of Parker and a copy of his original paper on solar wind, along with a plaque for him to inscribe. The mission is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the Sun and its role in the solar system.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

The study, conducted over five years and involving 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78% higher risk of developing new onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death, compared to those with the lowest weight variability.

Coronary artery disease, the most common form of heart disease in the US, occurs when the major blood vessels supplying the heart become damaged or diseased, leading to decreased blood flow and potential chest pain, shortness of breath, or heart attack.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

{"pred": "Colorectal cancer, once considered a disease predominantly affecting older men, is increasingly being diagnosed in younger populations, according to recent studies. A University of Michigan-led analysis of national cancer registry data revealed that one in seven colorectal cancer patients was under 50 years old, challenging current guidelines suggesting screenings should begin at age 50. This finding is significant considering that younger patients are more likely to present with advanced-stage cancer, which is more dangerous than localized tumors.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Cancer, indicates that younger colorectal cancer patients are more likely to have tumors that have spread to lymph nodes or other organs. Despite this, they tend to live slightly longer without cancer recurrence compared to older patients. The aggressive treatment methods employed for younger patients might contribute to this outcome. The researchers suggest that the medical community needs to reassess its approach to colorectal cancer screening and risk assessment for younger adults.\n\nAnother study, also published in Cancer, estimated that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and over one in ten colon cancers would be diagnosed in individuals under 50. This trend underscores the need for improved risk assessment and screening strategies for younger adults, as maintaining the current recommendation of age 50 for screening could result in nearly 15% of patients being diagnosed too late.\n\nDr. Samantha Hendren, the lead author of the study, emphasized that the findings serve as a \"wake-up call\" to the medical community, highlighting the importance of recognizing colorectal cancer in younger patients. She suggested that doctors should be vigilant for symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel habits, or abdominal pain, which could indicate the need for diagnostic screening.\n\nWhile the studies suggest that younger patients might benefit from more aggressive treatment, it remains unclear whether changing screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths. The effectiveness of such a change would require further research to determine if the benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger populations challenges existing screening guidelines and highlights the need for improved risk assessment and awareness among healthcare providers. As the medical community adapts to this new reality, it must prioritize the development of targeted screening strategies and supportive care for younger colorectal cancer survivors.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

{"pred": "In recent astronomical studies, a new perspective on galactic expansion and the potential for interstellar communication has emerged. The concept revolves around the idea that advanced civilizations might harness the energy of distant stars to ensure their survival amidst the accelerating expansion of the universe. This notion builds upon the work of astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, who proposed three stages of technological advancement—Type I, II, and III—each representing a civilization's ability to utilize energy from their respective environments.\n\nDan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, has introduced a new dimension to Kardashev's model. Hooper argues that the presence of dark energy, which causes the universe to expand at an accelerating rate, poses a significant challenge for civilizations aiming to communicate with each other across vast distances. As the universe expands, the stars beyond our Local Group will eventually fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making it impossible for observers to retrieve information from them within the age of the universe.\n\nTo overcome this obstacle, Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations would engage in a process of star harvesting, capturing stars from other galaxies and using their energy to propel themselves closer to inhabited regions. This strategy would allow civilizations to secure access to the energy of stars before they become permanently inaccessible due to the expansion of the universe. The method involves deploying a vast swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, which could orbit a star, collecting its energy and transmitting it back to a nearby planet. Alternatively, these satellites could potentially use the star's energy to accelerate the entire system towards the civilization's home galaxy.\n\nHooper's proposal implies that civilizations capable of reaching Type III status, where they harness the resources of an entire galaxy, would be the most likely candidates for star harvesting. These advanced civilizations would be able to recognize the telltale signs of such activity through the unusual light signatures emitted by galaxies that have undergone this process. The light from these galaxies would be dominated by the radiation from massive stars, indicating that the useful stars have been captured and utilized by an advanced civilization.\n\nWhile the human race is currently at a relatively low stage of technological development, estimated to be around Type I or II on Kardashev's scale, the possibility of encountering alien civilizations engaged in star harvesting could be a reality in the distant future. The advent of more sophisticated instruments capable of detecting these unique light signatures could provide valuable insights into the existence and potential communication with advanced extraterrestrial civilizations.\n\nIn addition to", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

{"pred": "Recent scientific research has revealed dramatic shifts in the East African climate that may have driven advancements in toolmaking and the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives during the Middle Stone Age, approximately 320,000 years ago. This finding is based on discoveries reported in three papers published in the journal Science. The researchers, led by paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, propose that the unpredictable changes in the landscape forced early humans to forage over larger areas with increasingly smaller tools, indicating a sophisticated adaptation strategy. The oldest excavated Middle Stone Age tools, which are the oldest of their kind, date back to around 320,000 years ago, significantly earlier than previously estimated. These tools, made from obsidian sourced from far away, suggest the existence of long-distance contacts and trading among hominid populations. The researchers also found evidence of the extraction of pigments, marking the earliest known use of pigments in the archaeological record. This discovery provides insights into the complex culture and social networks of early humans, highlighting the importance of cooperation and resource exchange in their survival and evolution. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the emergence of \"modernity\" outside of Africa and suggest that components of the \"human revolution\" were present in the African Middle Stone Age, dating back to 280,000-50,000 years ago. The research underscores the role of environmental factors in driving technological and cultural innovation among early humans, providing a deeper understanding of the evolution of human behavior and cognition.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

This decision, championed by Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller, was met with ridicule and criticism on social media platforms such as Twitter. Schiller justified the move with the phrase \"courage\", suggesting that Apple was taking a bold step towards innovation rather than embracing the status quo. Critics, however, argued that this action was not courageous but rather arrogant, greedy, and stupid, as it removed a widely accepted and superior audio standard in favor of Apple's proprietary Lightning connector.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has sparked controversy due to the lack of a technological justification for the change. Wired audio connections are known to provide better sound quality compared to wireless alternatives. Users expressed frustration over the inability to simultaneously charge their iPhones and listen to music through headphones, necessitating the purchase of an additional $9 aux-to-Lightning cable dongle. The introduction of Apple's AirPods, a wireless earbud option, was also criticized for its high price point and potential for loss.\n\nFurthermore, the decision to remove the headphone jack has implications for various accessories that previously connected to the device via the jack, such as Square's credit card dongles, temperature sensors, light meters, thermal imaging cameras, and personal breathalyzers. These devices will now require proprietary Lightning connectors, adding to the cost and inconvenience for users.\n\nCritics argue that Apple's move towards a walled garden, where only Apple-approved products can connect to its devices, is akin to San Francisco's gentrification efforts, displacing lower-income residents.

The new law allows for the cultivation of up to five plants per premise and permits the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. It also enables tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad to obtain permits for buying small amounts of the substance legally. However, the government emphasizes that this does not lead to a free-for-all in the growing, transporting, dealing, or exporting of marijuana, and the security forces will continue to enforce Jamaican law in line with international obligations.\n\nThe move comes after years of debate and discussion about relaxing marijuana laws in Jamaica, influenced by changes in drug policies in the United States and other countries. The legislation is expected to boost the potential for the island to become a player in the emerging medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the development of innovative cannabis-based products. Jamaican officials hope this will contribute to economic growth, particularly in light of the country's ongoing relationship with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe new law aligns with a broader international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 U.S. states permit some form of medical marijuana, and Colorado and Washington have legalized personal use. Additionally, Uruguay has created a legal marijuana market, while Argentina decriminalized personal possession of marijuana in 2009.

{"pred": "In recent studies, NASA scientists have unveiled compelling evidence suggesting that Mars once had a massive ancient ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere, comparable in size to the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This discovery significantly alters our understanding of Mars' youth, portraying it as a warm and wet planet, with flowing streams, river deltas, and long-standing lakes present soon after its formation around 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nThe researchers, utilizing three of the world's most powerful infrared telescopes, including the Keck II telescope, the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, created maps of the Martian atmosphere over a six-year period. By analyzing the variations in different forms of water molecules in the Martian air, they were able to infer the planet's ancient water content.\n\nWater on Mars contains both standard water molecules, composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and another form with a heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. Over time, the lighter form of water escapes into space, leaving behind a higher concentration of deuterium. The scientists found that water near the Martian ice caps was enriched with deuterium, indicating that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times the volume currently stored in its frozen ice caps.\n\nCalculations suggest that the amount of water was sufficient to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of approximately 137 meters. However, Mars was likely never fully submerged; instead, the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, covering nearly a fifth of the planet's surface. This ocean persisted for millions of years until the Martian atmosphere thinned, causing more ocean water to evaporate into space, and the planet lost its insulation, leading to the eventual freezing of the remaining water.\n\nThis discovery opens the possibility that Mars was habitable for a much longer period than previously thought, potentially providing a favorable environment for the evolution of life. The search for life on Mars will intensify in 2018 with the launch of the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which will look for chemical signatures of life, possibly emanating from microbial activity deep beneath the Martian soil.\n\nWhile the existence of life on Mars remains uncertain, the new findings reinforce the notion that Mars was once a more hospitable environment, supporting the ongoing exploration and investigation into the potential for past life on the red planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "In a groundbreaking study published in the journal Evolution, researchers have challenged the traditional depiction of dinosaurs as roaring beasts, revealing that some dinosaurs may have produced sounds akin to those of birds, with closed-mouth vocalizations. This discovery, based on analyzing the vocal behaviors of living archosaurs (birds, crocodiles, and their ancestors), suggests that the capacity for such vocalizations evolved independently at least 16 times within the bird lineage, predominantly in large-bodied species. The study's findings imply that dinosaurs, like modern birds, might have utilized closed-mouth vocalizations for territorial defense or courtship displays, rather than the loud roars commonly portrayed in media.\n\nKey insights from the research include:\n\n1. **Closed-Mouth Vocalizations**: These are sounds produced through the skin in the neck area while the beak remains closed, typically involving the pushing of air into an esophageal pouch. Examples include the cooing of doves. Compared to open-mouth vocalizations, closed-mouth sounds are quieter and lower in pitch.\n\n2. **Evolutionary Origins**: The study found that closed-mouth vocalizations are not ancestral to birds but have evolved multiple times within the bird lineage, particularly in large-bodied species. This suggests that the behavior may have been associated with sexual selection, occurring alongside open-mouthed vocalizations.\n\n3. **Physical Constraints**: The research indicates that the inflation of an elastic cavity, necessary for closed-mouth vocalization, presents a size-dependent challenge, requiring higher lung pressures for smaller body sizes. This explains why closed-mouth vocalizations are more prevalent in larger birds.\n\n4. **Implications for Dinosaurs**: Given that dinosaurs were part of the archosaur group and many were large-bodied, the study suggests that some dinosaurs likely engaged in closed-mouth vocalizations, possibly during mating displays. However, direct fossil evidence of dinosaur sounds remains elusive.\n\n5. **Future Research Directions**: The collaboration plans to integrate information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to further elucidate the vocal capabilities of extinct avian species and their dinosaur ancestors.\n\nThis research transforms our understanding of dinosaur acoustics, offering a more nuanced view of their vocal behaviors and potentially enriching our perception of the prehistoric world.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

This achievement represents a major leap towards decoding internal imagery, including dreams, memories, and fantasies.\n\nThe process involved subjects spending hours in the MRI machine, where their brain activity was recorded as they watched movie trailers. The MRI data was then fed into a computer algorithm, which learned to associate specific neural patterns with visual, auditory, and other dynamic information against a vast database of random YouTube videos. When the subjects watched the same set of trailers again, the algorithm reconstructed a continuous, albeit abstract, representation of the actual videos based on the brain activity recorded earlier.\n\nThis technology is considered a significant step towards understanding how the brain processes dynamic visual experiences, potentially leading to applications in fields such as neuroprosthetics, where it could enable paralyzed individuals to control their environment through imagined movements.

The author suggests that Congress might simply adapt to the situation, such as ordering out for meals instead of preparing them themselves, and continues to allocate funds for military spending despite the Pentagon's lack of need for some of these expenditures.\n\nIn summary, the articles highlight contrasting perspectives on the House's legislative priorities, the use of sequestration as a tool for fiscal discipline, and the disconnect between the severity of potential budget cuts and the impact on congressional salaries.

{"pred": "Summary:\n\nOn Tuesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a vocal critic of the financial sector, targeted Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf during a Senate hearing, demanding his resignation and suggesting criminal investigations into the bank's practices. Warren criticized Stumpf for allegedly making millions from a \"scam\" involving the creation of millions of unauthorized customer accounts, which led to a $185 million penalty for the bank. She accused Stumpf of failing to hold himself and other executives accountable for the company's actions, labeling his leadership as \"gutless.\"\n\nWarren questioned Stumpf on whether he regarded the case as one of fraud, if the bank would claw back any payments made to former executive Carrie Tolstedt, and how the bank would assist customers affected by the fake accounts. Stumpf responded that he lacked the necessary expertise in law, compensation, and credit consultancy. Warren also highlighted Stumpf's role in promoting cross-selling, a practice that she argued was central to the bank's growth and his personal wealth.\n\nStumpf's testimony was marked by a visibly injured right hand, which he attributed to an accident with his grandchildren. During the hearing, Warren accused Stumpf of exploiting employees to commit fraud, driving up the bank's stock price, and enriching himself at the expense of customers. She demanded that Stumpf resign, return the profits gained during the scam, and face criminal investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump was expected to announce his intention to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move that would likely complicate the peace process between Israel and Palestine. Trump's decision was seen as a compromise, as he would sign another six-month waiver to delay the relocation of the US embassy to Jerusalem. However, this decision faced criticism from international leaders, including Pope Francis, who called for respect for the status quo in Jerusalem. The announcement coincided with a broader shift in Middle East politics, with Saudi Arabia reportedly presenting a peace plan that favored Israel, potentially undermining the prospects for a fair broker in negotiations between Israel and Palestine.", "answers": ["Sen.

{"pred": "The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, has utilized statistical tools, particularly Bayesian statistics, to refine and focus the search efforts. Bayesian statisticians employ methods that allow for the updating of estimates of the probability of finding the target in any given location, taking into account factors such as flight path, wind patterns, ocean currents, and areas already searched. This approach helps in narrowing down the search area and improving the chances of locating the aircraft.\n\nBayesian inference involves assessing the likelihood of various scenarios and combining them to determine the most probable solution. It allows for the incorporation of new information and the adjustment of probabilities accordingly. In the case of the Air France Flight 447, which disappeared in 2009, Bayesian methods were instrumental in pinpointing the wreckage after multiple unsuccessful searches. The technique proved effective in accounting for uncertainties and contradictions in the data, leading to a successful recovery of the plane.\n\nHowever, the application of Bayesian statistics in the current search for Flight 370 faces several challenges. These include the lack of comprehensive data on the plane's location, the complexity of the search area due to ocean currents, and the evolving nature of the search hypotheses. The method relies heavily on subjective judgments and assumptions, which can influence the outcomes. Additionally, the vastness of the search area and the potential for the plane to have traveled significant distances make the search extremely challenging.\n\nDespite the potential benefits of Bayesian statistics, there are concerns about the interpretation and misuse of probabilistic results. Arnold I. Barnett, a statistician, warns that the numerical estimates derived from Bayesian methods are themselves subject to uncertainty and may be taken more seriously than warranted. This highlights the importance of clear communication and understanding of the limitations of statistical analyses in complex search operations.\n\nIn conclusion, while Bayesian statistics offer a structured approach to refine search efforts and improve the chances of locating missing aircraft, the application in the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is complicated by numerous challenges. The effectiveness of the method depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the data, the accuracy of assumptions, and the ability to adapt to new information as it becomes available. The search continues, with the hope that advancements in technology and analytical methods will eventually lead to the discovery of the missing aircraft.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

{"pred": "Robin Williams, a beloved actor and comedian, passed away at the age of 63. His career spanned decades, with a notable shift in the 1990s when he began focusing on entertainment for children. This change resonated particularly with younger audiences, including those in their mid-to-late 20s and early 30s, who grew up watching his films. Williams' most iconic role was as the Genie in \"Aladdin,\" which became a VHS classic in the 1990s, thanks to his distinctive voice and the imaginative quality he brought to the character. Other memorable performances include his portrayal of a voice actor in \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" a man trapped in a board game in \"Jumanji,\" and a boy trapped in an adult body in \"Jack.\"\n\nWilliams' legacy extends beyond his film career, as he was known for his generosity and willingness to please his audience, often going to great lengths to make them laugh. His ability to connect with children and bring joy to their lives was a significant part of his appeal. Despite his success in serious projects later in his career, it was his work in family films that left a lasting imprint on younger generations.\n\nPersonal anecdotes from those who knew Williams highlight his unique personality and the profound impact he had on others. One such story recounts a meeting with Williams in 1978, when he was still an unknown comedian, and how his performance at the Comedy Store left a lasting impression. This encounter connects to the tragic nature of his death, as the author reflects on the irony of a man who brought so much joy to others facing such a difficult end.\n\nIn summary, Robin Williams was a versatile and influential figure in the entertainment industry, whose work continues to resonate with audiences, especially those who grew up with his films.

Activists and Human Rights Watch reported numerous arrests and fatalities due to a subsequent crackdown by security forces.

The police managed to reopen blocked streets for morning rush-hour commuters, but the encampment remained at City Hall Park, with about 2,000 protesters and 400 tents. The city officials announced that they would allow the encampment to stay until at least daybreak, but about two hours after the eviction deadline had passed, police commanders said they would permit the encampment to stay until at least daybreak. The police began to make their presence known as the mayor's eviction deadline passed, and the protesters' mood turned from calm and festive to rowdy. The police confronted each other overnight but except for some debris thrown by protesters at one point, there was no violence. The police used pepper spray and bean-bag projectiles to disperse the crowd, and four people were arrested. The city has been relatively accommodating to its Occupy group compared to other major cities, with Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa providing ponchos to campers when it rained. However, after the collapse of negotiations aimed at persuading protesters to relocate voluntarily, the mayor said last week the encampment would have to go. The mayor complimented the protesters on Sunday for staying peaceful, but he added in a statement: \"It is time for Occupy LA to move from focusing their efforts to hold a particular patch of park land to spreading the message of economic justice and restoration of balance to American society.\" The city hopes to avoid the sporadic violence that erupted in other cities when police used force against Occupy protesters.", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park.

{"pred": "The article discusses the life and legacy of Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the iconic AK-47 assault rifle. Kalashnikov, born in 1925 in Russia, developed the rifle during World War II, which saw the Red Army's severe shortage of weapons. After the war, Kalashnikov became disillusioned with the Soviet government's policies and began working on a more efficient and versatile weapon. He eventually founded the Kalashnikov Design Bureau, where he worked on the development of the AK-47, which became a symbol of resistance against Soviet rule.\n\nKalashnikov's letter to the Russian Orthodox Church, dated May 2012, expresses his deep regret for the deaths caused by the AK-47, particularly those of innocent civilians. He writes that he feels morally responsible for the deaths, despite the fact that the weapon was designed to defend his country and not to be used by terrorists. Kalashnikov attributes his guilt to his own desire for power and control, stating that he believed he was serving God and the Fatherland by creating the AK-47.\n\nDespite his guilt, Kalashnikov did not seek forgiveness from the Church or any other authority figure. Instead, he chose to share his thoughts and feelings through a letter to the Russian Orthodox Church, which was published in Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin newspaper. The letter reveals a complex inner turmoil and moral dilemma faced by Kalashnikov, as he grapples with the consequences of his actions and the impact they have had on society.\n\nThe letter also highlights the enduring influence of the AK-47 on modern warfare and armed conflict. Despite its brevity, Kalashnikov's words resonate with many readers, as they reflect the ongoing debate about the morality of military intervention and the role of technology in shaping global politics.\n\nIn conclusion, the article profiles the life and legacy of Mikhail Kalashnikov, a designer of the AK-47 assault rifle who faced profound guilt and moral responsibility for its creation. Through his letter to the Russian Orthodox Church, Kalashnikov reflects on the impact of his weapon on society and the broader implications of technological advancements in warfare. The story serves as a reminder of the complexities of human nature and the ethical dilemmas that arise when pursuing power and control through violence and innovation.", "answers": ["In our own obituary of AK-47 inventor Mikhail Kalashnikov last month, we included this quote: The rifle was invented \"for the protection of the Motherland,\" he said. \"I have no regrets and bear no responsibility for how politicians have used it.\" It turns out \"no regrets\" might not have exactly been true. The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

McCullough was convicted in the 1957 abduction and killing of Maria Ridulph, a 7-year-old schoolgirl from Sycamore, Illinois. The case was widely publicized in the 1950s due to its age and lack of physical evidence tying McCullough to the crime. However, a new trial was ordered by a judge in Sycamore, Illinois, after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. The hearing was presided over by Judge William P. Brady, who ruled that McCullough was released and granted him a new trial. McCullough's lawyers and DeKalb County state's attorney Richard Schmack argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. Schmack concluded that he'd found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough had been convicted of a crime he didn't commit.

The researchers applied a second way of measuring importance, CheiRank, which measures the PageRank of an article based on the number of incoming and outgoing links, while the CheiRank of an article is proportional to the number of outgoing links. The result was that the world's most influential mind was Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, beating out everyone, including the Pope, President Obama, Frank Sinatra, Hitler, Caesar, and Jesus. The study suggests that the internet archive can help fix broken links on the web by preserving references to archived pages and putting them in place of broken links or companion links.

Since January 1, 2016, the CDC has confirmed 50 cases of AFM in 24 states, compared to just 21 cases in 2015. The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections like polio and non-polio enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Enteroviruses are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children, such as respiratory infections. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. The symptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The best prevention is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM. The illness seems to peak in 2014, with 120 cases reported between August and December, all children. The median age for children stricken with AFM is 7, and many had to be placed on respirators.

The shroud, which is currently displayed in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, has been radiocarbon dated to between 1260 and 1390 CE, making it one of the oldest known pieces of clothing associated with Jesus. The shroud is widely regarded as an icon, not a genuine religious relic, and has been the subject of debate and scrutiny for decades.\n\nIn 2015, more than 2 million people visited the Shroud during a three-month display in Turin, including Pope Francis. The bloodstain pattern investigation, led by Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom, aimed to determine the bloodstains on the shroud's surface and their alignment to each other. The researchers tested the bloodstains on different body parts depicted on the cloth, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back, as well as a belt of blood at the waist. They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on the shroud, comparing the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction seen on the linen. They observed that the bloodstains are not consistent with any single pose, indicating that a standing model was used to create the patterns. The researchers also found that the bloodstains do not match the expected patterns for a crucified man or a facedown corpse, further supporting the idea that the shroud is a medieval fraud.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse, adding to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Microsoft's announcement comes as the company faces competition from Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation Move, which also offer motion-controlled gaming systems. With the launch of Kinect, Microsoft aims to position itself as a leader in the motion-sensing controller market and compete with established consoles like the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

Davis sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind, and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery. Despite the risks, Davis ultimately decided to terminate the pregnancy, citing the baby's suffering and the potential for complications. The memoir also covers Davis' previous pregnancies, including an ectopic pregnancy in 1994, where an embryo implants outside the uterus, and the termination of the ectopic pregnancy in 1996, which was considered medically necessary. Davis' filibuster in June 2013 set off a chaotic scene in the Texas Capitol that extended past midnight, with thousands of people watching it online. The memoir details Davis' experience and the challenges she faced in navigating the abortion debate in Texas, including the opposition of anti-abortion groups and the need to balance her personal story with the broader issue of reproductive rights. Davis' memoir is expected to shed light on her life story and the experiences that shaped her political career, particularly her fight against tighter abortion restrictions and her decision to become a mother twice. The book's title comes from a Lady Bird Johnson quote, \"Become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid,\" highlighting Davis' commitment to fighting for women's rights and her belief in the importance of personal stories in shaping public opinion. The book's publication follows Davis' trail in the governor's race against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to replace Republican Gov. Rick Perry next year. The book's cover features a dedication to Davis' daughters, Amber and Dru, and Tate, her first child from her first marriage, who taught her a love deeper than she believed was possible. The memoir also includes details about Davis' relationships with her parents, including her sympathy for her mother, the stalwart caregiver, and her father, who left the family in tough financial straits when they divorced and pursued his dream of community theater.

The feathers were well-preserved on a nearly complete skeleton, revealing intricate structures such as platelet-like nanostructures and the presence of melanosomes within the feathers. The researchers analyzed the feathers using a combination of scanning electron microscopy and discriminant function analysis, identifying the iridescent colors as blue, pink, and purple.

The show featured the duo traveling around the UK in their motorcycle-sidecar, discussing various dishes and topics related to food and cuisine. Dickson Wright was a talented cook and a passionate food historian, known for her unconventional approach to cooking and her ability to make complex recipes accessible to viewers. She was also a champion of hunting and shooting, and her views on vegetarianism were often criticized for being unorthodox. Despite her controversial comments about hunting, Dickson Wright was a beloved figure in the culinary world and was widely respected for her intelligence, humor, and dedication to her craft. She was survived by her two sisters, Heather and June, and her agent, Heather Holden-Brown and Elly James. Dickson Wright's legacy lives on through her books, including \"A History of English Food,\" which chronicled her experiences as a cook and a campaigner for rural life.

{"pred": "Seattle's new sugary drink tax, which was introduced in 2018, has had a significant impact on the city's economy and residents' purchasing habits. The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold, making it more expensive for consumers. The tax applies to soda, sports drinks, kombucha, and other sugary beverages that don't list milk as their first ingredient. The tax has led to a decrease in sales of these products, especially at Costco, which saw a 34% decline in sales of beverages affected by the tax. The tax also impacted local businesses, with some retailers experiencing higher prices and decreased sales. The tax has been met with criticism from some residents who feel that it disproportionately affects low-income families and discriminates against certain groups. The tax has also triggered numerous lawsuits, including a lawsuit against the county to get the tax thrown out days before it was to take effect. Despite the backlash, the beverage industry has supported the tax, arguing that it helps combat obesity and diabetes and drives down health care costs. However, the tax has also faced criticism for excluding certain types of sugary drinks, such as those sold at Starbucks, and for not applying to food stamp purchases. The tax has also been criticized for being poorly designed and confusing, with some retailers misapplying the tax and causing confusion among consumers. Overall, the tax has had a mixed impact on Seattle, with some businesses benefiting from increased revenue and others facing challenges related to higher prices and reduced sales.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

{"pred": "A new study conducted in Denmark has suggested that pregnant women who frequently take acetaminophen, a common pain reliever, may be at a higher risk of having children later diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and related conditions. The study analyzed data from the Danish National Birth Cohort study between 1996 and 2002, which included over 64,000 children. The researchers found that women who took acetaminophen more than twice per week had a 29% higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD, compared to women who took it less frequently. Additionally, women who reported taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy had a 50% increased risk of receiving ADHD medication.\n\nThe study authors attributed the increased risk to acetaminophen's potential interference with maternal hormones that are crucial for fetal brain development. They cited a previous study done using acetaminophen in rats and a study of acetaminophen and autism done with humans, both of which suggested that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by affecting the development of the brain.\n\nThe study authors emphasized the importance of not taking a drug's safety during pregnancy for granted, pointing out that there are nonpharmacological ways to deal with pain, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture. They also suggested that pregnant women should consider alternative pain management strategies, such as avoiding acetaminophen altogether or taking it only when necessary.\n\nThe study's authors acknowledged that the findings do not show a clear cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development, and that more research is needed to fully understand the link. They recommended that pregnant women consult their doctors before taking any medication, especially if they are concerned about the potential risks.\n\nIn conclusion, the study highlights the importance of considering the potential risks of acetaminophen during pregnancy and advises pregnant women to avoid taking it more frequently unless absolutely necessary. The study's findings suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD and related conditions in children, emphasizing the need for further research to better understand the link between the drug and its impact on fetal brain development.", "answers": ["The bad news about acetaminophen just keeps on coming: A new study finds that use of the drug during pregnancy is linked to \"ADHD-like behavioral problems\" in children, CNN reports.

So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The Parker Solar Probe, named after Parker, will be launched in July 2018 and aim to study the sun's atmosphere, particularly the solar wind, and its impact on the Earth's magnetic field. The spacecraft will travel to within 4 million miles of the sun's surface, the furthest ever traveled by a spacecraft, and will be equipped with a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from the intense heat and radiation of the sun. The Parker Solar Probe will also have a heat shield that will allow the spacecraft to operate at room temperature, enabling scientists to study the sun's behavior and understand the physics behind its formation. The mission will involve a series of flybys of Venus, which will allow the spacecraft to observe the sun's corona and gain a better understanding of the solar wind's acceleration and the mechanisms that generate it. The Parker Solar Probe will also study the solar wind's impact on the Earth's magnetic field, which is essential for maintaining the stability of the solar system. The mission aims to answer fundamental questions about the sun, including its origins, composition, and behavior, and to develop new technologies to mitigate the effects of space weather on critical infrastructures and services. The Parker Solar Probe will be the first mission to study the sun's outermost atmosphere, known as the corona, and will provide valuable insights into the solar wind's acceleration and the mechanisms that drive it. The mission will also contribute to our understanding of the sun's magnetic field, which is critical for maintaining the stability of the solar system and protecting critical infrastructure from the effects of space weather. The Parker Solar Probe's findings will have significant implications for space weather forecasting and help inform the development of new technologies to mitigate the effects of space weather on our planet.

The attack was carried out by a sophisticated malware program that was installed in Target's point-of-sale (POS) systems, allowing the attackers to steal credit and debit card data without detection. The malware was able to infiltrate Target's networks and steal data from the point of sale, which was then used to make unauthorized purchases using the stolen credentials. The attack was initially detected in July 2015, but it took until December 2016 for the full extent of the breach to be revealed. The report from computer firm iSight, hired by the US Secret Service, detailed the type of software used in the attack, including memory scraping capabilities, and the regions where software expertise exists to create the malware. The report also highlighted the operational sophistication of the compromise activity, suggesting that the attackers demonstrated innovation and a high degree of skill in orchestrating the various components of the attack. The report concluded that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cybercrooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach in the future.

The new planet, estimated to be between five and ten times the mass of Earth, orbits beyond Neptune's path and has not been directly observed. The researchers behind the discovery, Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have used mathematical and computer modeling to establish its existence based on the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. They predict that Planet Nine could have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational forces of Jupiter or Saturn, and its existence challenges the traditional definition of a planet as a celestial body that has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked debates about Pluto's status, with some arguing for its reinstatement as a planet and others advocating for its demotion due to its recent demotion. However, Brown and Batygin maintain that the IAU's decision to classify Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006 was a necessary step to address the inconsistencies in the solar system's definition. They argue that Planet Nine's presence challenges the notion that Pluto is the only planet in the solar system with a distinct orbit and that it could potentially play a crucial role in shaping the orbits of other objects in the outer solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also raised questions about the implications of its existence for the solar system's overall structure and evolution. Brown and Batygin emphasize that the planet's existence could have profound consequences for the orbits of nearby dwarf planets and other small bodies, potentially altering the distribution of mass and energy in the solar system. They predict that Planet Nine's presence could lead to the formation of a new type of object in the outer solar system, which could have implications for the stability and dynamics of the solar system.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding the discovery, the debate over Planet Nine's status remains ongoing. Some scientists argue that it should remain a planet, while others advocate for its demotion due to its recent demotion. The controversy has been fueled by the historical context of Pluto's demotion, which occurred in 2006, and the perceived inconsistency in the solar system's definition of a planet. The discovery of Planet Nine has reignited interest in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system beyond Neptune's orbit, and has raised questions about the potential existence of other potentially habitable exoplanets in this region.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of Planet Nine represents a significant milestone in", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

The study involved 9,509 men and women with stable CAD, monitoring their weight over an average of 12 visits. The median body weight variation over the period was 3.8 pounds per visit, and the researchers adjusted for various risk factors before comparing the weight variability of the two groups: those with the lowest weight variability (one-fifth) and those with the highest.\n\nThe study found that individuals with the highest weight variability had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability. The researchers attributed this difference to the fact that the one-fifth with the highest weight variability experienced larger fluctuations in body weight over the study period, leading to a higher likelihood of experiencing adverse cardiovascular events.\n\nYo-yo dieting refers to the repeated cycles of weight loss and weight gain, often accompanied by periods of rapid weight fluctuations. Previous studies have suggested a link between yo-yo dieting and poor heart health, including an increased risk of death from heart disease. However, this new study adds to the existing evidence by demonstrating that yo-yo dieting may have severe health implications for individuals with pre-existing CAD, particularly those who experience large fluctuations in body weight.\n\nThe study's findings raise concerns about the potential role of gut microbiota in triggering weight fluctuations in individuals with CAD.

The statement also highlighted the human suffering caused by modern standards of living in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nRicks' document was based on local expertise and the knowledge of his colleagues, who had experienced similar events in the Lower Ninth Ward section of the city. Despite his efforts to validate each statement, Ricks ultimately decided not to remove any of them due to their validity in the context of the situation. The warning message was disseminated through various media outlets, including NBC News headquarters in New York and across the United States, and was seen as a crucial piece of communication during the storm's peak.\n\nThe impact of the warning message was significant, as it helped to mobilize residents and emergency responders to prepare for the storm and minimize its destructive effects. Many families and businesses were forced to evacuate, and the Superdome, a major sports venue, was transformed into a makeshift shelter for thousands of displaced individuals. The warning message played a vital role in saving countless lives and helping to prevent further loss of life and property.\n\nIn addition to the warning message, Ricks' colleague Gary Szatkowski's \"personal plea\" during Hurricane Sandy's New York City-area landfall in 2012, which included gut-wrenching statements such as \"if you are still reluctant (to evacuate), think about your loved ones,\" earned him hero status. His words resonated with many people, highlighting the importance of preparedness and empathy in times of crisis.\n\nOverall, the National Weather Service's decision to issue the \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE\" and the subsequent dissemination of the warning message through multiple channels played a crucial role in mitigating the impact of Hurricane Katrina and saving countless lives. The legacy of this iconic warning message continues to serve as a reminder of the importance of timely and accurate communication during extreme weather events.", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day. That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

The film is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"strong violence and pervasive language,\" and it follows the story of three young Black men who were shot and killed during a police siege at the Motiv City's Algiers Motel. The film is based on the book \"The Algiers Motel Incident\" by John Hersey, but it deviates significantly from the actual events, including the acquittal of the police officers involved and the lack of a clear explanation for the deaths. The film's depiction of the police as racists and the violence they commit is disturbing and has sparked controversy and debate. The film's protagonist, Melvin Dismukes, a private security guard, is portrayed as a victim of police brutality, and the film explores the impact of systemic racism on Black communities in the United States.

The board statement also mentioned that the board had \"openly discussed\" the possibility of a private sale, but did not specify the timeline or the amount of funding required for the transaction. The board statement also raised questions about the timing and transparency of the announcement, with some board members suggesting that the announcement was irregular and that Musk had other motives for disclosing the potential de-listing. The board statement also noted that Tesla shares had reached a peak of $368 after Musk's tweets on Tuesday, before trading on the stock market was halted. The board members issued a statement shortly after the meeting, stating that they would consider the proposal and that the board would form a committee to evaluate the bid.

Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev first proposed these three phases of galactic expansion in 1962 as a way to measure the energy consumption of increasingly powerful societies. A recent paper posted on the preprint journal arXiv.org has revived Kardashev's model and added a new, apocalyptic twist, suggesting that any sufficiently advanced civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will expand throughout the universe, attempting to secure as many stars as possible before they become permanently inaccessible due to the encroaching horizon caused by dark energy. To capture stars from other galaxies, scientists propose using a swarm of satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" which would create a spherical shell around a star and harness the power of its energy. The satellites would be made of satellites, such as solar-powered ones, and would be capable of capturing and harvesting energy from the star before it becomes inaccessible forever. The discovery of such advanced civilizations could lead to the search for alien civilizations that are thousands, or even millions, of years older than humanity, and the possibility of detecting their unique light signatures through the detection of infrared radiation emitted by their star systems.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The show was initially launched in 1996 as a mockumentary-style news show, featuring humorous headlines and interviews with guests. The show's format was designed to poke fun at traditional news coverage, often incorporating elements of satire and parody.\n\nDuring the Kilborn era, The Daily Show shifted its focus from creating news to making light of it, with Stewart and his team pushing for a more pointed and serious approach. This shift led to a change in the show's jokes, with Stewart and his writers crafting jokes that were more intelligent and focused on issues rather than simply providing entertainment value.\n\nIn 1999, Jon Stewart took over as host, and the show underwent significant changes, including a shift towards a more satirical tone. Stewart and his team introduced new correspondents, such as Vance DeGeneres, who became a major figure in the creative life of the show. The introduction of new writers and producers, including Ben Karlin, also contributed to the evolution of the show's style and content.\n\nOne notable development in the early years of The Daily Show was the hiring of David Jones, a gifted writer who would later become the show's first head writer. Jones brought a fresh perspective to the show, emphasizing the importance of a point of view and the need for individual jokes that were funny, intelligent, and rooted in reality.\n\nAs The Daily Show continued to evolve, the show faced challenges, particularly in the form of conflicts with existing writers and correspondents. One notable incident occurred in 1998, when the show's writers were upset that Stewart had taken over the hosting duties, leading to a heated confrontation with some of the previous Kilborn writers. This incident, known as the \"fuck-you meeting,\" was eventually leaked to the New York Post, highlighting the tensions between the show's creators and the network's management.\n\nDespite these challenges, The Daily Show continued to thrive, with Stewart and his team maintaining a close relationship with the writers and producers. In 2000, Stewart's hiring of David Jones marked a significant milestone in the show's evolution, as Jones became the show's first head writer and helped establish a new tone and approach to the show's content.\n\nOver the years, The Daily Show continued to evolve, with the addition of new correspondents and contributors, as well as a shift towards a more satirical and irreverent approach.

{"pred": "The discovery of ancient Middle Stone Age tools in Kenya, dating back to around 320,000 years ago, provides new insights into the development of early human societies in the region. The oldest tools, consisting mainly of hand axes, were shaped like tear drops with rounded ends and pointed eyes, indicating a focus on cutting and processing plant material. The next technological revolution, marked by the emergence of Middle Stone Age implements, occurred tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought, suggesting that early humans began developing it even earlier than previously thought. The team of international scientists found that the Middle Stone Age tools were made from obsidian that originated from at least 25 to 50 kilometers away from the excavation sites, while the pigment lumps, including two pieces with grinding marks, were from an undetermined distance outside the Olorgesailie vicinity. The team's findings challenge the traditional view that modernity arose outside of Africa and suggest that some hominin groups were already adapting technologically and culturally to cope with the unpredictable changes in food sources and environmental conditions. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools in the Olorgesailie Basin provides evidence of complex behaviors and transmission of information and technological innovation, challenging the distinction between modern humans and archaic humans based on culture, art, and treatment of the dead. The research highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between complex behaviors and hominin species from 500,000 years to 160,000 years ago, when many species of hominins inhabited the African landscape. The findings suggest that gradual complex change is more difficult to interpret than revolution, and that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern never was, as evidenced by the earlier appearance of Middle Stone Age technology in the region.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

On Saturday, Trump tweeted that his social media use is \"modern-day presidential,\" less than an hour after accusing the media of trying to convince lawmakers that he should stop using Twitter. The tweet came after Trump attacked \"Morning Joe\" co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, and some Republicans expressed concerns about his habit of tweeting incendiary content.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised that he would become \"so presidential\" that he would come back as a presidential person, but this sentiment has been met with skepticism. In a speech in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in February 2016, Trump said he didn't want to act presidential \"quite yet,\" but promised that he would become \"so presidential that you people will be so bored, and I will come back as a presidential person.\"\n\nSince entering the White House, Trump has faced numerous controversies related to his social media use, including accusations of cyberbullying, harassment, and even threats against individuals. In December 2020, he was criticized for sharing a graphic image of a 2007 WWE incident where he body-slammed and repeatedly punched WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, which he used to make a political statement. This tweet was widely condemned by critics, who argued that it was inappropriate and potentially harmful.\n\nIn addition to his controversial tweets, Trump has also faced criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the early stages of the pandemic, he downplayed the severity of the virus and promoted conspiracy theories about its origins and effectiveness. This led to widespread confusion and mistrust among the public, and he was eventually forced to issue a public apology for his role in spreading misinformation.\n\nOverall, President Trump's use of social media has been a subject of ongoing debate and scrutiny, with many criticizing his behavior for its potential impact on public trust and safety. As the president continues to navigate these issues, it remains to be seen how his social media use will evolve and whether he will be able to maintain his position as a leader in the digital age.", "answers": ["President Trump escalated his Twitter war with CNN on Sunday, and in the process sparked more concern that he is advocating the use of violence against members of the media, the Hill reports.

They say the day after a Born Killers scene in which the girl sat on Sizemore's lap, she told her parents that he had touched her inappropriately, possibly putting his finger inside her. \"At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited.

Kieran was born deaf with small lobes where his ears should have been, and he has since moved to a school with a deafness unit in every year group. Despite his hearing loss, Kieran has gradually been able to hear through a hearing aid and can communicate with his family and teachers through lip-reading. Kieran's mother, Louise Sorkin, expressed her desire for Kieran to look like his friends and wear sunglasses and earphones. However, the surgery to create the ears was considered cosmetic and not to improve hearing. The procedure involved removing cartilage from six of Kieran's ribs and shaping them into frameworks for his ears. The surgeons used an outline of Louise Sorkin's ears as a \"family template\" to make the ears as close as possible to the ear shape that Kieran might otherwise have had. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia and lasted for six hours. The procedure brought huge psychological benefits, including improved confidence and self-esteem, as well as a boost in academic performance. Researchers at the University College London Institute for Child Health are working on developing stem cells from patients' fat tissue to create a new ear, which could potentially revolutionize the field of reconstructive surgery. The Institute plans to conduct clinical trials in the next decade to test the effectiveness of this approach.

The court hearing is scheduled for May 27, where the judge will hear legal arguments regarding whether Hercules and Leo should remain at Stony Brook.

The Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals, making it illegal to import illegally harvested wood. However, Gibson has maintained that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law. The company has denied the allegations of trafficking, stating that all of its imports from Madagascar have been legal.

The ocean, which is composed of water with a higher proportion of deuterium compared to Earth's ocean, was discovered through a series of measurements of sunlight reflected off the Martian surface and through the atmosphere.

The data suggests that the ocean may have formed in the northern hemisphere, with a consistently lower altitude, and that it was much warmer than it is today due to the presence of heavy hydrogen. The findings challenge previous beliefs that Mars was a dry and inhospitable planet, and they provide evidence for the possibility of life existing on the Red Planet.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

This decision means that Kit Kat will lose its EU trademark, but it leaves open the possibility of future challenges to protect the shape in other EU countries. The ruling follows a long-running legal battle between Nestlé and Mondelez over the shape of the four-fingered wafer biscuits, which has been a source of controversy and competition in the chocolate industry. The case highlights the importance of protecting trademarks in the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets and consumer recognition of a particular shape can be crucial for businesses seeking to establish themselves in the region.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer model that matches features of YouTube videos, such as colors, shapes, and movements, with patterns of brain activity. By analyzing brain activity during YouTube viewing sessions, the team was able to reconstruct the videos as blurry, dreamlike reconstructions of the actual videos. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize fields such as neuroscience, where it could potentially reveal insights into our dreams, memories, and even fantasies.\n\nThe study involved participants who watched two sets of movie trailers for several hours at a time using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. The MRI captured the amount of blood flowing through the visual cortex, the part of the brain responsible for processing visual information. The researchers then used this data to train a computer model that matched neural activity to the dynamic visual experiences, learning to associate certain patterns with specific features of the videos.\n\nTo reconstruct the videos, the team developed a computer-based algorithm that ran the brain activity data backward through the model to identify the features that corresponded to the videos. The resulting reconstructions were blurry due to the layers of YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity pattern. However, the researchers claim that the technology has the potential to provide a glimpse into the movies in our minds, offering a new perspective on how the brain processes visual experiences.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the brain's visual system is composed of multiple modules, each performing a distinct function. By studying brain activity during YouTube viewing, the researchers hope to gain a deeper understanding of how the brain processes visual information and how it relates to various aspects of our lives, including dreams, memories, and intentions.\n\nWhile the technology has the potential to revolutionize fields such as forensic science and criminal investigation, it remains unclear whether the reconstructed images could also be used to watch people's dreams or memories, especially when compared to the real thing. The accuracy of the reconstructions relies on the quality of the brain wave recordings obtained through electrodes on the scalp, which can flip a switch to control a switch on a computer monitor. While the technology has shown promise in controlling paralysis patients, the potential applications of this technology in court cases would depend on the nature of memories and the limitations imposed by the technology itself.\n\nOverall, the latest research in brain visualization holds great promise for advancing our understanding of the human mind and its ability to process and visualize dynamic visual experiences.

The report includes a timeline contrasting the story presented by top Obama administration officials with the actual events that transpired. The timeline highlights the differing perspectives and actions taken by the administration, emphasizing the role of the White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough in leading the call with President al Magariaf. The report also finds that a State Department official raised concerns about the need for uniformity in the military's appearance, particularly regarding the use of civilian clothing. The second article focuses on the supplemental report released by the House Select Committee, which adds context to the initial report by providing additional details about the call between Secretary Clinton and President al Magariaf, including the purpose of the call and the discussion surrounding the video. The report emphasizes the administration's misrepresentation of the attack as a protest, rather than a terrorist attack, and the role of the White House in shaping the narrative.

Elijah Cummings accusing the panel of being politically motivated and failing to provide access to crucial intelligence evidence.

How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

Egeland, who was convicted of mortgage fraud in 2014, had his sentence extended by three years and 10 months, bringing his total prison term to ten years. The extension was based on Egeland's guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the elaborate insurance scam, and for interstate failure to pay child support. Egeland had arranged for his son, Rylan Egeland, to shoot him in the leg with a shotgun on July 31, 2014, hoping to delay his prison sentence and benefit from a fraudulent disability insurance policy he had applied for seven days earlier. However, the son accidentally shot Egeland in his lower legs and left the scene. Egeland called 911 and claimed he was a victim of assault when he stopped to help a pregnant motorist. He told authorities he was suddenly hit in the head and shot along the side of the road. Egeland previously had pleaded guilty to fraud charges for his role in the Desert Sun housing scandal that rocked Central Oregon in 2009.

In 2014, Egeland was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the mortgage-fraud scheme, orchestrated through the housing development company where he worked as vice-president.

The incident highlights the dangers of financial fraud and the importance of reporting such schemes to law enforcement.

The investigation centers on the creation of a fake login page that was used to gain access to the party's voter database, which contains sensitive information such as names, addresses, and voting records. The attack was discovered by a cloud service provider and a security research firm, who reported that the fake page was created in an attempt to gather usernames and passwords that would allow access to the party's database.\n\nAccording to a Democratic source, the DNC was notified of the attack in the early hours of Tuesday morning by a cloud service provider and a security research firm. The source stated that the fake login page was designed to look like the access page that Democratic Party officials and campaigns across the country use to log into a service called Votebuilder, which hosts the database. The fake page contained a link that led users to a website with a login form, where they were asked to enter their username and password. However, the login form was actually a phishing scam designed to trick users into providing their login credentials.\n\nThe FBI is currently investigating the incident, and the DCI, Bob Lord, has emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant in preventing future attacks. He has called the voter file \"the party's most sensitive information\" and highlighted the vulnerabilities of many systems in the digital age, including those used for voter registration, party organization, and election-related activities.\n\nIn addition to the DNC, the FBI has also been monitoring the activities of foreign and domestic actors using social media to influence elections. The agency has detected attempts to breach think tanks and other institutions that provide critical information about politics and public opinion. These efforts include the creation of fake websites and the distribution of disinformation through social media platforms.\n\nThe FBI has warned political groups and government organizations to be aware of these tactics and take steps to protect their networks and data. Microsoft, a technology giant, has confirmed that it had detected a series of cyberattacks targeting the Senate and conservative think tanks in the United States, using fake websites to collect usernames and passwords. Facebook, another major social media platform, has also revealed that it had uncovered other disinformation efforts targeting people around the world.\n\nOverall, the recent cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee highlights the growing threat posed by cybercriminals and foreign actors to the integrity of democratic processes.

The majority of these individuals reside in developing countries, where obesity rates are particularly high. The study, conducted by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, provides the most comprehensive assessment of obesity worldwide over the past several decades. The report shows that obesity rates have risen significantly in all regions, with the highest rates occurring in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands. The study also highlights the role of economic factors, such as access to affordable, unhealthy food and sedentary lifestyles, in contributing to the obesity epidemic. The prevalence of obesity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, leading to approximately 3.4 million deaths annually. The study found that obesity rates have increased by 28% in adults and 47% in children during the 33-year period studied, surpassing the total world population of 1927. The researchers noted that obesity is a complex problem that affects people of all ages, incomes, and regions, with no single country achieving significant progress in reducing its obesity rate. The study suggests that obesity is not a cosmetic issue, but rather a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality, and that addressing the issue requires a multifaceted approach involving policy changes, lifestyle modifications, and public awareness campaigns. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and propose solutions, with a report expected to be released in early 2015. The study underscores the urgent need for action to address the obesity crisis and reduce the burden of chronic diseases associated with obesity.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

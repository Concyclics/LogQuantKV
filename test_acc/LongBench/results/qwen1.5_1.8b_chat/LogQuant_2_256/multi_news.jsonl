The suspect was shot four times by airport police officers, including a 29-year-old officer who administered first aid to Ciancia. The suspect was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years.

{"pred": "Seattle's new $1.75-cent-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages has sparked controversy and debate among residents and businesses alike. The tax, which applies to beverages that list milk as their primary ingredient, has led to a dramatic increase in prices at major retailers like Costco, causing many to shift their business to nearby stores. The tax has also had negative impacts on small businesses and retailers, with some reporting a 34% decrease in sales of sugary drinks and a 47% decline in sales of beverages affected by the tax in Seattle's suburban areas. The Seattle City Council is considering a bill to remove the tax, but the beverage industry and other groups are opposed, arguing that the tax is regressive and creates a disincentive for healthy choices. The tax has also drawn criticism for targeting low-income communities and disrupting the local economy. The Seattle tax has generated revenue for the city, but it has also raised concerns about the potential for increased costs and reduced health benefits. The tax is seen as a means to encourage healthier behaviors and address obesity and diabetes, but critics argue that it is misguided and fails to address the root causes of these conditions. The tax has also been criticized for triggering confusion and generating unnecessary controversy, with some businesses claiming that the tax is a burden and others questioning the effectiveness of the tax in addressing public health issues. Overall, the Seattle tax on sweetened beverages has sparked a range of reactions from residents, businesses, and policymakers, highlighting the complexities of implementing taxes aimed at promoting healthier behaviors.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The Senate has the option to either pass a short-term spending bill for a week or a longer-term bill, but the government is likely to face a shutdown if the House passes the health care bill without significant changes to the ACA. The potential shutdown could have severe consequences for both the federal government and the American public, with millions of federal workers and contractors potentially losing access to essential services, including healthcare, education, and transportation. The shutdown could also harm the economy, particularly in the Washington region, where the federal government accounts for one-third of the country's GDP. The potential shutdown could also have a significant impact on the tourism industry, which is a major contributor to the region's economy. The shutdown could also result in a loss of revenue for local governments, as well as a disruption to the federal government's ability to provide basic services, such as mail service and food assistance. The potential shutdown could also have a ripple effect on the entire country, affecting the economy, as the federal government's presence accounts for one-third of the economy. The shutdown could also have a negative impact on the federal workforce, with many federal workers being furloughed and potentially losing income. The potential shutdown could also have a significant impact on the federal budget, with the federal payroll down 26,500 jobs in August and the federal government's contracting business down 5 billion dollars. The potential shutdown could also affect the safety net for vulnerable Americans, as the federal government could be forced to cut back on social security and other benefits.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The malware was able to bypass security measures and steal data without encryption, which made it difficult to trace the origin of the breach. The report from a computer firm hired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) detailed the types of software used in the attack, including memory scraping capabilities, and the region where the software was most prevalent. The report concluded that the breach was likely due to a combination of advanced software coding skills and a willingness to conduct covert operations.

The study involved monitoring the weight and body weight of 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over a median of five years, adjusting for various risk factors. The study found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78% increase in the risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% increase in the risk of heart attack, a 136% increase in the risk of stroke, and a 124% increase in the risk of death. The study emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy weight but highlights the negative effects of yo-yo dieting on cardiovascular health. The study suggests that individuals with pre-existing CAD who experience weight fluctuations may require a different approach to managing their weight, including lifestyle modifications and potentially addressing underlying health issues. The findings raise concerns about the long-term impacts of yo-yo dieting on individuals with CAD, highlighting the need for further research into the relationship between weight fluctuations and heart disease outcomes.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another. And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

However, the doctor informed Markham that Caleb was suffering from dehydration and required medical attention. Despite this, Markham refused to take Caleb to the hospital, stating that she wanted to follow a natural or vegan diet and believed that the soy-based formula was unsafe for her newborn. The pediatrician also reported that Caleb's weight loss was attributed to dehydration, and Markham was ordered to take Caleb to the hospital within an hour. However, Markham did not comply, and the pediatrician called her uncooperative and claimed that she was not concerned with Caleb's well-being. The judge ruled that Markham could not care for Caleb without a proper diagnosis and ordered her to obtain a nutritionist's report within ten days.

The study analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute's National Cancer Registry from 1998 to 2011 and found that 37,847 out of 258,000 colorectal cancer patients were younger than 50, with 15% of these patients being younger than 40. The study also found that younger patients were more likely to develop advanced-stage cancer, with 30% of patients diagnosed with regional or distant metastases, and 50% of patients diagnosed with localizations. The study recommends that primary care physicians consider younger patients for screening, especially those under 40, as this group is at a higher risk of developing advanced-stage cancer. The study also highlights the importance of identifying the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients, including changes in bowel symptoms, such as anemia, changes in bowel movements, and blood or blood mixed with stool, which may indicate the need for screening. The study notes that younger patients have a slightly longer survival rate without a cancer recurrence, but the incidence of early-stage cancer is increasing, suggesting the need for improved risk assessment and screening practices. The study concludes that the medical community should focus on identifying the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients, particularly those under 50, to improve cancer screening and reduce the number of deaths. The study emphasizes the need for further research to determine the causes of the increased incidence of young cancer and to identify risk factors for colon cancer, such as smoking, obesity, and physical activity. The study also notes that the current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening are based on the assumption that the majority of colorectal cancers are diagnosed in older men, but the actual incidence is increasing among younger patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The film's central antagonist, the commanding officer of the officers who killed the three men, is portrayed as a remorseful and apologetic individual, but he is ultimately responsible for the deaths of the victims. The film also touches on the systemic racism and the impact of the color of a person's skin on their treatment by law enforcement. The film's main characters are portrayed as flawed individuals who struggle with their own personal demons and the weight of their actions, and the film does not provide a complete understanding of the events. The film's central flaw is its inability to tell the story of the people involved, leaving the viewer with a sense of detachment and a desire for answers.

The author, astrophysicist and author of the paper, suggests that the three-step process is necessary to ensure that the universe remains stable and capable of providing energy to future civilizations. The author adds a new twist to the original model by proposing that the energy required to capture and extract energy from stars is the only way to prevent the universe from becoming completely isolated from the rest of the cosmos. The author argues that advanced civilizations would recognize the existence of such a structure through the intense radiation emitted by the stars, which peaks at longer wavelengths than normal. The article highlights the potential of massive stars and their proximity to the center of the universe, where the energy from these stars could be harnessed and used to propel the entire ball of energy back towards the planet that wants to use it. The article also mentions that the size of the sphere around the star would depend on the mass of the star, with a Type I civilization potentially able to harness the resources of a planet, while a Type II civilization could harness the energy of a star and a Type III civilization could harness the energy of all the stars in a galaxy.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

However, some Republicans, including Ron Paul, have accused Romney of attempting to manipulate the term to appeal to conservative voters.\nIn response to these allegations, Romney's campaign manager, Rick Santorum, stated that he had a long history of making statements that were not based on facts.

The Olorgesailie Basin was home to a series of sites that produced obsidian, a type of volcanic glass, which was likely used for hunting and processing food sources. The researchers also found evidence of pigment, which was likely derived from the region's natural resources and traded with other communities. The Olorgesailie Basin is the first to document the emergence of the Acheulian culture, which was characterized by the use of hand axes and the development of a diverse set of stone tools. The Middle Stone Age technology at Olorgesailie was well-established by the time of the emergence of Homo sapiens, with the Olorgesailie Basin providing evidence of the exchange of raw materials and knowledge between different groups.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The incident occurred in March 2014 when a wild panda wandered into the village of Liziba, where local officials were attempting to capture it. The animal bit the villager in the leg, causing significant injuries that required surgery. The victim sued the local forestry department and the nearby Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, claiming that the officials' negligence led to the injury. The forestry department and the local administration agreed to compensate the villager for the damages incurred, with the compensation amounting to 520,000 yuan. The incident highlights the challenges faced by wildlife conservation officials in protecting these endangered species, particularly in rural areas where they often face threats from human encroachment and habitat loss. The incident also underscores the importance of effective communication and coordination between government agencies and local communities in managing wildlife populations and ensuring public safety. Despite the compensation, the lawsuit may lead to further legal action against the forestry department and the nearby authorities if the plaintiff wishes to pursue additional compensation or seek legal remedies.

The National Security Minister, Peter Bunting, stated that the legislation does not intend to soften Jamaica's stance on drug trafficking or cultivate illegal pot plots. The Jamaican government expects the legislation to strengthen the country's position on international drug control and the legalization of medical marijuana.

The court has granted the chimpanzees' habeas corpus request, ordering the university to move them to a chimpanzee sanctuary in Florida. This decision marks a significant milestone in the fight for the legal recognition of chimpanzees as legal persons, allowing them to challenge their detention and potentially secure their release. The Nonhuman Rights Project hopes to influence other researchers and courts to follow suit, arguing that chimpanzees are capable of bodily autonomy and deserve the same protections as humans. The case highlights the importance of habeas corpus in protecting the rights of animals and underscores the need for the judiciary to strike down unconstitutional practices like the Military Commissions Act, which has been cited as a violation of habeas corpus for the past few decades. The case has sparked renewed interest in the legal status of chimpanzees and has raised questions about the criteria for determining whether animals qualify for habeas corpus. The Nonhuman Rights Project's efforts to establish chimpanzees as legal persons have gained momentum, with the Supreme Court's decision to hear the case in June 2022.

{"pred": "The United States government has announced plans to raid the Gibson Guitar Corporation in Tennessee, charging the company with trafficking in illegally obtained wood. The government claims that Gibson knowingly sourced illegally obtained wood from Madagascar, despite having previously purchased it from Brazil and India. The company maintains that it has provided documentation to support its compliance with the Lacey Act, which requires end users of endangered wood to verify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. The government has not yet confirmed whether Gibson has violated the Lacey Act, but a court motion filed in June asserts that Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband. The government is preparing to charge Gibson with trafficking in illegally obtained wood, alleging that the company knew about the risks involved and maintained a supply chain that was linked to illegal timber harvesting. The Gibson Guitar CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, defended the company's actions, stating that they were necessary to protect the company's reputation and prevent future illegal logging. However, some guitar industry representatives expressed concerns about the Lacey Act's retroactive nature and the potential for legal challenges in verifying compliance. The government has defended the law by emphasizing its intended purpose to reduce illegal logging and send a message to the market that consumers must source wood responsibly. The Lacey Act is a century-old law that requires end users of endangered wood to verify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees, and the government is preparing to charge the Gibson Guitar Corporation with trafficking in illegally obtained wood.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week. NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \"It's a nightmare,\" says a dealer. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 1352}

The ancient ocean covered a significant portion of the planet's surface, including the polar caps, and had a high D/H ratio compared to Earth's oceans. The study analyzed the Martian atmosphere's water vapor, revealing that the proportion of ordinary hydrogen has been slowly leaking into space, leading to a higher proportion of deuterium. The data suggests that Mars may have had a global ocean covering 137 meters deep, although it was likely not fully submerged. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the water content of Mars' ancient oceans, as it could potentially provide clues about the potential for life to exist on the planet. The discovery challenges the previous belief that Mars was a dry planet with a limited water supply, and supports the possibility of life on the Red Planet.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The case highlights the importance of protecting trademarks in the EU, particularly for multinational chocolate brands like Nestlé, as it faces competition from foreign firms. The ruling also affects the UK, where a lengthy court case over the shape of the Kit Kat candy bar was decided in 2016, leading to a 16,000-word ruling that Kit Kat's shape is not distinctive enough in every EU country. The case has also led to a debate in the UK, with some supporters arguing that the shape is unique and worth protecting, while others suggest that it is possible to create a similar shape without infringing on existing trademarks. The case has been ongoing, with Nestlé appealing the ruling multiple times, but the EUIPO will now consider additional evidence before making a final decision.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters. The brand name itself of \"KitKat\" is not being contested. (Atari accused Nestle of ripping off one of its popular video games in an ad for KitKat.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1828}
{"pred": "The study published in the Journal of Evolution reveals that dinosaurs did not roar like the sounds associated with the iconic film \"Jurassic Park.\" Instead, the sounds made by dinosaurs were generated by a sound studio, not the fossil record. The study analyzed the sounds made by various bird and crocodile species and found that the sounds of large-bodied birds, such as doves and ostriches, were not included in the sounds of dinosaurs. The study also found that the sounds of birds were influenced by the sounds of other animals, particularly the intelligent birds like the velociraptors in \"Jurassic Park\" and the gregarious birds like the baying ostrich. The study also highlights the evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds, which evolved independently at least 16 times in the lineage of Aves, a group of mammals that includes birds and crocodiles. The study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouthed vocalizations may have evolved in dinosaurs, although the exact nature of the sounds made by dinosaurs, such as the sounds of the T. rex, remain uncertain due to the lack of fossil evidence. The study also discusses the evolution of the sounds in birds and crocodiles, with the findings indicating that the sounds of birds are not always open, and the sounds of crocodiles are often described as snarls. The study concludes that the sounds of birds and crocodiles are not the only sounds that dinosaurs made, and the study suggests that the ability to mimic sounds may have played a role in dinosaur mating displays.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer program that uses brain activity patterns to reconstruct YouTube videos, demonstrating a previously unknown capability to perceive dynamic visual experiences. The study involved recording brain activity from participants during a series of YouTube videos, which were then processed using a machine learning algorithm to identify similarities between neural activity and the videos. The resulting reconstructed videos feature blurriness due to layers of overlapping content, with subtle changes in brain activity patterns predicting the content of the videos, including dream-like sequences, scenes, and even the viewer's intentions. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of neuroscience, offering insights into the inner workings of the human mind and potentially enabling the decoding of non-visional content, such as memories and intentions, in a court of law.

The bill, sponsored by Republican Representative Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), was introduced after months of discussions about the harmful effects of sequestration and the need for a balanced approach to reducing federal spending. The House has been in session for 20 days, with only two weeks of non-voting breaks, and the chamber has been productive, with the House passing a journal of proceedings bill, a sequester-related bill, and a resolution to rename the Dryden Flight Research Center to the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center. The bill also includes language to re-name the Dryden Flight Research Center to the Dryden Dryden Air Force Base, which is currently used for testing space missions. The bill is intended to provide a symbolic gesture of respect for the contributions made by former astronaut Neil Armstrong and the late engineer Hugh L. Dryden, who died in 1994.

In 2011, a team of statisticians in France used Bayes' theorem to analyze the data and determine the probability of the plane being found in a particular area. The team divided the search area into two components: one for the plane's flight path and another for the ocean currents. They used historical data from previous searches and simulated the effects of the ocean currents to predict the likelihood of the plane being found in the area. However, the team had to adjust the probability estimate based on the new information, which included the possibility of the plane being discovered further away from the wreckage site due to unpredictable ocean currents. The team then had to consider the likelihood of the plane being found in multiple points in the area, and the probability of the plane being found in the original search area was reduced. The team used Bayesian statistics to analyze the data and determine the most likely location of the plane wreckage. The team split the search area into a grid and calculated the probability of the plane being found in each region based on the likelihood of the plane being found in that area. The team used historical data to determine the likelihood of the plane being found in the areas where the plane had previously been searched, and they adjusted the probability estimate based on the new information. The team also considered the possibility of the plane being found in areas that had already been searched, but the probability of that happening was decreased. The team used a variety of statistical techniques, including Bayesian inference, to analyze the data and update the probability estimate. The team's approach involved considering the likelihood of the plane being found in different combinations of points in the search area, taking into account the uncertainty of the data and the potential for the plane to be found in areas that had already been searched. The team's approach allowed for the consideration of alternative explanations for the plane's disappearance, such as a deliberate act causing the crash, and the use of Bayesian statistics to refine the probability estimate. The team's findings suggest that the plane wreckage was located in a specific area, and the team's approach allowed for the consideration of alternative scenarios and the incorporation of new information to update the probability estimate.

Egeland had previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the insurance scam and for interstate failure to pay child support. The additional time in prison was imposed due to Egeland's guilty plea in May for his role in the mortgage fraud case, and he has since undergone three years and 10 months of incarceration. Egeland's son, Rylan, was found guilty of the crime and received a 20-gauge shotgun, while Egeland himself had his left leg amputated. The judge sentenced Egeland to three years and 10 months in prison, and he requested that he receive mental health treatment and counseling while in custody. Egeland's lawyer, Ryan O'Connor, argued that the psychological and emotional damage caused by the incident would haunt Egeland for the rest of his life. The judge granted the additional time, stating that the \"menace to society\" Egeland had caused would leave a lasting impact on the minor child. Despite the fraud being discovered, the Oregonian newspaper reported that Egeland had his 17-year-old son shoot him in the leg, leading to the amputation of his left leg.

The 188-country study found that there are 2.1 billion overweight or obese people in the world, making up around 30% of the world's population, up from 20% in 1980, USA Today reports. Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

The couple, who were found dead in their Toronto mansion, were believed to have committed suicide due to a ligature neck compression, a form of窒息 caused by a sharp object wrapped around the neck. The couple's deaths have raised concerns about the possibility of a murder-suicide, but the police have stated that the investigation remains inconclusive. The couple's families and friends have expressed shock and disbelief at the deaths, with some suggesting that the couple's deaths may be linked to their business careers and philanthropic efforts. The couple had four children and had recently welcomed a grandchild. They were known for their charitable work and had donated millions of dollars to hospitals, universities, and the United Jewish Foundation. The couple's net worth was estimated to be $4.77 billion, making them the 15th wealthiest person in Canada.

{"pred": "The Egyptian government has announced that it will begin the third phase of the country's parliamentary elections, which are taking place after the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak and the prosecution of his son Gamal Mubarak and his brother, Gamal. The final round of voting includes nine provinces, including the North and South Sinai, where the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party is leading the way. The elections are expected to highlight the control of the Brotherhood's grip on power and the influence of the military rulers, who have yet to reveal the formula for allocating seats among parties. The Brotherhood has stated that it aims to form a coalition government, but the military rulers have not yet spelled out the terms of a possible government. The prosecution argues that Mubarak was a \"tyrant\" who sought to install his son in his position, while the Brotherhood claims that it will form a coalition government to avoid the need for a coalition government. The Egyptian military has not yet revealed the formula for allocating seats among parties, and the Brotherhood's claim that it will form a coalition government remains unconfirmed. The final results of the election are expected to reflect the control of the Brotherhood's group, which has gained a significant majority of seats in the first two rounds of voting. The Brotherhood's efforts to ally itself with the liberals have raised concerns about the possibility of a difficult period of transition, and the military rulers' decision to retain the power to appoint the prime minister. The Brotherhood's chief, Mustafa Suleiman, has called for an end to humiliation and dignity for the former president and his sons, and the prosecution has emphasized the need for an end to the \"tyranny\" and the harshest penalty for Mubarak.

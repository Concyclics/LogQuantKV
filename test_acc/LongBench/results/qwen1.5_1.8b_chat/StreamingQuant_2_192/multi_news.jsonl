Kalashnikov was born in 1925 and grew up during the Soviet era, where the Red Army's lack of weapons led to a desire for a simple and effective solution. After receiving a letter from the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, which expressed concern about the potential moral responsibility for the deaths of civilians, Kalashnikov wrote a lengthy emotional letter to the church patriarch, claiming that he was deeply troubled by the loss of lives and felt a sense of guilt for the role his weapon played in the deaths of innocent people. The letter was published in Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin newspaper, and was signed by Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, who believed that a priest helped her father compose the letter. The letter highlights the complexity of Kalashnikov's thoughts and feelings towards the deaths of the victims, particularly those who were enemies of the Russian government. Kalashnikov's的设计初衷是为保卫国家，而不是为了保护敌人，这与俄罗斯政府的政策背道而驰。在去世后，他被普京总统接见，并出席了普京的葬礼，这进一步加强了俄罗斯教会和国家机构之间的紧密联系。Kalashnikov在信中表达了对设计这款武器的不满，称其为“恶魔般的欲望”、“内心的痛苦”，并认为自己有责任为这些死亡负责，即使他们并非敌人的敌人。尽管他的女儿说父亲是在教堂里写下了这封信，但据信，这封信是由一个信徒写的。Kalashnikov在信中写道：“我的精神痛苦难以忍受。我一直在寻找解决办法，如果我的枪支夺走了人们的生命，那么它是否应该为此负起责任，甚至那些人可能是他们的敌人？” Kalashnikov在接受《莫斯科邮报》采访时表示，他第一次在90岁时去教堂参加庆祝活动，后来又在91岁那年被洗礼。普京总统在去世前一个月因病入院，普京的新闻秘书Cyril Alexander Volkov在接受采访时表示，该教会在苏联解体后寻求加强与国家机构和权力官员的关系，这与普京的观点一致。 Kalashnikov在信中表达了他对AK-47的不满，称其为非武装分子使用时的完美武器，以及儿童士兵使用时的悲剧性。 Kalashnikov在信中写道", "answers": ["In our own obituary of AK-47 inventor Mikhail Kalashnikov last month, we included this quote: The rifle was invented \"for the protection of the Motherland,\" he said. \"I have no regrets and bear no responsibility for how politicians have used it.\" It turns out \"no regrets\" might not have exactly been true.

The auction of Kaczynski's hand-crafted items, such as a 35,000-word handwritten manifesto, has received bids ranging from $17,500 to $11,000, with the hoodie made famous by the artistic rendering in the FBI's \"Wanted\" poster being the most expensive item, fetching $20,025. Some argue that the auction is a reflection of the current state of society and the lack of collectible items related to the Unabomber's actions, while others see the hoodie and other items as having historical value.

The MNLA, which is aligned with the al-Qaeda-affiliated Ansar Dine, controls the northern part of Mali, including the cities of Timbuktu, Gao, and Kidal, and has taken control of the third largest town in the country, Gao. The rebels have demanded the independence of the Tuareg-speaking Tuareg部落, and the West African governments have responded with a diplomatic emergency committee that threatens to impose sanctions on the MNLA if it does not abandon its demands.

The film is set in an eerie gothic setting and follows the transformation of Lon Chaney Jr.'s portrayal of the original Talbot, with a focus on Benicio del Toro's performance as the transformed character. The film's visuals and special effects are criticized for being dated and unoriginal, with a campy feel, and the use of CGI. The film's attempt to merge the original's gothic style with modern horror tropes falls flat, and the film's characters lack depth and appeal. The film's director, Joe Johnston, is praised for his ability to create a suspenseful and gripping atmosphere, but the lack of a compelling lead and the use of a stereotypical \"wolf\" character limit the film's potential. The film's failure to attract a critical acclaim and the lack of memorable performances from the cast further contribute to its mediocrity. The film's director, Benicio del Toro, is a disappointment as he fails to bring a fresh twist to the original's gothic style, and his portrayal of a tortured and conflicted character lacks depth and empathy. The film's use of computer effects and a reliance on CGI instead of traditional makeup is criticized for making the movie look dated.

So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

{"pred": "Seattle's new $1.75-cent-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages has sparked controversy and debate among residents and businesses alike. The tax was implemented in January 2018 and aimed to encourage healthier choices, but it has led to a sharp increase in the price of soda and other sugary drinks, causing retailers like Costco to post signs indicating that customers can purchase drinks without paying the tax. The tax applies to beverages that list milk as their first ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages. The Seattle City Council is considering whether to extend the tax to exclude certain types of beverages, including those made with milk, which is currently exempt. The tax has also had negative impacts on local businesses, with many reporting decreased sales and customers leaving the city. The tax has generated a backlash from the beverage industry, with major companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo opposing the tax and arguing that it is counterproductive. The tax has also triggered legal challenges, with some municipalities facing criticism for implementing the tax despite widespread opposition. Despite the initial pushback, Seattle's tax on sweetened beverages has become a topic of discussion and concern for residents, with some advocating for alternative solutions to address the issue. The tax has raised concerns about the potential for increased revenue and reduced economic growth, as well as the potential for unintended consequences, such as increased congestion and decreased sales in local businesses. Overall, the Seattle tax on sweetened beverages has sparked a complex debate between residents, businesses, and policymakers, highlighting the importance of balancing public health goals with economic considerations.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The study analyzed data from the Danish National Birth Cohort Study, which tracked the health of over 64,000 children born between 1996 and 2002. The researchers found that women who took acetaminophen frequently during pregnancy were more likely to have a higher risk of a rare diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder, a type of ADHD, compared to those who did not take acetaminophen.

The House of Representatives has proposed a plan to delay the health law, which includes a one-year delay, and a repeal of the law's tax on medical devices. Senate Democrats have rejected the proposal, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto the bill if it passes. The Senate has agreed to a bill that would provide funding for the ACA, but it still faces opposition from House Republicans, who want to completely dismantle the law. The Senate is expected to vote on a short-term funding bill to avoid a government shutdown, but it is unclear if the bill will be enough to appease the Democrats and prevent a debt default. The potential shutdown could have significant consequences for the economy, including job losses, reduced access to federal services, and a decrease in tourism and travel. The shutdown could also have a negative impact on the federal government's budget and the national economy, particularly in the Washington region, where the federal government accounts for one-third of the economy. The House Speaker, John Boehner, is urging the House to pass a short-term funding bill to keep the government operating, but the Senate is likely to reject the proposal and push for a longer-term solution. The potential shutdown is expected to have a significant impact on the economy, with the potential for widespread service interruptions, a decline in tourism, and a loss of revenue for the federal government and its contractors.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says. Not everyone's convinced. \"I have seen many, many such claims in my career,\" a planetary scientist at Colorado's Southwest Research Institute tells Nature. \"And all of them have been wrong.\" (The Washington Post caught up with Brown for a Q&A on the latest Pluto-killing endeavor.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4933}

{"pred": "A new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine has found that individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD) who experience rapid weight fluctuations, also known as yo-yo dieting, have a significantly higher risk of heart attacks, stroke, and death compared to those with stable weight. The study involved monitoring the weight and body weight of 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over a median of five years, and adjusted for various risk factors. The study found that individuals with the highest weight variability had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death. The study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy weight but warns against the potential negative effects of yo-yo dieting, particularly for individuals with pre-existing CAD. The study emphasizes the need for individuals with CAD to maintain a stable weight and avoid weight fluctuations, as these fluctuations could lead to worse outcomes, including increased risk of heart attacks, stroke, and death. The study also notes the significance of weight fluctuations in relation to new-onset diabetes, suggesting that changes in body weight may contribute to the development of this condition. The study's findings raise concerns about the long-term health implications of yo-yo dieting for individuals with pre-existing CAD, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address the underlying causes of weight fluctuations and improve overall cardiovascular health. The study concludes that although its design does not definitively establish a causal relationship between yo-yo dieting and increased risk of CAD, it underscores the importance of considering the potential impact of weight fluctuations on heart health in this population. The study recommends further investigation into the mechanisms underlying weight fluctuations and the potential role of gut microbiota in contributing to these changes.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

The study highlights the importance of early detection and screening for younger patients, particularly those with advanced-stage cancer, as well as the need for improved risk assessment and screening guidelines. The study estimates that by 2030, one in four colorectal cancers in the US will be diagnosed in patients younger than 50, and the proportion of younger patients with advanced-stage cancer is expected to increase. The study also notes that younger patients tend to have more aggressive diseases, leading to better survival rates, but the yield of screening is lower due to the lack of risk factors for early detection. The study recommends that guidelines for screening be changed to start at a younger age, especially for younger patients with a family history of colorectal cancer, and that doctors consider the patient's family history and other risk factors when making recommendations. The study emphasizes the need for further research to determine the causes of the increased incidence of young colorectal cancer and to explore the impact of smoking, obesity, and physical activity on cancer development.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The film's portrayal of the victims' lives beyond the Algiers Motel is not explored, and the film's attempts to explain the events are limited. The film's central flaw is its inability to tell the story of the events without revealing the people, and the film's depiction of the police officers as outcasts and villains is not as nuanced as their previous works, such as \"Zero Dark Dark\" and \"The Hurt Locker.\" The film's rating of R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"violent violence and pervasive language\" is restricted, and the film's runtime of 143 minutes is rated R by the MPAA.

The author, astrophysicist and author of the paper, suggests that the three-step process is necessary to ensure that the universe remains stable and capable of providing energy to future civilizations. The author adds a new twist by proposing that the only way to avoid leaving the universe completely isolated is to capture and harvest stars from other galaxies using a massive array of satellites called \"Dyson spheres.\" The article highlights the importance of advanced civilizations understanding the inevitability of the universe expanding and the necessity of capturing and utilizing energy from other galaxies to maintain their ability to harness energy. The article also mentions that some scientists believe that advanced civilizations could exist thousands or even millions of years ago and have already started rearranging the stars, leading to the appearance of huge spherical structures called \"statite\" satellites that capture and store energy. The article concludes by discussing the challenges of detecting such structures in the light signature of a galaxy, and the potential for these structures to be discovered through astronomical observations.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "The Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya contains evidence of a significant shift in the development of early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. The Olorgesailie Basin was once a lush, grassland ecosystem, but over time, the landscape shifted to become a desert due to climate change. The Olorgesailie Basin is home to a variety of stone tools, including handaxes, which were shaped like tears and had rounded ends and a pointed end. The researchers believe that these tools were used for both foraging and hunting, and that the technology was well-established by 300,000 years ago. The team's findings challenge previous theories that modern humans emerged after a sudden transition to Middle Stone Age implements, suggesting instead that the technology may have been present for centuries before the emergence of modern humans. The Olorgesailie Basin provides evidence of a complex network of social interactions and technological advancements, including the exchange of raw materials and the use of pigments, which are thought to have been used symbolically or for practical purposes. The Olorgesailie Basin is the first location to document the emergence of complex social networks and the exchange of raw materials, providing insights into the early development of modern human societies. The Olorgesailie Basin's Middle Stone Age tools and pigment evidence suggest that early humans in the region developed a range of innovative behaviors and possibly traded with other groups, leading to the emergence of complex social networks and the development of modern human traits.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

The new system, which will be implemented in all United gates, will feature two lanes for boarding, with the first two lanes reserved for premium and elite passengers, while the remaining lanes will be for regular customers. Passengers will be called to board using a color-coded system, with the first two groups (Group 1 and 2) being called first, followed by Group 3, 4, and 5. The airline is encouraging passengers to wait until their boarding group is called, rather than standing in line, to avoid the need to stand in line with other passengers. The new boarding process is part of a larger agreement with United Airlines and its subsidiaries, including Copa Airlines and other airlines, for a joint business agreement that is expected to benefit both airlines and their customers. The agreement is expected to lead to increased competition and growth for customers, as well as improved value and service.

{"pred": "The article reports on a groundbreaking medical procedure performed at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital to create a pair of ears for a nine-year-old boy named Kieran Sorkin, who was born without ears due to a rare condition called microtia. The procedure involved removing the rib cartilage from both sides of Kieran's body and shaping it into a framework for his ears. The surgeons used a template of Kieran's mother's ears as a guide, ensuring that the ear shapes closely resemble her own. The ear frameworks were then inserted into pockets in Kieran's skin, and the skin was manipulated to form the ear shapes on both sides. The surgery was considered a cosmetic procedure, aimed at improving Kieran's confidence and self-esteem, rather than enhancing his hearing. The procedure involves harvesting the rib cartilage from the patient's own body and using it to create a new ear. The technique is based on the assumption that Kieran's mother's ears would provide a good starting point for the ear reconstruction process.

The procedure is expected to produce a high-quality ear that will give Kieran confidence and self-esteem, helping him to feel accepted by others and perform better in school. The procedure is currently being researched and developed by experts at the Institute of Child Health, part of the University College London, who aim to create a human-like ear from stem cells sourced from the patient's own fat tissue. The researchers believe that this approach would be less invasive than harvesting a child's rib cartilage, making the procedure accessible to a wider range of patients. The procedure is expected to be completed within the next decade, and the researchers are optimistic that it could revolutionize the way human ears are reconstructed.

Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

The company claims that it sources its wood from legal suppliers, including Gibson's own subsidiary, C.F. Martin Guitar Co., who maintains that all of their imports comply with U.S. and Malagasy law. The government argues that Gibson's wood comes from illegal sources, specifically from Madagascar, and that the company has failed to provide evidence of its compliance. The government has filed a lawsuit against Gibson and the company, alleging that they have violated the Lacey Act, a century-old law that prohibits the export of endangered wood. The government has accused Gibson of knowingly importing illegally sourced wood from Madagascar, which was previously banned due to over-harvesting. The Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to verify the legality of their supply chain, and Gibson has stated that it did not obtain any government stamp or certification for its wood from Madagascar. The government has also claimed that Gibson has maintained a supply chain that has been linked to illegal logging, and that the company has not provided sufficient documentation to support its claims. The case has raised concerns about the effectiveness of the Lacey Act in reducing illegal logging and sending a message to the market that wood must be sourced responsibly. The government has argued that the Lacey Act is necessary to protect endangered forests and prevent the illegal logging industry from continuing. The case has sparked discussions about the role of the Lacey Act in regulating the illegal logging industry and the need for increased transparency and accountability in the wood supply chain.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

{"pred": "The study published in the journal Science reveals that Mars had a substantial ocean covering a significant portion of its surface four billion years ago, with a high concentration of deuterium compared to Earth's ocean. The ocean contained both ordinary hydrogen and heavy deuterium, with the former being lost to space over time due to the planet's thinner atmosphere. The study analyzed the Martian atmosphere's water vapor, revealing that the abundance of heavy deuterium was seven times greater than Earth's ocean. The data suggests that Mars may have had a global ocean covering the entire planet, with a depth of at least 450 feet (137 meters), although the actual extent of the ocean is likely limited by the Martian terrain. The study also highlights the importance of the Martian water vapor, which is believed to have been present on Mars during the ancient era, providing evidence for the existence of life on the planet. The study further supports the idea that Mars was once much wetter and warmer than it is today, with the presence of a large ocean covering a significant fraction of the planet's surface. The findings have implications for the possibility of life on Mars, as the ocean could potentially harbor life-forming microorganisms. The study's results are supported by the recent detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere, suggesting the presence of life on the planet. However, the authors note that the true amount of water on Mars is likely much larger than currently estimated, and the evidence for life on Mars is still inconclusive.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer program that uses brain activity patterns to reconstruct YouTube videos, a previously unattainable task due to the complexity of visual perception. The study involved recording brain activity from participants during a series of YouTube videos, which were then processed using a machine learning algorithm to identify similarities between neural activity and the videos. The resulting reconstructed videos feature subtle changes in brain activity patterns that correspond to the content of the videos, including the movement of characters, landscapes, and other visual elements. The researchers believe that this technology has the potential to provide insights into the inner workings of the human mind, potentially offering a glimpse into dreams, memories, and even intentions. However, the technology's limitations lie in the fact that it relies on brain activity patterns that are only a fraction of the complex visual processing that occurs in the brain. The researchers suggest that the technology could be used to broadcast visual information, such as sequences of actions or facial expressions, in court cases, but the accuracy of such readings would depend on the nature of the visual information itself, as well as the limitations of the technology. Overall, the development of this technology represents a significant advancement in the field of neuroscience, providing a new tool for understanding and interpreting human visual experiences.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

In 2011, a team of statisticians in France used Bayes' theorem to analyze the data and determine the probability of the plane's location. The team divided the search area into two regions, one for the initial search and another for the potential search area. They calculated the probability of the plane being found in each region based on historical data and the likelihood of the black box and cockpit voice recorder being found in the area. The team then adjusted the probability based on the possibility of the black box being damaged and the likelihood of the plane being found in a different area. The team used the information to create a probability map, which allowed them to narrow down the search area to a specific latitude-longitude combination. The team then simulated the search for the plane, considering various scenarios, including the possibility of a deliberate act causing the disappearance, and updated the probability accordingly. The team used the information gathered during the search to refine the probability estimates and eventually identified the plane wreckage in June 2009, leading to the discovery of the black box and cockpit voice recorder.

{"pred": "The world is facing a significant public health crisis related to obesity, with nearly 2.1 billion people living with obesity, accounting for 13% of the global population. The study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington's Seattle-based research center, provides the most comprehensive overview of obesity trends worldwide over the past 30 years. The report shows that obesity rates have risen across all continents, with the highest rates occurring in the Middle East and North Africa, followed by Asia, where obesity rates are particularly high. In the United States, obesity rates have increased significantly, with 13% of the population being obese, while the remaining 87% are either overweight or obese. The study also highlights the impact of obesity on various health risks, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study found that obesity rates are increasing in both developed and developing countries, with no country achieving a complete reduction in obesity rates. The study suggests that obesity is a major risk factor for several health issues, including increased calorie intake, changes in diet composition, decreased physical activity, and the rise of sedentary lifestyles. The study also identifies the role of affordable access to unhealthy foods and the rise in the availability of these foods in urban areas, which contribute to the problem of obesity. The study concludes that obesity is a global public health crisis that affects people of all ages, regions, and income levels, highlighting the need for urgent action to address the issue. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study the rising obesity rates among children worldwide and propose solutions, with a goal of releasing a report in early 2015. The study emphasizes the importance of addressing obesity as a major risk factor for chronic diseases and mortality, with nearly two-thirds of the obese population residing in developing countries. The study also finds that obesity rates are increasing in young populations, with more than half of the world's obese individuals living in just 10 countries: the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The study highlights the need for a coordinated effort to combat obesity, with the majority of the world's obesity cases concentrated in wealthy countries like the United States, where obesity rates have increased significantly in the past few decades. The World Health Organization aims to publish a report on the rising obesity rates among children worldwide by early 2015, providing insights into the factors contributing to the problem", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

According to a report by UK magazine Look, Cruise has reportedly written the letter as a way to rekindle their friendship, despite the fact that they were previously estranged. The letter, which was sent in May 2021, was reportedly written in response to her filing legal papers to end the marriage in June 2020. The letter was said to be a heartfelt gesture from Cruise, who had been dating Holmes for 12 years before their separation. The letters were added to the Wayback Machine by the Internet Archive, which began collecting data from the web in 1996, and are now being added daily to the website. The flow of data from the Wayback Machine allows the archive to preserve the history of websites and their content, making it possible to access past versions of websites even after an embargo period. The move by the Internet Archive to add the data to the Wayback Machine is significant because it provides a valuable resource for researchers, historians, and anyone interested in studying the evolution of the internet and its impact on society. The addition of the data to the Wayback Machine is part of a larger effort by the Internet Archive to preserve and make accessible historical information from the internet, which is crucial for understanding the development of the internet and its role in shaping our world today.", "answers": ["It's been a year since Katie Holmes filed for divorce from Tom Cruise, and apparently Cruise is feeling sentimental.

{"pred": "The Egyptian government has announced that the third phase of the country's parliamentary elections will focus on delivering a clear majority to the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, which has emerged as the leading candidate. The Brotherhood, which has been the dominant political force in Egypt since the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak, is expected to secure a majority of seats in the full Parliament, potentially giving it a significant advantage over the ruling military and other parties. The Brotherhood's campaign has emphasized its commitment to democracy and human rights, while the military rulers have yet to specify the formula for allocating seats among parties based on their share of the vote. The final results of the vote are expected to highlight the influence of the Brotherhood in the Egyptian political landscape and the challenges it faces in forming a government. The prosecution of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and his son Gamal Mubarak is ongoing, with the former president facing charges of corruption and conspiracy to kill protesters. The Brotherhood's allies, including the Free Egyptians and the socialists, are also expected to gain seats in the new government. The outcome of the elections will determine the fate of Egypt's military rulers, who have vowed to retain their power until the presidential elections are held in June. The Brotherhood's stance on the issue of the election process and the possibility of a coalition government remains a topic of concern, as the group seeks to avoid a repeat of the 18 days of protests that brought down Mubarak in 2011. The Brotherhood's efforts to align itself with the moderate forces and the military rulers' desire to maintain stability in the aftermath of the revolution are expected to play a role in shaping the political landscape in Egypt. The outcome of the elections is expected to have implications for the country's economic growth, political stability, and the balance of power between the military and the Brotherhood.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house.

A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party.

{"pred": "The professor believes that the back-end recognizer for the Aurora task needs to be improved by focusing on reducing the number of states for the short-term models, as the number of states is likely to be a factor limiting the overall performance of the system. To achieve this, the professor suggests using a simpler model with fewer states, possibly with a reduced number of Gaussians, and a reduced number of states in the final model. Additionally, the professor mentions that the final model should have a single Gaussian for each state, which is a simplified version of the HMM model. The professor also mentions that the model should be trained on a smaller dataset, which could potentially lead to a more efficient and compact model. The professor suggests that the model should be optimized for a specific application, such as a small dataset, and that the model's performance might be affected by the size of the training data.\nIn summary, the professor believes that the goal of improving the Aurora task is to reduce the number of states and increase the model complexity, aiming for a simpler architecture with fewer states and a reduced number of Gaussians.

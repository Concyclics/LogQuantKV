On Monday, the LAPD declared an unlawful assembly on the streets surrounding City Hall and ordered the protesters to disperse or face arrest. However, the protesters remained in the park, despite the police's orders. The Los Angeles encampment, which has grown to approximately 400 tents and 700 to 800 people, organizers and municipal officials said, is among the largest on the West Coast aligned with a 2-month-old national Occupy Wall Street movement protesting economic inequality and excesses of the U.S. financial system.

{"pred": "The article discusses the life and legacy of Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the iconic AK-47 assault rifle. Kalashnikov, born in 1925 in Russia, developed the rifle during World War II, which saw the Red Army's severe shortage of weapons. After the war, Kalashnikov became disillusioned with the Soviet government's policies and began working on a more efficient and effective military solution. He eventually founded the Kalashnikov Design Bureau, where he worked on developing the AK-47, a versatile and adaptable firearm that revolutionized the battlefield.\n\nKalashnikov's letter to the Russian Orthodox Church, dated May 2012, expresses his deep regret and moral responsibility for the deaths of millions of people due to the AK-47's widespread use. In the letter, Kalashnikov writes that he feels a sense of guilt for the lives lost because of his creation, even though he was a Christian and an Orthodox believer. He explains that his spiritual pain is unbearable, and he continues to ponder the question of whether he should be held accountable for the deaths of innocent civilians.\n\nThe letter is handwritten on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper and is signed with a wavering hand. It is reproduced by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, and contains detailed information about Kalashnikov's background, his involvement in the development of the AK-47, and his thoughts on the morality of his invention. The letter also mentions Kalashnikov's baptism and his attendance at various events celebrating his 90th birthday.\n\nThe article highlights Kalashnikov's contributions to the development of the AK-47, including its durability, versatility, and effectiveness in combat situations. The rifle quickly gained popularity among armed groups and became a symbol of resistance against Soviet rule. Despite his reputation as a military genius, Kalashnikov's actions were often criticized for their brutal and indiscriminate nature, particularly in the context of the conflict in Afghanistan.\n\nThe article also touches on Kalashnikov's relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church, which played a significant role in his decision to create the AK-47. Kalashnikov initially rejected responsibility for the deaths of the people it killed, citing his Christian beliefs and the need for a more just and ethical approach to warfare. However, his letter to the Patriarch Kirill, which was published in Izvestia, suggests that he may have expressed a degree of guilt or remorse for his actions", "answers": ["In our own obituary of AK-47 inventor Mikhail Kalashnikov last month, we included this quote: The rifle was invented \"for the protection of the Motherland,\" he said. \"I have no regrets and bear no responsibility for how politicians have used it.\" It turns out \"no regrets\" might not have exactly been true. The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

The hearing was presided over by Judge William P. Brady, who found that McCullough was wrongly convicted due to \"clear and convincing evidence\" that he was not present at the scene of the crime.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events.

Since January 1, 2016, the CDC has confirmed 50 cases of AFM in 24 states, compared to just 21 cases in 2015. The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to viral infections, such as enteroviruses, which are common and can cause mild illnesses in children. When enteroviruses enter the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain, leading to paralysis. The symptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The best way to prevent AFM is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM. The incidence of AFM has increased significantly since 2014, coinciding with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68. The CDC has issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing. As of November 13, 2014, 88 cases had been reported in 32 states, with a median age of 7.6 years and 54% of cases being males. The median duration of illness was 25 days, and 65% of cases had cranial nerve motor dysfunction. Six (7%) patients had altered mental status, and three (3%) had seizures.

{"pred": "The Shroud of Turin, a centuries-old artifact believed to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, has been subjected to a new forensic investigation by researchers who claim it contains inconsistencies in its bloodstain pattern. The shroud, which is currently displayed in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, has been radiocarbon dated to between 1260 and 1390 CE, making it a likely candidate for the crucifixion of Jesus. The researchers, led by Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, used real and synthetic blood samples to analyze the bloodstains on the left-hand side of the cloth, comparing them to the images of a standing model versus a crucified man or a face-down corpse. The results showed that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any single pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprints the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The investigators also tested the flow of blood on the left-hand side of the cloth, finding that the trickles from the hand and the flow along the arm occurred at two completely different angles, further supporting the idea that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse, adding to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The investigation has sparked renewed interest in the shroud's authenticity, with some experts questioning the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating and the reliability of the bloodstain pattern analysis. The findings of the forensic investigation have been published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, raising questions about the true nature of the shroud and the possibility of alternative explanations for its bloodstains.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Rapp claims that Spacey touched him inappropriately and made advances towards him in a party at Spacey's New York apartment in 1986. Spacey denied the allegations and apologized for his behavior, stating that he didn't remember the encounter but acknowledged that he was a sexual predator. The second article focuses on the accusers themselves, including five men who say they were teenagers at the time and were sexually harassed, assaulted, or attempted to rape by Spacey. These men include Roberto Cavazos, Daniel Beal, Justin Dawes, Mark Ebenhoch, and Harry Dreyfuss. They describe incidents that occurred between 1986 and 2010, including Spacey's sexual advances towards them, his attempts to sexually assault them, and his inappropriate behavior towards others on the set. The third article reports on the ongoing legal battle between Kevin Spacey and Netflix, which announced that the final season of the popular TV series \"House of Cards\" would be without the actor. The fourth article discusses the latest allegations against Spacey, which involve a new accuser, Josh King, who claims that Spacey grabbed his son's genitals in 2016. King's son filed a police report and provided evidence to the Nantucket Police Department, leading to an investigation by the police. The article also mentions that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in favor of the accuser, ordering the removal of Spacey from the film \"All the Money in the World\" and replacing him with Christopher Plummer.

The skeleton was found lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace, making it a \"wonderful discovery\" for archaeologists. The team from the University of Reading made the find while excavating Wilsford henge in the Vale of Pewsey. The body was estimated to be around 1.5 meters in length and wearing an amber necklace, providing insight into the gender of the child, diet, pathologies, and date of burial. The discovery is significant because it adds to the knowledge of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge, helping to identify sites for protection and improved management, as well as adding a new dimension to our understanding of this important archaeological environment. The Vale of Pewsey dig, led by the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum, aims to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge, including the Marden henge and Wilsford henge, which are both located in the Vale of Pewsey.

The feathers were well-preserved on a nearly complete skeleton, revealing intricate structures such as platelet-like nanostructures and the presence of melanosomes within the feathers. The researchers analyzed the feathers using a combination of scanning electron microscopy and discriminant function analysis, identifying the iridescent colors as blue, pink, and purple.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

They descended the mountain's west face using Mr Wilson's phone, crossing the unstable rocks and steep inclines. However, Mrs. Wilson fell 30 feet (9 meters) down a vertical cliff, resulting in severe injuries. The coroner concluded that Mrs. Wilson's accidental death was due to the change in route, which was an attempt to traverse the west face to avoid the summit. The couple had been mountain walking and scrambling for six years, and their decision to rely solely on a smartphone app without proper first aid knowledge left them vulnerable to the risks associated with the rugged terrain.

{"pred": "Seattle's new sugary drink tax, which was introduced in 2018, has had a significant impact on the city's economy and residents' purchasing habits. The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold, making it more expensive for consumers. The tax applies to soda, sports drinks, kombucha, and other sugary beverages that don't list milk as their first ingredient. The tax has led to a decrease in sales of these products, especially in large quantities, and retailers like Costco have responded by redirecting customers to locations outside city limits where they can purchase the product without paying the massive tax. The tax has also impacted local businesses, with some experiencing reduced sales and increased competition from nearby stores. The tax has been controversial, with some arguing that it disproportionately affects low-income families and discriminates against certain groups. The tax has also triggered numerous lawsuits, including those challenging the validity of the tax and its application to food stamp purchases. Despite the negative impacts, the tax has been seen as a necessary measure to address the issue of obesity and diabetes, which contribute to health problems and higher healthcare costs. However, the tax has also faced criticism for its lack of consistency and its potential to drive out sales of healthier alternatives. The tax has been proposed to be extended to other jurisdictions in the US, but the outcome remains uncertain. Overall, the Seattle soda tax has had a mixed impact on the city's economy and residents, highlighting the importance of balancing economic growth with public health concerns.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

However, Senate Democrats have rejected any changes to the health law, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any bill that includes the repeal. The Senate is scheduled to reconvene on Monday afternoon, but the impasse is likely to persist until the deadline. The potential shutdown could have significant economic impacts, including job losses, reduced access to healthcare, and decreased tourism. Local economists predict that 60% of federal workers would be deemed \"nonessential\" and would stay home, resulting in lost income tax revenue from tens of thousands of idled federal workers.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The Parker Solar Probe, named after Parker, will be launched in July 2018 and aim to study the sun's outer atmosphere, particularly the corona, which is the region where the sun's magnetic field interacts with the Earth's magnetic field. The spacecraft will travel to within four million miles of the sun's surface, which is currently the furthest any spacecraft has ever gone to the sun. The Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with a heat shield made of advanced carbon-composite material, which will protect the spacecraft from the extreme temperatures and radiation it will encounter during its journey. The spacecraft will conduct a series of flybys of Venus, which will allow it to observe the solar wind and gain a better understanding of the sun's behavior. The Parker Solar Probe will also study the solar wind's acceleration and the mechanisms that generate it, including the interaction with the Earth's magnetic field. The mission aims to unravel the mysteries of the sun's outer atmosphere and its relationship with the solar wind, which is a key component of the solar cycle. The Parker Solar Probe will also investigate the origins of the solar wind, including the heating of the sun's corona and the acceleration of charged particles. The spacecraft will collect data on the solar wind's properties, including its composition, velocity, and acceleration, and study the interactions between the sun and the Earth's magnetic field. The mission will also examine the solar wind's impact on the Earth's ionosphere, which is the region where the sun's magnetic field interacts with the Earth's magnetic field.

This allowed the attackers to steal credit and debit card data without the need for physical access to the stores. The attack was carried out by criminal groups in Eastern Europe, using software coding proficiency to orchestrate the various components of the activity. The report from iSight, a computer firm hired to investigate the breach, detailed the type of software used, the effectiveness of the attack, and the regions where software capabilities exist to create the malware.

The Kenya Wildlife Service initially stated that the lion had escaped from the Nairobi National Park due to noise and commotion from bystanders, but the agency later confirmed that the lion had been surrounded by a group of men who took pictures and threw rocks at it. The rangers then used tranquilizers to kill the lion before veterinarians arrived with them. The incident highlights the delicate balance between protecting people and conserving wildlife, particularly in countries like Kenya where the population of lions has declined significantly due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflicts with livestock herders. The authorities are currently investigating the cause of the lion's escape and are considering various options, including relocating the lion to a different park or capturing it and transporting it to a sanctuary. The incident also raises concerns about the impact of infrastructure projects on wildlife populations, with some residents in Nairobi complaining about the destruction of electric fences and the disruption of lion movements.

The planet, estimated to be between five and ten times the mass of Earth, orbits beyond Neptune's path and is located at a distance of billions of miles. The discovery was made using mathematical and computer modeling, and the two researchers, Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, predict that it will be detected within the next five years. The IAU, the international organization responsible for defining planets, has already ruled that Planet Nine does not meet the criteria for a planet, including the requirement for a \"clear neighborhood\" around its orbit. However, the researchers argue that Planet Nine's gravitational influence on nearby objects could potentially alter their orbits, leading to periodic changes in their paths. The discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed interest in the search for exoplanets, with some experts suggesting that it could provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the solar system. Despite the controversy surrounding Pluto's demotion, Professor Mike Brown remains optimistic about the future of the solar system, stating that the discovery of Planet Nine will help educate people about the diversity of celestial objects in the universe and the complex dynamics of the solar system. The discovery of Planet Nine marks a significant milestone in the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life, and it is expected to have a profound impact on our understanding of the solar system and the nature of the universe.", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology say a giant celestial body \"lurking at the end of our solar system,\" as the Washington Post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \"Planet Nine.\" In their research published in the Astronomical Journal, the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in getting Pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as Earth, and per the AP, almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The study involved 9,509 men and women with stable CAD, monitoring their weight over an average of 12 visits. The median body weight variation over the period was 3.8 pounds per visit, and the researchers adjusted for various risk factors before comparing the weight variability of the two groups: those with the lowest weight variability (one-fifth) and those with the highest.\n\nThe study found that individuals with the highest weight variability had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability. The researchers attributed this difference to the fact that the highest weight variability group experienced larger fluctuations in body weight over the study period, leading to a greater likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular events.\n\nYo-yo dieting, characterized by repeated cycles of weight loss and gain, has been previously associated with poor heart health. However, the new study adds to this evidence by showing that individuals with CAD who experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than those who experienced little change in body weight. The study's findings highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy weight in individuals with CAD, particularly those who have pre-existing heart disease.\n\nTo prevent and manage CAD, the study recommends adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise, a balanced diet, and appropriate medication management. The researchers emphasize the role of gut microbiota in triggering weight fluctuations in individuals with CAD, suggesting that changes in gut bacteria could play a crucial role in the development of obesity and its associated cardiovascular risks.\n\nThe study's findings raise concerns about the potential long-term effects of yo-yo dieting on individuals with CAD, highlighting the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms linking weight fluctuations to increased risk of heart disease. The study's limitations include the inability to pinpoint the precise reasons behind weight fluctuations and the lack of information on the specific triggers for these fluctuations in individuals with CAD.\n\nIn conclusion, the new study highlights the significant health implications of yo-yo dieting for individuals with CAD, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach to managing this condition.

The DJs, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, who were pretending to be Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles, made the call to the hospital in London on May 10, 2012, during which they obtained information about the condition of Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, who was being treated for acute morning sickness. The call was later played on air, causing shock and outrage worldwide. The hospital subsequently confirmed Saldanha's death, and the radio network has since suspended all prank calls, cancelled the show Greig and Christian presented, Hot 30, and suspended all 2Day FM advertising until further notice. The network's CEO, Rhys Holleran, expressed deep regret for the death of the nurse and stated that the company would conduct a thorough review of its policies and procedures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has not commented on the specific regulations or laws that were violated, but it has ordered a comprehensive review of the radio station's practices. The death of Saldanha has sparked demands for stricter regulation of the electronic media, with some calling for a wider investigation beyond the usual process of giving broadcasters 60 days to respond to complaints. The radio network's decision to suspend all prank calls has led to criticism from the public and media outlets, with some accusing the DJs of having blood on their hands due to the prank's timing and impact on the hospital's reputation. The death of Saldanha has also raised concerns about the role of the media in shaping public opinion and influencing public perception of healthcare professionals.

This is a significant shift from the traditional view that colorectal cancer is primarily associated with older men. The study estimates that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively. According to the study, younger patients tend to have more aggressive treatments, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, compared to older patients. The study also found that younger patients with tumors that have metastasized, or reached other organs, were more likely to get more aggressive treatments. The study lacks data on family history and other risk factors for colorectal cancers, and it's unclear whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths. The study recommends that doctors should be on the lookout for warning signs of colon cancer, such as bright red bleeding with a bowel movement, and that people with a family history of colon cancer and others at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The oldest known artefact found in Australia is a tiny axe fragment dated to 44,000 years ago, but radiocarbon dating of burnt eggshells reveals them to be between 45,000 and 49,000 years old.

The fraternity, based in Indianapolis, has retained legal counsel and is planning to sue the men. The full statement released by Zeta Beta Tau reads as follows:\n\nZeta Beta Tau Fraternity has no affiliation with the rogue group that illegally used the Zeta Beta Tau name at the University of Albany and is involved in the alleged hazing that resulted in the death of a University of Albany student. The group is not the Epsilon Gamma Chapter of Zeta Beta Tau, which is recognized by the Fraternity and the University as a leader on campus. Rather, these men are a separate rogue group not authorized to use the Zeta Beta Tau name. The men allegedly involved in this incident are not, nor have ever been, members of Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity. This group allegedly involved in the incident is not recognized by the University nor Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity.

{"pred": "The three-step process for dominating the universe involves harvesting all of a planet's resources, all of a nearby star's energy, and all the energy from all the stars in a local galaxy. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev first proposed these three phases of galactic expansion in 1962 as a way to measure the energy consumption of increasingly powerful societies. A recent paper posted on the preprint journal arXiv.org has revived Kardashev's model and added a new, apocalyptic twist, suggesting that any sufficiently advanced civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will expand throughout the universe, attempting to secure as many stars as possible before they become permanently inaccessible due to the encroaching horizon caused by dark energy. To capture stars from other galaxies, scientists propose using a swarm of satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" which would create a spherical shell around a star and harness its energy. The satellites would be made of satellites, such as solar-powered ones, and would be capable of maintaining their position in space through gravitational balance. The satellites would not be in orbit, but instead hover in space, forming a \"statite\" ring around the star. The satellite would collect the star's energy and beam it back to the home planet, where it could be harnessed for various purposes, including powering spacecraft and generating electricity. The paper suggests that this approach could potentially lead to the discovery of advanced alien civilizations, which could be of three types: a Type I civilization that harnesses all the resources of a planet, a Type II civilization that harnesses all the radiation of a star, and a Type III civilization that harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. The paper proposes that a solid shell around a star would be gravitationally unstable and would require more material than all of the planets of a solar system could provide, making practical Dyson spheres a feasible solution. The top 10 mad scientists, most famous astronomers of all time, and top 10 star trek technologies are mentioned in the article, highlighting the potential applications of these concepts in the search for advanced alien civilizations.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The show was initially launched in 1996 as a satire of mainstream news programs, featuring humorous headlines and interviews with guests. The show's format was unique, with a focus on skewering the news and offering commentary on current events. The first episode of The Daily Show aired on July 22, 1996, and quickly gained popularity, particularly among younger male viewers. The show's success led to airing a test show in November 1996, which allowed Stewart to gain a foothold in the late-night comedy landscape.\n\nIn the early years of The Daily Show, the show's writers and producers focused on creating a fresh perspective on news by incorporating elements of satire and humor. However, as the show evolved, Stewart and his team began to push boundaries and challenge traditional news formats. One significant shift occurred in 1998, when Stewart was offered the hosting position on The Daily Show, replacing Craig Kilborn. Despite initial skepticism from the writers and producers, Stewart's commitment to the show's point of view and his willingness to take risks paid off, leading to a period of intense competition for the title of \"best\" news show.\n\nDuring this time, The Daily Show underwent several changes, including the addition of new correspondents and contributors, such as Vance DeGeneres and David Jaegerbaum. The show's lineup shifted towards a more diverse cast, with a mix of established and emerging talents, reflecting the evolving landscape of late-night comedy. The introduction of a new correspondent, Steve Carell, further solidified the show's comedic identity, as he brought a fresh perspective and a comedic edge to the field pieces.\n\nAs The Daily Show continued to evolve, Stewart and his team faced challenges, including conflicts with existing writers and the perception of the show as a niche comedy compared to other late-night networks. In 2000, a controversy surrounding a field piece featuring a man who replaced his own teeth with driveway gravel led to a lawsuit, highlighting the show's sensitivity to sensitive topics and the need to balance humor with accuracy.\n\nDespite these challenges, The Daily Show maintained a loyal fan base and continued to grow in popularity. In 2003, Stewart's first guest, Steve Carell, joined the show, bringing a fresh perspective and a comedic sensibility to the field pieces.

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show.

Santorum also mentioned that he did not believe there was any issue with the way his supporters at CPAC turned out, emphasizing that he did not try to rig the polls. However, his campaign rejected Santorum's statement, claiming that he had a history of making statements that were not grounded in the truth.\nIn Passage 2, Ron Paul expressed confusion about Romney's description of himself as a severe conservative, stating that he shared his interest in this concept but did not understand its exact meaning. Paul also acknowledged that Romney's Friday \"accommodation\" was as far as he would go to win over the bishops, which involved allowing insurance companies to cover contraception costs from church-run schools and hospitals. Paul stated that health insurers would actually pay less for the birth control-inclusive plans due to reduced pregnancies, which he attributed to the reduction in pregnancies.\nIn Passage 3, White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew confirmed President Obama's consistent position on birth control and Catholic institutions, stating that his Friday \"accommodation\" was as far as he would go to win over the bishops.

{"pred": "The discovery of ancient Middle Stone Age tools in Kenya, dating back to around 320,000 years ago, provides new insights into the development of early human societies in the region. The oldest tools, consisting mainly of hand axes, were shaped like tear drops with rounded ends and pointed eyes, indicating a focus on cutting and processing plant material. The next technological revolution, marked by the emergence of Middle Stone Age implements, occurred tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought, suggesting that early humans began developing it even earlier than previously thought. The team of international scientists found that the Middle Stone Age tools were made from obsidian that originated far from Olorgesailie Basin, while the pigment lumps, including two pieces with grinding marks, were from an undetermined distance outside the Olorgesailie vicinity. The team's findings challenge the traditional view that modernity arose outside of Africa and provide evidence of the early development of complex behaviors and communication in early human societies. The Middle Stone Age tools and pigment lumps suggest that early humans were adapting to changing environments, engaging in trade, and forming social networks, which laid the foundation for the emergence of modern human cognition and language. The discovery challenges the notion that modern human behaviors emerged solely due to cultural and artistic innovations, and highlights the importance of understanding the context and history of early human societies in Africa.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

On Saturday, Trump tweeted that his social media use is \"modern-day presidential,\" less than an hour after accusing the media of trying to convince lawmakers that he should stop using Twitter. The tweet came after Trump attacked \"Morning Joe\" co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, and some Republicans expressed concerns about his habit of tweeting incendiary content.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump said he didn't want to act presidential \"quite yet,\" but promised that he would become \"so presidential that you people will be so bored, and I will come back as a presidential person.\" However, his tweets have been met with criticism, with some Republicans expressing concern about his behavior and suggesting that he may be crossing the line into inciting violence.\n\nIn addition to his political tweets, Trump has also faced criticism for his personal conduct, including his treatment of staff members, his relationship with the press, and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In December, he was criticized for his response to the virus, which some argued was slow and inadequate, and for his decision to hold large gatherings without wearing masks.\n\nOverall, the controversy surrounding Trump's social media use highlights the ongoing debate over how much power and control the president should have over the media and public opinion, and whether his actions on social media can be considered legitimate or harmful.

The new system, which will be implemented in the coming weeks, involves moving from five boarding lanes to two, with priority passengers being served through lane 1 and non-actively boarding passengers being asked to remain seated until paged. The airline is also launching push notifications for passengers who have the airline's mobile app, which will inform them when boarding has started and give them a tool to manage their boarding group. The new boarding process aims to address overcrowding at gates, which has become an unwelcome side effect of full flights. The airline expects the new system to reduce travel times and drive economic benefits for consumers and communities. The new system is part of a larger effort to streamline its operations and improve the customer experience, including the integration of its complementary route networks into a collaborative revenue-sharing JBA with Copa, Aerovías del Continente Americano S.A. (Avianca), and many of Avianca's affiliates. The new system is expected to benefit customers, communities, and the marketplace for air travel between the United States and 19 countries in Central and South America. The airline is also planning to apply for regulatory approval of the JBA and an accompanying grant of antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation and other regulatory agencies. The new system is designed to ensure that flights depart on time as more travelers opt to fly, rather than having to stand in line to hold their spot. The airline is also addressing the issue of pre-boarding line-ups, which can lead to frustration, crowding, and unpleasantness.

Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up.

Kieran was born deaf with small lobes where his ears should have been, and he had a rare condition called microtia, affecting one in 100,000 babies in the UK. Despite his hearing loss, Kieran has gradually been able to hear through a hearing aid and has expressed a desire to have big ears. However, the procedure to create the ears was initially considered cosmetic and aimed at improving Kieran's appearance rather than enhancing his hearing. The procedure involved removing cartilage from six of Kieran's ribs and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The framework was inserted in pockets in the skin and then suctioned to take on the shape of an ear on both sides. The surgery was performed on a Wednesday morning, and the team removed cartilage from six of Kieran's ribs. The surgery was cosmetic, not to improve hearing, but it brought huge psychological benefits, including increased confidence and improved performance at school. Researchers at the Institute of Child Health, part of University College London, are working on tissue engineering to create stem cells from patients' fat tissue, which could potentially be used to create a new ear. The Institute is conducting studies to induce the cells to make cartilage or bone, and the results are expected to be available within the next decade. The article also mentions advances in tissue engineering, which allow for the creation of new ear frameworks and other skeletal structures from a patient's own stem cells.

The habeas corpus petition is a crucial tool for challenging detention and ensuring due process. The United States Constitution enshrines habeas corpus as a cornerstone of the legal system, protecting citizens' liberty, justice, and democracy. The MCA, a law passed in 2006, has reversed the right to habeas corpus for anyone detained at Guantánamo Bay and for any foreigner the government detains anywhere and labels an \"enemy combatant.\" The MCA applies to legal residents of the US, including those who have lived in the US for years, potentially leading to the labeling of an individual as an \"enemy combatant\" and imprisonment without legal recourse. The Supreme Court recently ruled that the habeas corpus petition of Hercules and Leo, two research chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, should be allowed to proceed, marking the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus. The ruling could force the university to release the primates, potentially influencing other judges to do the same with other research animals. The case has sparked debate over the treatment of chimpanzees and other animals, with some arguing that they are entitled to bodily liberty and others advocating for their return to established chimpanzee sanctuaries. The Nonhuman Rights Project, a nonprofit organization, has filed a series of habeas corpus petitions challenging the detention of chimpanzees and other animals, and the Supreme Court's decision could pave the way for further legal action.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

The Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals, making it illegal to import illegally harvested wood. However, Gibson has maintained that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law. The company has denied the allegations of trafficking, stating that all of its imports from Madagascar have been legal. The Justice Department has stated that Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband, and it quotes emails that seem to show the company taking steps to maintain a supply chain that's been connected to illegal timber harvests. The company has presented documents to support its claim, and the recent raid seized legally obtained wood from India. The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, has expressed concern over the potential impact of the charges on the company's business and the吉他 industry as a whole. The Justice Department has defended the Lacey Act and its efforts to enforce it, stating that it aims to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that buyers must be asking questions and sourcing wood responsibly. The company's lawyer, Ronald Bienstock, has warned clients to be wary of traveling abroad with old guitars, as the law states that owners can be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The company has also faced criticism for trying to create exemptions to cover vintage instruments, which are rife with delays and to play it safe, Gruhn has nearly eliminated the 40% of his business that used to deal with overseas buyers.

{"pred": "The three news articles discuss the discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars, which is estimated to have covered a significant portion of the planet's surface four billion years ago. The ocean was enriched in deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, to a level of seven times that of Earth's ocean, indicating a large-scale water loss. The study, conducted by a team of scientists led by Geronimo Villanueva, used infrared telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere over six years and analyzed the chemical composition of the vapor present in the atmosphere. The data showed that water on Mars had a higher proportion of deuterium than Earth, with an average value of 7 VSMOW (Volcanic Mass Water Fraction), compared to Earth's 1 VSMOW. The ocean on Mars was likely formed during the formation of the planet, and its existence suggests that Mars may have been habitable in the distant past. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the chemical composition of the Martian atmosphere to better understand the potential for life on the planet. The findings of the study have implications for the search for life on Mars, with the possibility that the ocean on Mars could provide a habitat for life in the future. The study provides further evidence that Mars was once much wetter than it is today, with much of the water being in liquid form rather than in the icy polar caps where it is currently locked up. The findings also suggest that the ancient chemical environment on Mars was hospitable to life, providing conditions that could support the emergence of life.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The movie follows a veteran con man named Nicky Spurgeon, played by Will Smith, who teams up with a young woman named Jess Barrett, played by Margot Robbie, to con wealthy individuals at various locations. The film's premise is that Nicky uses his confidence and expertise to manipulate others, and the duo engages in a series of elaborate schemes, including stealing from casinos, racetracks, and football games.\n\nThe article highlights the casting choices for the film, with Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck initially considered for the role of the con man, but ultimately settling on Will Smith and Margot Robbie. The film's director, Glenn Ficarra, and writer, John Requa, were praised for their decision to cast Smith, who previously appeared in films such as Independence Day, I Am Legend, Hancock, and After Earth, as the dapper-con genre's protagonist. The article notes that Smith's portrayal of Nicky is refreshingly different from his previous roles, as he is portrayed as a confident and charismatic conman rather than a stoic and menacing figure.\n\nThe article also discusses the film's plot, which revolves around Nicky and Jess's con scheme, as well as the challenges they face in executing their plans. The film's central conflict is the tension between Nicky's desire to succeed in the con world and his growing disillusionment with the lifestyle he has created for himself. The article notes that the film's humor lies in the contrast between Nicky's cool demeanor and his eventual realization that he cannot fool everyone.\n\nThe article also touches on the film's cast, with Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck mentioned as potential leads for the con man role, but ultimately settling on Will Smith and Margot Robbie. The article notes that Smith's performance as Nicky is praised for his ability to convey the character's confidence and charisma, while Margot Robbie's portrayal of Jess is noted for her comedic timing and chemistry with Smith.\n\nOverall, the three news articles provide a comprehensive overview of the film \"Focus,\" highlighting its cast, plot, and themes.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer model that matches features of YouTube videos, such as colors, shapes, and movements, with patterns of brain activity. By analyzing the brain activity during a series of YouTube videos watched by study subjects, the team was able to reconstruct the videos as seen by the mind's eye, creating a blurry, dreamlike version of the video. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize the field of neuroscience, offering insights into our dreams, memories, and even fantasies.\n\nThe study involved participants wearing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine and watching two sets of movie trailers for several hours at a time. The MRI captured the amount of blood flowing through the visual cortex, the part of the brain responsible for processing visual information. The researchers then used this data to train a computer model that matched neural activity to the dynamic visual experiences, learning to associate certain patterns with specific features of the videos.\n\nDuring the reconstruction process, subtle changes in blood flow to visual areas of the brain, measured by functional MRI, predicted what was on the screen at the time, including scenes from popular TV shows like Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau or airplanes. The reconstructed videos are blurry due to the layers of YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity pattern, highlighting the importance of capturing the full range of visual information.\n\nThe technology has the potential to be applied beyond just visual perception, as it could potentially be used to broadcast imagery, such as scenes that play out inside our minds independent from vision. This could have applications in fields like entertainment, education, and medical diagnosis, where individuals with paralysis or other impairments could use the technology to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements.\n\nHowever, the potential uses of this technology in court cases remain uncertain. While the technology could potentially provide misleading information about faulty memories, it would require further research to determine whether it could be used in a court setting. Additionally, the nature of memories and their accuracy would likely limit the application of this technology in court proceedings.\n\nOverall, the development of a computer model that can reconstruct dynamic visual experiences has opened up exciting possibilities for understanding the brain's role in perception and cognition. While the technology has the potential to revolutionize various fields, further research is needed to fully realize its potential and ensure that it is used ethically and responsibly.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

In 2011, a team of French government investigators working on the Air France hunt located the wreckage, and they believe that a deliberate act caused the disappearance. The team used Bayesian statistics named after a British Presbyterian minister called Thomas Bayes to analyze the data and assess the likelihood of different scenarios. The team split up the search area into a grid and applied a probability map to each cell, taking into account the likelihood of the plane being found in each location. The team adjusted the probability map based on new information, such as the flight path, wind, ocean flow, and which areas had been searched already. The team also considered the likelihood of the plane crashing due to mechanical failures, historical data from previous crashes, and the fact that the plane was flying in a region known for unpredictable currents. The team concluded that the probability of the plane being found in the area where the debris was found was high, but the probability of the plane being found in locations that had already been searched was low. The team also assessed the likelihood of the plane crashing due to pilot error, and they believed that the pilots were given faulty speed readings, responded inappropriately, and lost control of the plane.

Durst was arrested in March 2015 following a search of his hotel room in downtown New Orleans, where he was found with a loaded Smith and Wesson .38-caliber revolver. The gun charge stems from a search of Durst's room on March 14, 2015, which turned up a flesh-colored latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair, five ounces of marijuana, more than $100,000 in cash, and a loaded Smith and Wesson .38-caliber revolver. Durst maintains his innocence and has repeatedly stated that he is not guilty of killing Susan Berman. Durst's defense team requested that he be sent to a low-security federal prison facility in California, where he would face a murder trial in Berman's death. However, U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt approved a plea agreement for Durst to serve about 7 years, 1 month in prison on a weapons charge.

The first article provides a summary of the initial report released by the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which stated that the attack was a result of an anti-Islamic video posted online. The report includes a timeline contrasting the story presented by top Obama administration officials with the actual events that transpired. The timeline highlights the differing perspectives of Secretary Clinton, who initially claimed that the attack was a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet, while some of her colleagues believed it was a coordinated terrorist attack involving al-Qaeda. The report also reveals that State Department officials raised concerns about the appropriateness of wearing civilian clothing instead of military uniforms, and that a State official requested that the US military avoid deploying to Benghazi due to concerns about the risk of flags being displayed. The second article focuses on the supplemental report released by the House Select Committee, which adds context to the initial report by providing a timeline that contrasts the story presented by top Obama administration officials with the actual events that transpired. The timeline emphasizes the differences between the public and private statements made by Secretary Clinton and her colleagues, highlighting the role of the White House in shaping the narrative surrounding the attack. The third article discusses the aftermath of the attack, with Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) stating that the Select Committee's investigation was one of the lowest points of his career. He criticized the lack of transparency and accountability regarding the investigation, particularly in regards to the release of intelligence reports that contradicted the public's understanding of the event. The fourth article summarizes the full report released by the House Select Committee, which concludes that the attack was a result of inadequate planning and coordination by the US government, and that the former secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, and other officials failed to adequately address concerns about growing extremism in Libya.

The fake login page was designed to look like the access page, but upon closer inspection, it was found to be a sophisticated attempt to gain unauthorized access to the party's database. The DNC suspects that the attackers may have gained access to sensitive information such as voter registration data, candidate profiles, and fundraising materials.\n\nThe FBI is currently conducting a thorough investigation into the incident, with the aim of identifying the perpetrators and determining the extent of the damage caused to the DNC's computer systems. The agency is also working closely with other law enforcement agencies and intelligence partners to gather more information about the attack and to identify any potential links or connections between the incident and other ongoing cyberattacks.\n\nIn addition to the DNC's investigation, the US government has taken steps to enhance cybersecurity measures and protect critical infrastructure, including voting systems and other election-related databases. This includes the deployment of new technologies and protocols to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts, as well as the implementation of stricter regulations and guidelines for the handling of personal and sensitive information.\n\nOverall, the recent cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee highlights the growing threat posed by cybercriminals and the need for increased vigilance and preparedness in the digital age. As the 2022 midterm elections approach, political groups and government organizations will continue to face challenges related to cybersecurity, and it remains crucial for individuals and organizations to take proactive steps to safeguard their sensitive information and protect themselves from potential attacks.", "answers": ["The FBI is reportedly investigating a sophisticated—but unsuccessful—attempt to hack into the Democratic National Committee's voter database.

The latest report by the University of Washington-Seattle's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation provides a comprehensive overview of obesity rates across 188 countries between 1980 and 2013. The study found that obesity rates have risen significantly in many parts of the world, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands. The highest rates of obesity were observed in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain, while the US had the largest percentage of obese individuals, accounting for 13% of the total population. In contrast, the US claimed only 5% of its population, highlighting the disproportionate impact of obesity on wealthier nations.\n\nThe study highlights the complex factors contributing to obesity, such as increased calorie intake, changes in diet composition, decreased physical activity, and the rise of sedentary lifestyles. The availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, and high-calorie foods, along with the rise of sedentary lifestyles, has contributed to the obesity epidemic. Obesity is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, leading to chronic complications that claim millions of lives annually.\n\nThe study also noted that obesity rates have been increasing at an alarming pace in developing countries, with more than 58% of adult men and 65% of adult women overweight or obese. The problem is particularly acute in the Middle East and North Africa, where obesity rates have risen nearly 50% in children and adolescents worldwide. The US, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia are among the top 10 countries with the highest rates of obesity, with the US accounting for more than half of the world's obese population.\n\nThe report emphasizes the need for urgent action to address the obesity crisis, particularly in developing countries. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and propose solutions. The report suggests that addressing obesity requires a multi-faceted approach, including improving access to healthy food options, promoting physical activity, and reducing sedentary behaviors.\n\nOverall, the study underscores the severity of the obesity crisis and calls for a concerted effort to reduce the prevalence of obesity and related health problems.

The letter suggests that Cruise has taken the initiative to reconnect with Holmes, despite their separation, and may offer reconciliation if possible. The article highlights the significance of the letter, as it marks a significant turning point in their relationship and could potentially lead to a rekindling of their connection.\n\nPassage 2 discusses Tom Cruise's recent decision to write an emotional letter to Katie Holmes, following their divorce in July 2021. The letter, according to sources close to the couple, was intended to express his love and concern for her, acknowledging her departure from his life. The letter was sent in March, but it was not successful due to the fact that it was too soon for Katie to be receptive to the message. However, the letter has reportedly had a positive impact on Holmes, as she has been genuinely touched by the gesture and has expressed gratitude for the letter.\n\nPassage 3 focuses on the history of Alexa Internet, a company that has donated its crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996.

The final nine governorates have also been allocated seats, with the Brotherhood's strongholds of Gharbiya and Daqahliyya in the Delta receiving significant support. The Brotherhood has stated that it aims to form a coalition or unity government, in part to avoid unnerving Egyptian liberals or Westerners who may fear an Islamist takeover.

The trial began Aug. 3 but has been bogged down in procedural matters, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding Judge Ahmed Rifaat be removed. If convicted of complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters in the crackdown on a popular uprising that forced him out of office on Feb. 11, Mubarak could face the death penalty.

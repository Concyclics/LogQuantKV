Kalashnikov was born in 1925 and grew up during the Soviet era, where the Red Army's lack of weapons led to a need for a reliable and affordable firearm. After receiving the order to defend his country, Kalashnikov began working on the AK-47, which he initially designed to be a tool for self-defense rather than a weapon for mass murder. Kalashnikov's decision to create the AK-47 was influenced by his experiences with the Russian military's reliance on the weapon during World War II, where it proved to be a formidable force against enemy forces.\n\nThe AK-47 became a symbol of resistance against terrorism and child soldiers, with Kalashnikov receiving numerous honors, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labor. Despite his dedication to the cause, Kalashnikov struggled with feelings of guilt and moral responsibility for the deaths of innocent civilians, particularly those associated with terrorist groups like the Islamic State (IS). Kalashnikov's letter to the Russian Orthodox Church's Patriarch Kirill, which was published in Izvestia, expressed his inner turmoil over the loss of lives and the desire to seek forgiveness for any perceived wrongdoing.\n\nThe press secretary for the Russian Orthodox Church, Cyril Alexander Volkov, confirmed that the head of the church had received the letter and responded with a personal letter acknowledging the importance of protecting the Fatherland and supporting the designers of the AK-47. Kalashnikov's的设计灵感 was drawn from his experiences during the war, where the Russian army faced a shortage of weapons, making the AK-47 a practical solution for defending his country.\n\nKalashnikov's story highlights the complexities of the relationship between the designer and the military, as well as the moral responsibility that comes with creating a weapon that may be used for political purposes. The AK-47's widespread adoption and its role in shaping modern warfare have also raised questions about the ethics of arms production and the potential consequences of using lethal force in conflict.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

The suspect, identified as Paul Ciancia, was shot four times by airport police officers, including two who were assigned to the scene.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

The researchers at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and the University of Pavia in Italy used real and synthetic blood samples to analyze the bloodstains on the cloth. The team found that the bloodstains on the cloth are inconsistent with each other, suggesting that it may not be a true depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus. The researchers concluded that the cloth is likely a medieval forgery, possibly created to cover up the truth about the crucifixion. The team tested the cloth on a living model, comparing the flow of blood on the cloth to the images of crucifixion wounds on the Shroud of Turin.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The following news articles provide a comprehensive overview:\n\n1. News Article 1:\n   - New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised President Barack Obama for his re-election chances, stating that the president is a credible and formidable candidate who will face a competitive race. He criticized Perry's and Romney's positions on various issues, including the use of anti-science positions and the failure of Perry's 2007 executive order on HPV vaccination, which led to criticism from Perry's opponents. Bloomberg also praised Governor Chris Christie for his leadership skills and offered support for his potential candidacy, saying he should run and potentially challenge the president in the 2012 election.\n\n2. News Article 2:\n   Indiana Governor Mike Pence, who has previously considered running for the White House, has suggested that fellow Republicans should forgive Perry's uneven debate performances and offer leniency to the Tea Party-affiliated Republican Party. He believes that the current political climate is becoming increasingly irrelevant and that the party should focus on the upcoming debates and the candidates' positions on key issues.\n\n3.

He stated that the slogan is outdated and implies that the party should prioritize building schools in Iraq and supporting every dollar spent on disaster relief, regardless of the military's involvement. Warner's comments suggest that the party may consider military action as a possible solution to the ongoing conflict between the US and Pakistan.\n\n4.

He argues that the US must defend its troops and ensure that Pakistan takes responsibility for the actions of its intelligence agencies, which he believes are contributing to anti-American terrorism. Plouffe suggests that the US may continue to reduce aid to Pakistan if necessary, emphasizing the importance of deterring the Haqqani group's activities.\n\n5.

The tax, which applies to beverages that list milk as their primary ingredient, has led to a significant increase in the price of soda, causing many retailers to post signs indicating that customers can purchase the product outside the city limits without paying the tax. The tax has also had negative impacts on local businesses, with some reporting a decrease in sales and customers leaving the area. The Seattle City Council is currently exploring ways to address the issue, including increasing the tax on other sugary drinks and implementing a ban on sugary drinks sold in grocery stores. The Seattle City Council is also seeking to pass a bill that would require retailers to sell the tax-free option to customers. The Seattle City Council is concerned about the potential impact of the tax on small businesses and the long-term effects on health and economic growth. The Seattle City Council is also looking for alternative solutions to the tax, such as increasing the tax on sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient. The Seattle City Council is seeking input from the beverage industry and other stakeholders to ensure that the tax is effective in reducing sugar consumption and promoting healthier choices.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

However, Senate Democrats have refused to accept any changes to the health law, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any bill that includes the amendment.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged.

The malware was able to infiltrate the Point-of-Sale (POS) systems of Target stores, which were vulnerable due to software coding expertise in Eastern Europe. The report from a computer firm hired by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) detailed the types of software used in the attack, including memory scraping, which allowed the attackers to extract data from the point-of-sale systems without encrypting it.

The discovery of Planet Nine challenges the traditional definition of a planet, as it is currently the fourth largest planet in the solar system, but it remains elusive and requires a detection using advanced telescopes. The discovery of Planet Nine has led to a renewed interest in the solar system's formation and the role of Planet Nine in shaping the solar system's trajectory, but it is not confirmed by direct observation. The discovery of Planet Nine has also raised questions about the true nature of Pluto, with Brown and Batygin stating that it is not a planet but rather a \"massive perturber\" that influences the orbits of the inner solar system.

The study involved monitoring the weight and body weight of 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over a median of five years. The study found that those with the highest weight variability, defined as those experiencing large fluctuations in weight, had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death. The study also found that individuals with larger weight fluctuations had a higher risk of heart disease, including a 117% higher risk of heart attack, 124% higher risk of stroke, and 136% higher risk of death. The study suggests that individuals with yo-yo dieting may face a greater risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including heart attacks, strokes, and death, compared to those with less frequent weight fluctuations. The study emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy weight but highlights the potential negative effects of yo-yo dieting on cardiovascular health. The study's findings highlight the need for individuals with pre-existing CAD to adopt a balanced and sustainable approach to weight management, rather than relying solely on weight fluctuations. The study's methodology involves tracking weight and body weight over a prolonged period, which allows for the assessment of the relationship between weight fluctuations and the risk of heart disease. The study's findings raise concerns about the long-term impact of yo-yo dieting on individuals with pre-existing CAD, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and potential triggers for weight fluctuations in this population.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the film \"Detroit\" is a powerful and disturbing portrayal of the racial divide and injustice that existed during that time. The film follows the story of the Algiers Motel siege, where the police officers responsible for the deaths of the three Black men were acquitted, but the film's depiction of the violence and cruelty committed by the police officers is stark and relentless. The film's protagonist, Mark Boal, and screenwriter Mark Twain, who previously worked on \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"The Hurt Locker,\" aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the events, but the film lacks a clear perspective on the people involved. The film's central antagonist, the commanding officer of the Algiers Motel siege, is portrayed as a remorseful officer who is later revealed to be a rogue and violent force, leading to a series of unfortunate events that result in the deaths of two white visitors and the eventual conclusion that the mystery of the sniper remains unsolved. The film's graphic violence and intense atmosphere are intended to evoke a sense of anger and outrage, but the film's lack of a clear explanation leaves many questions unanswered. The film's rating of R by the Motion Picture Association of America is a testament to its subject matter, but the film's limitations and the film's portrayal of the police officers' actions may limit the audience's understanding of the events. The film's opening scene, featuring a history lesson about the racial integration of the country, sets the stage for the events that unfold throughout the film, including the Algiers Motel incident, which is a backdrop for the film's central antagonist, the police officer who is depicted as a villainous individual. The film's depiction of the police brutality and the aftermath of the riots is a chilling and harrowing experience that resonates with the viewer, leaving a lasting impression.

The author, astrophysicist and author of a paper on the subject, suggests that the three steps are necessary for a civilization to grow into a universal superpower. The paper adds a new twist by adding a new type of civilization, which is the only way to prevent the universe from becoming completely isolated in space. The author, Kardashev, proposes three levels of technological advancement, each corresponding to different stages of the universe's expansion. The first level involves capturing all of the planet's resources, the second level involves capturing all of the star's energy, and the third level involves capturing all of the energy from all the stars in the local galaxy. The author explains that advanced civilizations would recognize the inevitability of the universe expanding and would expand throughout the universe, using a massive array of satellites to capture and store energy from stars. The author suggests that such a civilization would understand the grim reality of the universe and would not simply sit idle while the universe passes them by, but would actively pursue the energy to ensure that it remains accessible to future civilizations. The author notes that any civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will expand throughout the universe, potentially leading to advanced civilizations that are thousands or even millions of years older than humanity. The author suggests that any civilization that is willing to capture and haul back to the home galaxy would have a choice between a Type I civilization, a Type II civilization, or a Type III civilization, depending on the size of the star they want to capture and use. The author notes that the universe is expanding, and any civilization that wants to maximize its ability to utilize energy will need to expand throughout the universe, potentially leading to advanced civilizations that are thousands or even millions of years older than humanity. The author suggests that the universe is not a static entity, but rather an evolving landscape of massive structures, including massive structures like the \"diameter\" of a sphere, which would focus the escape of solar energy for intelligent use.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The show's first season was a hit, with Stewart's sharp wit and sarcastic commentary on current events. However, as the show gained traction, the writers and producers, including James Dixon, had concerns about the show's potential to be taken over by a more polished, experienced comedian. Despite this, Stewart continued to advocate for the show, believing that it would appeal to a broader audience, and the writers' efforts to create a unique and distinct voice for the show. The writers' perspective was challenged, and the team of writers, including Dixon, had to convince Stewart to make changes to the show's writing. The writers' input was initially seen as a negative, but eventually, the team saw the value in bringing a fresh perspective and ensuring that the show would resonate with a wider audience. The writers' success led to a push to incorporate more of their own unique perspectives, and the team's efforts to bring a new energy and humor to the show. The show's shift towards a more mature and serious tone was met with resistance from some members of the writing staff, but he ultimately accepted the show and continued to work with it. The show's success was due to the hiring of Ben Karlin, who brought a diverse group of talented writers, but the team had to overcome initial skepticism and criticism.

The Olorgesailie Basin was once a lush, grassland ecosystem, but over time, the landscape shifted to become a desert due to climate change. The Olorgesailie Basin is home to a variety of stone tools, including handaxes, which were shaped like tears and had a rounded end and a pointed end. The researchers believe that these tools were made from obsidian, which was sourced from at least 25 to 50 kilometers away, and possibly from farther locations. The Middle Stone Age tools, consisting mainly of hand axes, were made from local rock, indicating the need for increased mobility and knowledge of resource availability. The discovery of these tools suggests a gradual shift from hunting for food to hunting and gathering, with the development of social networks and the exchange of raw materials.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

{"pred": "The article reports on a groundbreaking medical procedure performed at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital to create a pair of ears for a nine-year-old boy named Kieran Sorkin, who was born without ears due to a rare condition called microtia. The procedure involved removing the rib cartilage from both sides of Kieran's body and shaping it into a framework for his ears. The surgeon, Neil Bulstrode, extracted the necessary cartilage from the ribs and used it to create a new ear on both sides of Kieran's head. The ear was designed to resemble the shape of Kieran's mother's ears, and the surgeons carefully copied the outline of her ears using a template provided by Kieran's father. The ear was then inserted into Kieran's head through a pocket, and the skin was sculpted to fit the ear perfectly. The surgery was considered a cosmetic procedure, aimed at improving Kieran's confidence and self-esteem, rather than enhancing his hearing. The procedure involves harvesting the rib cartilage from the patient's own ribs and using it to create a new ear framework. The ear is then inserted into the patient's head, and the skin is tailored to fit the ear shape. The procedure is intended to be a cosmetic procedure, but it has the potential to significantly enhance the confidence of Kieran and improve his social interactions. The procedure is currently being researched and developed by experts at the Institute of Child Health, which aims to create a new type of ear reconstruction using stem cells from a patient's fat tissue. The researchers believe that this approach would be less invasive than harvesting the rib cartilage from the patient's own ribs, making it a promising solution for children with microtia. The procedure is expected to be completed within the next decade, and the success of the procedure will have a profound impact on the lives of children and their confidence. The procedure is a cosmetic procedure, but it has the potential to enhance Kieran's confidence and improve his overall quality of life.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage.

The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

The legislation also allows for the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes, and sets out the establishment of a licensing authority to regulate the industry.

The government claims that Gibson knowingly sourced illegally harvested woods from Madagascar, despite the fact that the company had previously purchased legally sourced materials from the same country. The government has accused Gibson of violating the Lacey Act, a century-old law that was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. The government argues that Gibson's company has maintained a supply chain that has been linked to illegal logging, and that the company has not yet provided evidence of its compliance with the law. The government has filed a court motion charging Gibson with trafficking in illegally obtained wood, citing emails that appear to show the company's maintenance of a supply chain that has been connected to illegal logging.

The ancient ocean covered a significant part of Mars' surface, with a depth of at least 450 feet (137 meters), and was likely present in the planet's polar regions. The study, led by Geronimo Villanueva at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, used three of the world's most powerful infrared telescopes to analyze the Martian atmosphere and detect the presence of water molecules with a high concentration of deuterium. The data suggests that Mars had a global ocean covering the entire planet, with a depth of at least 450 feet, and that the water was lost to space over time, leading to a significant loss of water equivalent to six times that amount currently present in Earth's oceans. The study also reveals that Mars may have had a much greater water content than previously thought, with a high proportion of heavy hydrogen, which could have contributed to the formation of a global ocean on Mars. The findings challenge previous assumptions that Mars was a dry planet with a limited water supply, suggesting that Mars may have been habitable in the past.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

The main character, Nicky, is portrayed as confident and charismatic, while the female lead, Jess, is depicted as a quick learner who learns to pick pockets from her newfound skills.

The movie's director, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, have created a unique blend of old-school charm and modern sophistication, making it a departure from traditional Hollywood romances. The film's success is attributed to the combination of Will Smith's charisma and Margie Robbie's natural talent, as well as the actors' ability to bring their characters to life.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer program that uses brain activity patterns to reconstruct YouTube videos, demonstrating a surreal, dreamlike process. The study involved participants lying in MRI machines for hours, recording brain activity and using it to create a continuous, abstract version of the original videos. The resulting reconstructed videos feature subtle changes in brain activity patterns that correspond to the content of the videos, including dreams, memories, and even the content of the viewer's imagination. The technology has the potential to provide insights into the brain's inner workings, potentially leading to advancements in neuroscience, particularly in understanding and interpreting non-visional experiences, such as dreams and memories. However, the technology's limitations lie in the complexity of the brain and the potential for misinterpretation of memories and other complex visual systems. Additionally, the technology may not yet be capable of accurately reproducing the inner workings of the human mind, especially when it comes to capturing the nuances of visual experiences, such as distinguishing between facial expressions and recognizing specific actions in court cases. The potential applications of this technology include the ability to control environments, such as in the case of individuals with paralysis, but the accuracy of the technology would depend on the nature of the memories being analyzed. Overall, the study highlights the importance of understanding the brain's inner workings and how it processes visual experiences, particularly in the realm of dreaming and memory, and the potential implications of this technology in various fields, including criminal justice and personal control.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

In 2011, a team of statisticians in France used Bayes' theorem to analyze the data and determine the probability of the plane wreckage being located in the initial search area. The team divided the search area into two regions, with the probability of the plane being found in each region based on historical data and the likelihood of the black box and cockpit voice recorder being found in each area.

The team used the historical data and the likelihood of the plane crashing in a specific sequence to calculate the probability of the plane wreckage being found in the initial search area.

The study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington's Seattle-based research center, provides the most comprehensive overview of obesity trends over the past three decades, revealing that obesity rates have risen across all regions, with the highest rates occurring in the Middle East and North Africa, followed by Asia, where obesity rates are particularly high. In the United States, obesity rates have accelerated, with 13% of the population being obese, while the remaining 87% are either overweight or obese. The study found that obesity is a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and chronic complications, affecting approximately 3.4 million adults each year. The obesity rate has significantly increased since the 1980s, with the number of obese people reaching 2.1 billion in 2013, compared to just 5% of the global population in 1980. The study found that obesity rates are increasing in both developed and developing countries, with obesity rates in the US surpassing 5%, and in developing countries, the rate of obesity is accelerating. The study also highlights the role of unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and changes in the gut microbiome in promoting obesity, which contributes to the rise in obesity rates worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has launched a commission to study the rising obesity rates among children worldwide, with a goal of publishing a report in early 2015. The study found that obesity rates are increasing in both men and women, with 28% of adult men and 47% of adult women being overweight or obese. The study also found that obesity rates are disproportionately affecting women, with 28% of women being obese, compared to 13% of men. The obesity rate in the United States has slowed in the past eight years, but the problem remains a major concern, with nearly two-thirds of the world's population living in areas with high obesity rates. The WHO has identified obesity as a major public health threat, with 2.1 billion people living with obesity, accounting for 13% of the global population.

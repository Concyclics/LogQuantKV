Kalashnikov, born in 1925 in Ukraine, developed the rifle during World War II, which saw the Russian military's severe shortage of weapons. After the war, Kalashnikov became disillusioned with the Soviet government's policies and began working on a more efficient and affordable alternative. He eventually founded the Kalashnikov Design Bureau in 1947, where he designed the AK-47, which quickly gained popularity due to its reliability and ease of use.\n\nKalashnikov's letter to the Russian Orthodox Church, dated May 2012, expresses his deep regret for the deaths caused by the AK-47. He writes that he feels morally responsible for the victims, even though he did not take direct responsibility for their deaths. The letter provides a glimpse into Kalashnikov's inner turmoil and his struggle with guilt over the weapon's impact on innocent civilians.\n\nDespite his guilt, Kalashnikov remained committed to defending his country and its people. He attended celebrations marking his 90th birthday in the Kremlin in Moscow, where he was greeted by President Vladimir Putin. The Russian Orthodox Church played a significant role in Kalashnikov's life, and he was baptized in a church at the age of 91. The Patriarch's press secretary, Alexander Volkov, confirmed that the Church received the letter and wrote a personal reply, emphasizing the Church's stance on the use of weapons for national defense.\n\nThe AK-47 revolutionized the battlefield and became a symbol of armed resistance against authoritarian regimes. It was widely manufactured and exported around the world, serving as a tool for guerrilla warfare and terrorist activities. The weapon's durability and simplicity made it a popular choice among rebels and paramilitaries, including those using child soldiers.\n\nHowever, the AK-47's widespread use also led to criticism and controversy. Some argued that the weapon contributed to the rise of terrorism and human rights abuses, particularly in countries like Saudi Arabia, where it was used by extremist groups. The Russian Orthodox Church's response to Kalashnikov's guilt was to emphasize the importance of protecting the Fatherland and supporting the soldiers who wielded the weapon.\n\nIn conclusion, Kalashnikov's letter to the Russian Orthodox Church reflects his moral conscience and his struggle with guilt over the AK-47's impact on innocent civilians.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability.

Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

Since January 1, 2016, the CDC has confirmed 50 cases of AFM in 24 states, compared to just 21 cases in 2015. The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to viral infections, including enteroviruses, which are common and can cause mild illnesses in children. When enteroviruses enter the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. The symptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The best way to prevent AFM is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM. The incidence of AFM has increased significantly since 2014, coinciding with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68. The CDC has issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing. As of November 13, 2016, 88 cases had been reported in 32 states, with a median age of 7.6 years and 54% of cases being males.

{"pred": "The Shroud of Turin, a centuries-old artifact believed to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, has been subjected to a new forensic investigation by researchers from Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Pavia in Italy. The shroud, which measures 14 feet long, 3.5 feet wide, and is kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case, has been analyzed for decades, with radiocarbon dating determining its origin to be between 1260 and 1390 CE. The investigation focused on the bloodstain pattern on the cloth, which showed inconsistent blood spatters that suggested it may be a medieval fraud. The researchers used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the better-defined left side of the cloth (also comparing the two liquids to see if they flowed the same way). They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. If it was a death shroud of a bleeding, executed person, hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, Borrini said, \"the bloodstains shouldn't be so inconsistent.\" The researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric: the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back, along with a belt of blood (whether it is actually blood or paint pigments is another disputed forensic question) at the waist. By pumping blood onto a model at wound points depicted on the shroud, they could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction seen on the linen. They discovered the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part: The forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, for example, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees. A simulated spear wound in the chest ran in completely different patterns than the one on the shroud, whether standing or prone. \"This is just not what happens to a person on a cross,\" Borrini said. The researchers concluded that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands,", "answers": ["The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion; bloodstains on the linen shroud, which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb, form the image of a crucified man.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports. As the researchers put it, the stains are \"totally unrealistic\" when compared to what they should look like. The shroud, which is held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Italy, is considered an icon, as opposed to a genuine religious relic, by the Vatican; Fox News notes \"the church has never weighed in on its authenticity.\" \"This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,\" the forensic scientist who conducted the analysis tells BuzzFeed News. \"Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.\" The study found inconsistent staining, with researchers concluding multiple poses were used to create the bloodstains—a standing model was likely used to imprint patterns on the cloth at various angles for various body parts. Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Davis' second pregnancy occurred in 1996, during which she took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors initially told her didn't warrant concern. However, a later exam revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides, making it a medical necessity to terminate the pregnancy. Davis sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind, and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery. Despite the risks, Davis ultimately decided to terminate the pregnancy, citing the baby's suffering and the potential for complications. The book details her experience of delivering the baby by cesarean section and the emotional aftermath of the loss. Davis' memoir sheds light on the challenges faced by women facing serious fetal abnormalities and the importance of access to healthcare. It also highlights the controversy surrounding her abortion stance, particularly her decision to reveal the terminations during her filibuster in the Texas Senate in 2013.

However, subsequent investigations revealed that the story was a fabrication, with no evidence linking the suspects to the murders. The police chief, Miguel Hidalgo, announced that Felix would be placed on indefinite leave from his position for tarnishing the reputation of his unit.

The PCTA estimates that more than 4,000 long-distance hiking permits have been issued this year, with around 3,000 people attempting the Northbound thru-hike. The PCTA has implemented a quota system to distribute the number of hikers evenly across the trail, with a limit of 50 permits per day. The goal of the quota system is to reduce wear on the trail and environmental damage, especially in the desert regions. The PCTA has also launched a campaign to promote safety and \"leave no trace\" practices, including protecting water quality, burying human waste, packing out trash, and building safe campfires. The PCTA has emphasized the importance of respecting the trail's ecosystem and avoiding damaging areas.

She was best known as the co-star and co-chef of the BBC's Two Fat Ladies, a popular cooking show that aired from 1996 to 2003. The show featured the duo traveling around the UK in their motorcycle-sidecar, discussing various dishes and topics related to food and cuisine. Dickson Wright was a talented cook and a passionate food historian, known for her unconventional approach to cooking and her ability to make complex recipes accessible to viewers. She was also a champion of hunting and shooting, and her views on vegetarianism were often criticized for being unorthodox. Despite her controversial comments about hunting, Dickson Wright was a beloved figure in the culinary world and was widely respected for her intelligence, humor, and dedication to her craft. Her passing left a void in the world of television and food, and her legacy continues to inspire chefs and food enthusiasts alike. Dickson Wright's books, such as \"A History of English Food,\" chronicled her experiences as a cook and her passion for the culinary arts. She was also a passionate advocate for rural life and the Countryside Alliance, and her work with students as the Rector of the University of Aberdeen was highly regarded.

{"pred": "Seattle's new sugary drink tax, which was introduced in 2018, has had a significant impact on the city's economy and residents' purchasing habits. The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold, making it more expensive for consumers. The tax applies to soda, sports drinks, kombucha, and other sugary beverages that don't list milk as their first ingredient. The tax has led to a decrease in sales of these products, especially at Costco, which saw a 34% decline in sales of beverages affected by the tax. The tax also impacted local businesses, with some retailers experiencing higher prices and decreased sales. The tax has also generated legal challenges, including a lawsuit against the city and a request for a restraining order to prevent the tax from taking effect. Despite these challenges, the tax has been supported by the beverage industry and some local officials, who argue that it helps to reduce sugar consumption and promote healthier lifestyles. However, some residents and businesses are concerned about the tax's impact on their bottom line and the potential loss of jobs.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

{"pred": "A new study conducted in Denmark has suggested that pregnant women who frequently take acetaminophen, a common pain reliever, may be at a higher risk of having children later diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and related conditions. The study analyzed data from the Danish National Birth Cohort study between 1996 and 2002, which included over 64,000 children. The researchers found that women who took acetaminophen more than twice per week had a 29% higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD, compared to women who took it less frequently. Additionally, women who reported taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy had a 50% increased risk of receiving ADHD medication.\n\nThe study authors attributed the increased risk to acetaminophen's potential interference with maternal hormones that are crucial for fetal brain development. They cited a previous study done using acetaminophen in rats and a study of acetaminophen and autism done with humans, both of which suggested that acetaminophen may contribute to the development of ADHD.\n\nThe study authors advise pregnant women to avoid taking acetaminophen frequently until more research is conducted to understand its potential impact on child development. They emphasize that the risk-benefit ratio cannot be ignored, and taking a large dose of acetaminophen can lead to serious health consequences, including liver damage and even death.\n\nThe study's authors suggest alternative pain management strategies, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture, as well as non-pharmacological approaches like exercise and stress reduction. They caution against relying solely on medications for pain relief during pregnancy, as there are numerous factors that need to be considered, including the presence of ADHD in the family.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of considering the potential risks associated with acetaminophen during pregnancy and advises pregnant women to consult with their healthcare providers before taking any medication. The study's findings suggest that while acetaminophen may be a useful pain reliever in certain circumstances, it is not without potential risks and should only be used as directed.", "answers": ["The bad news about acetaminophen just keeps on coming: A new study finds that use of the drug during pregnancy is linked to \"ADHD-like behavioral problems\" in children, CNN reports.

Cohen accused the network of using the term \"shake-up\" inaccurately, stating that the hires of campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and CEO Stephen Bannon were not significant changes to the campaign's direction. Instead, Cohen argued that the hires were part of a broader effort to improve the campaign's performance in key battleground states, particularly in Virginia and Colorado, where Trump currently trails Hillary Clinton by double digits. Cohen also criticized the media's portrayal of the shake-up, suggesting that the network was focusing too much on negative aspects of the hires rather than highlighting their positive impact on the campaign.\n\nDuring the interview, Keilar pressed Cohen on the significance of the hires, asking whether they represented a significant change in the campaign's strategy. Cohen responded by stating that the hires were simply part of a larger effort to address the challenges facing the campaign, including low ratings and a lack of momentum in certain states. Cohen emphasized that the hires were not a sudden departure from the campaign's previous leadership structure, but rather a strategic move aimed at improving the team's ability to effectively communicate with voters and execute its messaging.\n\nDespite Cohen's defense of the hires, Keilar continued to push back, challenging the notion that the shake-up was a significant shift in the campaign's direction. She suggested that the hires were not enough to overcome the current polling deficit and that the campaign needed to make other changes, such as addressing issues related to voter engagement and messaging, in order to regain momentum.\n\nThe interview between Cohen and Keilar generated significant attention on social media, with many users responding with \"#SaysWho?\" tweets in response to Cohen's comments.

Chaney, who was a supervisor in the Secret Service's international programs division, was caught making light of his official protective work on his Facebook page, joking about a picture of himself standing watch behind Palin. The scandal came to light after a friend commented on the photo, prompting Chaney to post multiple shots of himself with Palin, including one in which he was standing behind her during the campaign. Chaney's comments were deemed inappropriate and led to his termination from the agency. The scandal has raised questions of accountability and personal conduct within the agency, particularly in light of the fact that the president's security in Cartagena was never compromised during the event. The Secret Service has since fired three of the 11 employees involved in the scandal, including two supervisors, and has announced that three others are being dismissed for their involvement. The scandal has also involved 10 military personnel and as many as 20 Colombian women, and has sparked calls for leadership changes within the agency. Rep. Peter King, a Republican from New York, has called for leadership changes and said that the scandal raises questions about whether Obama was capable of leading the government. The scandal has also raised concerns about the agency's handling of sensitive missions, such as the protection of the president, and has prompted calls for greater transparency and accountability within the organization. The Secret Service has stated that it is conducting an investigation into the incident and that no decision has yet been made regarding the charges against Chaney and Stokes.

However, Senate Democrats have rejected any changes to the healthcare law, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any bill that includes the repeal.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Named after Eugene Parker, a leading astrophysicist, the mission aims to collect data on the solar wind and its impact on the Earth's magnetic field, as well as the heating of the sun's corona. The Parker Solar Probe will travel to the sun's surface, where it will observe the solar wind and its interactions with the Earth's magnetic field. The spacecraft will be equipped with advanced sensors and instruments to study the solar wind, including the Parker Solar Wind Experiment (PSPX), which will measure the solar wind's properties and study its acceleration and behavior. The mission is expected to provide valuable insights into the sun's magnetic field, solar wind, and the underlying physics of space weather, including the interaction of charged particles with the Earth's magnetic field. The Parker Solar Probe will also study the solar wind's impact on the Earth's climate and space weather, including the potential effects on satellite systems and power grids. The mission's success will contribute to our understanding of the sun's role in shaping the solar system and its impact on the global economy and society. The Parker Solar Probe will also serve as a testbed for new technologies and techniques, such as advanced solar shielding and the integration of space weather data into existing systems.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The planet, estimated to be between five and ten times the mass of Earth, orbits beyond Neptune's path and is located at a distance of billions of miles. The discovery was made using mathematical and computer modeling, and the two researchers, Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, predict that it will be detected within the next five years. The IAU, the international organization responsible for defining planets, has already stated that it will not classify Planet Nine as a planet due to its distance from the sun. However, the discovery has sparked renewed interest in Pluto, which was demoted from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006 due to its proximity to the sun. The debate over Pluto's status has continued, with some scientists advocating for its reinstatement as a planet and others arguing that it is not a planet. The discovery of Planet Nine has also raised questions about the definition of a planet and the need for a new classification system. Professor Mike Brown, who is often referred to as the \"Pluto killer,\" has expressed no regrets about his role in Pluto's demotion and believes that it is necessary for the advancement of scientific knowledge. The discovery of Planet Nine has also generated controversy, with some scientists arguing that it should remain a planet and others advocating for its removal from the list of planets.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

This is a significant shift from the traditional perception that colorectal cancer is primarily associated with older men. According to the study, younger patients are more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively. The study estimates that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50. The majority of younger patients (37,847 out of 258,000) were diagnosed before age 50, with 30% more likely to have tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes and 50% more likely to have cancer that had advanced to other organs. Younger patients with tumors that had metastasized, or reached other organs, were also more likely than older people to get more aggressive treatments. The study found that younger patients saw more positive results despite the tendency to have more advanced disease when diagnosed. However, the study lacks data on family history and other risk factors for colorectal cancers, and it's unclear whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths. The study recommends that doctors should be on the lookout for warning signs of colon cancer, such as bleeding, changes in bowel habits or pain when going to the bathroom, and refer those of concern to a gastroenterologist for a diagnostic workup.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The film explores the systemic oppression and mistreatment of Black people in the United States, focusing on the actions of the Detroit Police Department and the impact of the events on the community.\n\nThe film begins by setting the stage for the Motel siege by depicting the history of Black people in the United States, including the Great Migration, white flight, and the racial zoning practices that led to the overcrowding of black residents in urban pockets. The film then follows the events leading up to the Motel siege, including the shooting of a local singing group by the police, which triggers the riots and leads to the deaths of three teenagers.\n\nThe film portrays the police officers involved in the shootings as ruthless and violent, using excessive force and torture tactics to extract confessions from the young men they had confined in the Motel. The film also highlights the role of white police officers in exacerbating the tensions between the police and the community, as evidenced by the presence of two white girls from Ohio among the suspects.\n\nThe film's portrayal of the police officers is criticized by some for failing to provide sufficient insight into the victims' lives outside of the event, and for not addressing the systemic issues that led to the Motel siege. The film also contains inaccuracies regarding the events, such as the claim that the police officers were acquitted after confessing to the murders, which is contradicted by the testimony of witnesses who were assaulted by the accused policemen themselves.\n\nDespite these criticisms, \"Detroit\" received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its powerful storytelling and immersive visuals, while others found it maddeningly imperfect and honoring the injustices committed during the Motel siege.

This step is crucial for establishing a sustainable economy and infrastructure, allowing for technological advancements and colonization of other planets.\n2. Harvest all of your nearest star's energy: This involves capturing the energy emitted by nearby stars, such as the Sun, using advanced technologies like solar sails, Dyson spheres, or gravitational traps. This step enables the development of advanced energy sources and propulsion systems, enabling faster travel through space and potentially interstellar exploration.\n3. Harvest all the energy from all the stars in your local galaxy: This involves gathering energy from all the stars within a specific region, such as the Milky Way, and distributing it to a single planet or colony. This step allows for the establishment of a centralized energy grid and infrastructure, enabling efficient distribution of resources and support for advanced civilizations.\nThe article highlights the importance of understanding the implications of universal expansion and the potential consequences of not utilizing energy effectively. It suggests that advanced civilizations must expand throughout the universe to secure as many stars as possible before they become permanently inaccessible due to the encroaching horizon. The article proposes various strategies for capturing and harnessing energy, including the creation of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures, as well as the use of solar sails and other innovative technologies.\nThe article also mentions the role of ancient extraterrestrial civilizations, estimated to be millions of years older than humanity, in shaping the future of space exploration and resource management.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "The article provides a comprehensive overview of the history of The Daily Show, a popular American political satire show that aired on Comedy Central from 1996 to 2003. The show was created by Jon Stewart, who served as the host from 1999 to 2003, and was initially intended to be a successor to Craig Kilborn's show. However, the show took a significant shift towards a more satirical and critical approach, with Stewart pushing for a higher quotient of righteous anger and a greater emphasis on the news itself, rather than simply mocking it.\n\nDuring the Kilborn era, The Daily Show often focused on local news and pop culture, with a particular interest in skewering the news media and its tendency to oversimplify complex issues. However, Stewart's tenure as host led to a change in the show's tone and point of view, with a greater emphasis on exposing the flaws and hypocrisies of mainstream news sources.\n\nIn 1999, Stewart brought in Ben Karlin as the head writer, and the team began to develop a new style of humor that was more sophisticated and nuanced. This shift in direction was reflected in the hiring of David Jaeger as the first writer, who would later become the executive producer and oversee the show's production. The team also introduced a new segment called \"The Fuck-You Meeting,\" which involved a confrontation between Stewart and the remaining writers of The Daily Show, resulting in a significant change in the dynamic of the show.\n\nAs the show continued to evolve, Stewart and his team faced challenges from the network and the media, particularly with the rise of cable news networks and the increasing popularity of online news sources. In 2000, the show shifted gears and began to explore more serious topics, such as the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton and the 1990 Gulf War. This shift was met with criticism from some quarters, who accused the show of being too harsh and lacking a sense of humor.\n\nDespite these challenges, The Daily Show remained a major player in the alternative news landscape, with a loyal fan base and a dedicated crew of writers and performers. In 2003, Stewart stepped down as host, leaving behind a legacy of sharp wit, incisive commentary, and a commitment to using humor to challenge the status quo.\n\nOver the course of its run, The Daily Show received critical acclaim for its sharp political satire and its ability to engage audiences on a deeper level.

Santorum also mentioned that he did not believe there was any issue with the way his supporters at CPAC turned out, emphasizing that he did not want to engage in rigging straw polls.\nRomney's campaign responded to Santorum's statement, saying that Santorum had a history of making statements that were not grounded in the truth.

{"pred": "The discovery of ancient Middle Stone Age tools in Kenya, dating back to around 320,000 years ago, provides new insights into the evolution of early human societies and the impact of climate change on tool-making and trade networks. The oldest tools discovered were hand axes, which were shaped like tear drops and had a rounded end and a pointed eye. The edges were wavy and sharp, indicating their effectiveness for chopping down branches or processing meat. The next technological revolution, marked by the emergence of Middle Stone Age implements, occurred tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought, with the first Middle Stone Age tools appearing around 300,000 years ago. The team found that these tools were made from obsidian, which originated far from Olorgesailie, and were transported from 15 to 30 miles away. The team also discovered evidence of exchange of brightly colored red and black rocks, which were then drilled into, possibly to extract pigment. This is the earliest evidence of the extraction of pigments, suggesting a complex culture where the ancient humans used pigments symbolically. The team's findings challenge the traditional view that modernity arose outside of Africa and instead suggest that some hominin groups, such as the Hadza people of northern Tanzania, had already developed technologically and culturally, adapting to the challenges of the changing environment. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools in the Olorgesailie Basin provides a window into the evolution of early human societies and highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between complex behaviors and hominin species from 500,000 years to 160,000 years ago.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

He also criticized Morning Joe co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, calling their tweets \"beneath the dignity\" of the presidential office.\n\nSome Republican senators, including Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, expressed concern about Trump's Twitter habit, arguing that his tweets may undermine the credibility of the presidency. Sasse specifically mentioned that Trump's tweets on Saturday were \"beneath the dignity\" of the presidential office, while Murkowski tweeted that she wanted to be remembered for her accomplishments rather than her tweets.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump promised that he would become \"so presidential\" that he would return as a presidential person, but this statement has been met with skepticism. Some critics argue that Trump's tweets are not consistent with his previous statements about being presidential, and that his behavior on social media may be a reflection of his personality rather than a strategic decision.\n\nIn addition to his tweets, Trump has also faced criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. He has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the virus, despite evidence to the contrary, and has suggested that the vaccine rollout is a \"hoax\" or a \"conspiracy theory.\" This has led to widespread confusion and frustration among the public, and has raised questions about the effectiveness of the government's response to the crisis.\n\nOverall, the controversy surrounding Trump's social media use highlights the challenges facing modern-day presidents in maintaining their authority and credibility in a rapidly changing digital landscape.

The airline is also introducing push notifications for passengers who have the airline's mobile app, which will alert them when boarding begins and provide them with information about their boarding group. The new boarding process is part of a larger effort to streamline the airline's operations and reduce the number of empty seats on planes, which can lead to higher ticket prices and decreased demand. The airline expects the new system to improve the boarding experience for customers and reduce congestion at gates, leading to faster and smoother departures.

Over time, Hooper and her husband, Gale, welcomed Cruz into their home and provided him with financial assistance and opportunities for work.

{"pred": "The Internet Archive is undertaking a project called \"Crawls for History,\" which involves archiving pages as they are created and preserving the pages that they reference. This initiative aims to address the issue of broken links on the web, which can lead to users being unable to access content or experiencing a \"404\" error. The goal is to replace broken links with archived versions of the original pages, ensuring that users have access to the information they were intended to find.\n\nThe Internet Archive has identified a list of \"No More 404\" sites, which are websites that have been removed or significantly altered since their creation. These sites are considered important historical sources and serve as a starting point for research and analysis. By archiving these pages, the Internet Archive aims to preserve the context and meaning behind them, allowing researchers and historians to access valuable information that might otherwise be lost.\n\nTo achieve this objective, the Internet Archive is conducting crawls of these No More 404 sites. During each crawl, the archive retrieves the HTML code of the site and extracts relevant data such as URLs, titles, descriptions, and images. The extracted information is then stored in a database, along with metadata about the site's history, authorship, and other relevant details.\n\nOnce the crawls are complete, the Internet Archive creates a permanent record of the archived pages, including links to the original source. This allows users to easily navigate back to the original pages and access the information they were intended to find. In addition, the archive also includes a companion link that provides additional context and information about the site, helping users understand why it was removed or altered.\n\nBy archiving these No More 404 sites, the Internet Archive is not only addressing the problem of broken links but also contributing to the preservation of important historical resources. It enables researchers, educators, and students to access a wealth of information that might otherwise be inaccessible due to the loss of the original pages. Furthermore, the archive serves as a testament to the ongoing evolution and transformation of the internet, highlighting the importance of preserving digital heritage for future generations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Internet Archive's \"Crawls for History\" initiative is a crucial step towards preserving the web's rich history and ensuring that users have access to accurate and up-to-date information. Through the archiving of \"No More 404\" sites, the Internet Archive is working to restore links to previously functioning pages, providing a vital resource for researchers, historians, and anyone interested in understanding the past.

The MCA, a law passed in 2006, has reversed the right to habeas corpus for anyone detained at Guantánamo Bay and for any foreigner the government detains anywhere and labels an \"enemy combatant.\" The MCA applies to legal residents of the US, including those who have lived in the US for years, potentially leading to the labeling of an individual as an \"enemy combatant\" and imprisonment without legal recourse. The Supreme Court recently ruled that the habeas corpus petition of Hercules and Leo, two research chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, should be allowed to proceed, marking the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus. The case has sparked controversy and raised questions about the treatment of animals in captivity and the limits of the executive branch's authority. The Nonhuman Rights Project, a nonprofit organization, has filed a habeas corpus petition challenging the detention of chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, arguing that they are too cognitively and emotionally complex to be held in captivity and should be released to an established chimpanzee sanctuary. The case has been appealed multiple times, but the Supreme Court's decision today grants the chimpanzees the right to have their day in court, potentially leading to the lifting of the ban on their transfer to a sanctuary.

The company was accused of importing ebony and rosewood from Madagascar, which were both protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the United States. The Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to include plants, was cited as the basis for the charges. The Justice Department claims that Gibson knew that its imports from Madagascar were contraband and that it took steps to maintain a supply chain that was connected to illegal timber harvests. The company maintains that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law, and that the recent raid seized legally obtained wood from India. However, the Justice Department argues that the company's actions violate the ESA by knowingly importing tainted wood. The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, expressed frustration with the investigation and stated that the company had been injured financially and that it did not have a court to defend itself. The Justice Department's motion asserts that Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband and quotes emails that appear to show the company taking steps to maintain a supply chain that was connected to illegal timber harvests. The company's attorney, Ronald Bienstock, warns clients to be wary of traveling abroad with old guitars, as the law states that owners can be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The Lacey Act also covers the trade in vintage instruments, and Nashville's George Gruhn, a leading dealer of old guitars, is concerned about the potential for unintended consequences if the law is retroactively applied to vintage instruments. The Justice Department's efforts to enforce the Lacey Act are seen as necessary to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that players must be asking questions and sourcing wood responsibly. The company's defense of the Lacey Act and the government's efforts to enforce it are ongoing, and the outcome of the charges remains uncertain.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

The ocean was enriched in deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, to a level of seven times that of Earth's ocean, indicating a large-scale water loss. The study, conducted by a team of scientists led by Geronimo Villanueva, used infrared telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere over six years and analyzed the chemical composition of the vapor present in the atmosphere. The data showed that the ordinary hydrogen in water on Mars has been slowly leaking into outer space, leading to a higher proportion of deuterium in the planet's water compared to Earth. The team calculated that the ocean on Mars would have reached a depth of about 450 feet (137 meters), and the evidence suggests that it may have formed an ocean in the northern hemisphere, which has a consistently lower altitude. The study provides new insights into the early Martian climate and the potential for life to have originated or flourished on the planet. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the water content of Mars and highlight the importance of considering the complex geology and atmospheric conditions during the formation of the planet.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer model that reconstructs YouTube videos from viewers' brain activity. The model matches features of the videos, such as colors, shapes, and movements, with patterns of brain activity recorded during the viewing process. By analyzing subtle changes in blood flow to visual areas of the brain, the researchers were able to predict what was on the screen at the time, including scenes from movies that were not directly visible to the naked eye.\n\nThe study has implications for a variety of fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence. It opens up the possibility of decoding inner images and understanding how the brain processes visual experiences, potentially leading to breakthroughs in diagnosing mental health disorders, enhancing virtual reality experiences, and even enabling individuals with paralysis to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements.\n\nHowever, the technology's limitations lie in its accuracy and the nature of the abstract visual experiences it captures. While the reconstructed videos are blurry due to the layers of YouTube clips that match the subject's brain activity pattern, the researchers believe that the technology could be used to broadcast imagery, allowing people with disabilities to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements. This could have applications in various fields, such as education, rehabilitation, and entertainment.\n\nMoreover, the study raises questions about the feasibility of using brain activity to interpret dreams, memories, and intentions. While the technology has shown promise in capturing and reconstructing visual experiences, it remains unclear whether the abstract visual experiences captured by the brain are truly representative of the real world, especially when compared to more complex areas of the brain involved in interpreting visual content.\n\nOverall, the findings of these two studies highlight the importance of understanding the brain's capabilities in processing and visualizing information, particularly in the context of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality.

He pleaded guilty to the gun charge in February and was sentenced to 85 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. Durst still faces a separate murder charge in California, in which he is accused of killing a female friend in 2000 to keep her from talking to prosecutors about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982. Durst maintains his innocence and has consistently denied any involvement in the deaths of Berman and Kathleen Durst. The HBO series \"The Jinx\" chronicled several police investigations of Durst in connection with the dismemberment killing of a male neighbor in Texas in 2003, for which he was tried and acquitted of murder, and the 1982 disappearance in New York of his wife, Kathleen.

The report includes a timeline contrasting the story presented by top Obama administration officials with the actual events that transpired. The timeline highlights the differing statements made by Secretary Clinton and other officials regarding the attack, emphasizing that the administration intentionally misled the public about the cause and consequences of the incident. The second article discusses the supplemental report released by the House Select Committee, which adds context to the initial report by providing additional details about the call between Secretary Clinton and President al Magariaf, the discussions held between acting Assistant Secretary Beth Jones and Libyan ambassador Aujali, and the phone call between State Department Deputy Secretary Thomas Nides and Egyptian ambassador to the US. The third article focuses on the testimony of witnesses and intelligence reports related to the attack, highlighting the lack of cooperation and transparency from the administration in addressing the issue. The fourth article summarizes the House Select Committee's report, which concludes that the attack was a result of inadequate planning, coordination, and oversight by the US government. The report accuses former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other officials of failing to adequately consider the growing extremism in Libya and blaming the violence on an anti-Muslim video behind unrest elsewhere. The report also contains criticisms of the administration's handling of the investigation, including the failure to provide access to transcripts and the concealment of key evidence.

{"pred": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating a recent cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee (DNC), one of the leading political parties in the United States. The investigation centers on the creation of a fake login page that was used to gain access to the party's voter database, which contains sensitive information such as names, addresses, and voting records. The attack occurred during the lead-up to the upcoming midterm elections, highlighting the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks and the need for increased vigilance in protecting election infrastructure.\n\nBob Lord, the chief security officer for the DNC, expressed concern about the attack, stating that it serves as further evidence of ongoing threats to the party's electoral process. The attack on the voter file, which is considered the party's most sensitive information, underscores the vulnerability of many systems to manipulation, including those in the 50 states and the inner workings of the parties themselves.\n\nRob Joyce, the White House cybersecurity coordinator until his position was eliminated a few months ago, emphasized the importance of the cyber age changing elections forever. He highlighted the shift from traditional methods of stealing secrets to more sophisticated attempts to manipulate voters through social media and other digital channels. The FBI's detection of the simulated phishing test, which was created to mimic the access page used by Democratic Party officials and campaigns, suggests that the attackers were attempting to trick individuals into providing their login credentials.\n\nThe DNC and the two companies involved in detecting the operation, Cloud Service Provider and a security research firm, claim that they successfully thwarted the potential attack. The fake login page was designed to appear legitimate, with a login prompt asking users to enter their username and password. However, the real login page was hidden within the URL, making it difficult for the attackers to access the actual data.\n\nThe attack on the DNC highlights the need for increased awareness and preparedness among political groups and government organizations to protect against cyber threats. The FBI's investigation emphasizes the importance of maintaining robust cybersecurity measures, including regular software updates, employee training, and the implementation of multi-factor authentication, to safeguard against potential attacks.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee serves as a reminder of the evolving nature of cyber threats and the urgent need for improved cybersecurity practices. The FBI's investigation and the subsequent detection of the simulated phishing test highlight the potential for foreign and domestic actors to exploit vulnerabilities in election infrastructure to manipulate voters and disrupt the democratic process.

The study, conducted by the University of Washington-Seattle's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, provides the most comprehensive analysis of obesity trends over the past few decades, revealing that obesity rates have risen significantly across various countries, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands. The study highlights the following key findings:\n\n1. Obesity prevalence: The number of overweight or obese individuals worldwide increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013, representing a 30% increase in the global population.\n2. Obesity rates by region: Obesity rates are highest in the Middle East and North Africa, with more than 58% of adult men and 65% of adult women overweight or obese. Other regions experiencing significant obesity rates include Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain.\n3. Obesity trends among different age groups: Obesity rates have been rising among both adults and children, with the highest rates observed in the Middle East and North Africa, followed by the Pacific and Caribbean islands, and then in the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia.\n4. Causes of obesity: The study identifies several factors contributing to obesity, including increased calorie intake, changes in diet composition, decreased physical activity, and shifts in the balance of bacteria living in human gut environments.\n5. Economic impact: Obesity is a significant public health concern, leading to chronic complications such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers. In addition, obesity is a major risk factor for premature death, with an estimated 3.4 million deaths annually.\n6. Rising obesity rates in developing countries: Despite efforts to address obesity in wealthy countries like the United States, the majority of the world's obese population resides in developing countries, where obesity rates are accelerating. These countries face unique challenges, including limited access to healthy foods, sedentary lifestyles, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure.\n7. Challenges in reducing obesity rates: The study underscores the need for a multifaceted approach to tackle obesity, including addressing the root causes of obesity, promoting healthier diets, increasing physical activity, and improving access to healthcare services in low-income communities.\n8.

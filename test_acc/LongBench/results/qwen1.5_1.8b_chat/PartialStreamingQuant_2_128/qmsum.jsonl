By grouping the audio signals, the professor believes that it's essential to consider the context of the data and the potential impact on the overall system. The clustering process aims to focus on the most discriminative features and their corresponding targets, which can be used to enhance the robustness of the system against noise and interference. The clustering process involves selecting the appropriate number of clusters, determining the optimal number of clusters, and ensuring that the resulting clusters are representative of the features that indicate the presence of the desired signal characteristics.\nIn summary, the clustering process aims to identify the most relevant features and align them with the target of removing noise and improving the system's robustness. The clustering process focuses on the following aspects:\n\n1. Identifying the most informative features: The clustering process aims to group the audio signals based on their unique characteristics, such as pitch, intonation, and duration, to determine the most relevant features for the system. These features are likely to be the ones that are most indicative of the speech content and the speaker's voice, which can be used to represent the speech signal. The clustering process aims to remove the noise and isolate the speech signal, focusing on the features that are related to the speech content. The clustering process aims to identify the speech-related features, such as pitch, duration, and intensity, to ensure the speech is properly recognized and removed from the audio signal. The clustering process aims to remove the noise and focus on the speech features, allowing the system to better capture the essence of the speech signal.

Kalashnikov, born in 1925 in Russia, developed the rifle during World War II, which saw the Red Army's severe shortage of weapons. After the war, Kalashnikov became disillusioned with the Soviet government's policies and began working on a more efficient and effective military solution. He eventually founded the Kalashnikov Design Bureau, where he worked on developing the AK-47, a versatile and adaptable firearm that revolutionized the battlefield.\n\nKalashnikov's letter to the Russian Orthodox Church, dated May 2012, expresses his deep regret and moral responsibility for the deaths of millions of people due to the AK-47's widespread use. In the letter, Kalashnikov writes that he feels a sense of guilt for the lives lost because of his creation, even though he was a Christian and an Orthodox believer. He explains that his spiritual pain is unbearable and that he keeps asking himself the same question: \"if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\"\n\nThe letter is handwritten on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper and is signed with a wavering hand. It is reproduced by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, and contains detailed information about Kalashnikov's background, his involvement in the development of the AK-47, and his thoughts on the morality of his invention. The letter also mentions Kalashnikov's baptism and his attendance at celebrations marking his 90th birthday at the Kremlin in Moscow.\n\nThe article highlights Kalashnikov's contributions to the development of the AK-47, particularly its durability, versatility, and effectiveness in combat situations. The rifle quickly gained popularity among armed groups and became a symbol of resistance against Soviet rule. Despite his reputation as a military genius, Kalashnikov's actions were met with criticism from some quarters, who accused him of prioritizing profits over human life.\n\nThe article also touches on Kalashnikov's relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church, which played a significant role in his decision to create the AK-47. Kalashnikov initially rejected responsibility for the deaths caused by the rifle, attributing them to the policies of other countries acquiring it. However, his guilt and remorse led him to seek forgiveness from the Church, which ultimately granted him a reply", "answers": ["In our own obituary of AK-47 inventor Mikhail Kalashnikov last month, we included this quote: The rifle was invented \"for the protection of the Motherland,\" he said. \"I have no regrets and bear no responsibility for how politicians have used it.\" It turns out \"no regrets\" might not have exactly been true. The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

McCullough was convicted in the 1957 abduction and killing of Maria Ridulph, a 7-year-old schoolgirl from Sycamore, Illinois. The case was widely publicized in the 1950s due to its age and lack of physical evidence tying McCullough to the crime. However, a new trial was ordered by a judge in Sycamore, Illinois, after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. The hearing was presided over by Judge William P. Brady, who ruled that McCullough should be released and granted him a new trial. McCullough's lawyers and DeKalb County state's attorney Richard Schmack argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. Schmack concluded that he'd found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough had been convicted of a crime he didn't commit. The exact time of Maria's abduction has been in dispute almost from the beginning, with some sources placing her between 6:45 and 7 p.m. on December 3, 1957, while others say she was taken that day some time between 6:45 and 7 p.m. McCullough's defense team argued that the evidence used to convict him was insufficient, including newly discovered phone records that showed a collect call had been placed at 6:57 p.m. to McCullough's home in Sycamore from a pay phone at the post office in downtown Rockford on December 3, 1957, just as McCullough claimed he had done.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

Since January 1, 2016, the CDC has confirmed 50 cases of AFM in 24 states, compared to just 21 cases in 2015. The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it is believed to be related to viral infections, including enteroviruses, which are common and can cause mild illnesses in children. When enteroviruses enter the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain, leading to paralysis. The symptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The best way to prevent AFM is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM. The incidence of AFM has increased significantly since 2014, coinciding with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68. The CDC has issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing. As of November 13, 2014, 88 cases had been reported in 32 states, with a median age of 7.6 years and 54% of cases being males.

{"pred": "The Shroud of Turin, a centuries-old artifact believed to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, has been subjected to a new forensic investigation by researchers who claim it contains inconsistencies in its bloodstain pattern. The shroud, which is currently displayed in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, has been radiocarbon dated to between 1260 and 1390 CE, making it a likely candidate for the crucifixion of Jesus. The researchers, led by Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, used real and synthetic blood samples to analyze the bloodstains on the left-hand side of the cloth, comparing them to the images of a standing model versus a crucified man or a face-down corpse. The results showed that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any single pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprints the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The investigators also tested the flow of blood on the left-hand side of the cloth, finding that the bloodstains appeared to be a mess, with trickles on the back of the hand and flow along the arm occurring at two completely different angles. The researchers concluded that the bloodstains are not consistent with any single pose, indicating that the shroud may be a medieval fraud. The findings raise questions about the authenticity of the shroud and the possibility that it may be an artistic or didactic representation from the XIV century. The investigation has sparked renewed interest in forensic techniques and the potential use of these methods to investigate the authenticity of historical artifacts like the Shroud of Turin.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The first article reports on a lawsuit filed by Anthony Rapp, an actor on the television series \"House of Cards,\" alleging that Spacey made inappropriate sexual advances towards him when he was only 14 years old. Rapp claims that Spacey touched him inappropriately and made advances towards him in a London hotel in 1986. Spacey denied the allegations and apologized for his behavior, stating that he didn't remember the encounter but acknowledged that he was gay for the first time in public. The second article focuses on the accusers themselves, including five men who say they were teenagers at the time and were sexually harassed, assaulted, or attempted to rape by Spacey. These men include Roberto Cavazos, Daniel Beal, Justin Dawes, Harry Dreyfuss, and Kris Nixon. They describe incidents that occurred between 1986 and 2010, including Spacey's sexual advances, unwanted touching, and attempts to force them to engage in sexual activity. The third article discusses the ongoing controversy surrounding Kevin Spacey, who was recently accused of sexual misconduct by multiple accusers. The article includes details about the latest allegations, including Spacey's involvement in the film \"All the Money in the World,\" where he will be replaced by Christopher Plummer. The article also mentions that the film studio, Sony, is supporting Spacey's decision to be removed from the project, and that the decision was made by director Ridley Scott. The fourth article covers the reactions of the public and media to the allegations, with many expressing shock and disappointment at Spacey's behavior. Some journalists have criticized Spacey for attempting to distract attention away from his true nature as a sexual predator, while others have praised his apology and expressed support for the accusers.

The Lumos mission is to shine a light on the lives of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination, and to advocate for policies that prioritize family-based care alternatives.\n\nLumos' work has led to the establishment of a network of over 270 children's institutions across various countries, including Moldova, Bulgaria, and the Czech Republic. The organization estimates that by 2050, the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally, making it a solvable problem based on investments in inclusive education, healthcare, and fostering, adoption, or family-based care alternatives. The success of Lumos in reducing the number of children in institutions in these countries demonstrates the effectiveness of their approach and the potential for widespread change.\n\nIn addition to its work in closing child institutions, Lumos also focuses on raising awareness about the harmful and unnecessary practice of institutionalization through social media campaigns like #Letstalklumos. The campaign encourages individuals to share stories and experiences of children in institutions and to advocate for policy changes that prioritize family-based care. By leveraging the power of social media, Lumos hopes to create a global movement that raises awareness about the issue and inspires action towards ending institutionalization.\n\nThe Internet Archive's contribution to the preservation and accessibility of online content has had a significant impact on the understanding and treatment of children in institutions.

The Malaysian police chief announced that the substance was detected on Kim's eyes and face, and a preliminary analysis from the country's Chemistry Department revealed that VX was present. The Malaysian toxicology report indicates that Kim was attacked using VX nerve agent, which is highly potent and can cause immediate death in minutes. The police chief stated that the presence of the nerve agent had been detected in swabs taken from Kim's eyes and face, and one of the women involved in the attack was later sickened and suffered from vomiting. The Malaysian authorities have arrested four people, including one North Korean and the two women he interacted with at the airport, and seven North Koreans are currently being sought, including a diplomat. The incident has sparked a diplomatic crisis between Malaysia and North Korea, with Malaysia accusing the North of orchestrating the attack and North Korea denouncing the investigation as full of \"holes and contradictions.\" The Malaysian government plans to decontaminate the airport and areas the suspects are known to have visited, while the North has vowed to respond with force if Malaysia takes further action.

The movie is set in the 1890s in the fictional hamlet of Blackmoor, England, and follows Lawrence Talbot, a traveling actor returning to his ancestral manse to bury his brother and confront the family demons.

The dinosaur, which lived 160 million years ago, possessed iridescent feathers that resemble those of modern hummingbirds. The feathers were well-preserved on a nearly complete skeleton, revealing intricate structures such as platelet-like nanostructures and the presence of melanosomes within the feathers. The researchers analyzed the feathers using a combination of scanning electron microscopy and discriminant function analysis, identifying the iridescent colors as blue, pink, and purple.

The researchers speculate that the iridescent feathers may have served as a social or sexual cue, attracting mates or marking individuals for dominance. The discovery challenges previous assumptions about the evolution of feathers in birds, as it suggests that feathers initially evolved for display and later developed the necessary traits for flight. The study provides insights into the development of iridescent feathers in small raptor dinosaurs before the emergence of birds, highlighting the importance of the role of feathers in communication and display.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\" It wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously.

They descended the mountain's west face using Mr Wilson's phone, crossing the unstable cliffs and encountering numerous obstacles along the way. As they approached the summit, Mrs Wilson fell 30 feet (9 meters) down a vertical cliff, resulting in severe injuries. The coroner concluded that Mrs Wilson's accidental death was due to the change in route taken to avoid the summit, which involved descending the western face instead of retracing the same path. The incident highlights the importance of carrying a paper copy of the place being explored and the potential dangers associated with relying solely on electronic navigation aids. The Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team was called upon to respond to the emergency, leading to the discovery of Mrs Wilson's body over 150 meters below. The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death, emphasizing the need for caution and proper planning when engaging in outdoor activities. The article also mentions that Mrs Wilson had been a fit and active woman who had been mountain walking and scrambling for six years, and that her husband had been using an Ordnance Survey app on his smartphone.

{"pred": "Seattle's new sugary drink tax, which was introduced in 2018, has had a significant impact on the city's economy and residents' purchasing habits. The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold, making it more expensive for consumers. The tax applies to soda, sports drinks, kombucha, and other sugary beverages that don't list milk as their first ingredient. The tax has resulted in a 34% decrease in sales of beverages affected by the tax in Costco stores, and a 38% increase in sales of sweetened beverages in its nine stores just outside Cook County. The tax has also led to concerns among retailers and restaurants, who fear that it will drive sales away from the city and negatively impact their profits. The tax has also triggered numerous lawsuits, including a lawsuit against the county to get the tax thrown out days before it was to take effect. Despite the backlash, the beverage industry has supported the tax, arguing that it helps combat obesity and diabetes and drives down health care costs. However, some residents and businesses are concerned that the tax disproportionately affects low-income families and that it leaves out sugar-heavy beverages like those sold at Starbucks. The tax has also been criticized for being poorly designed and confusing, with some retailers misapplying the tax on purchases made with federal food stamp benefits. The tax has also been challenged by groups like the American Heart Association, the Illinois Public Health Institute, and the World Health Organization, who argue that it is necessary to address the issue of obesity and diabetes.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

However, Senate Democrats have rejected any changes to the health law, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any bill that includes the repeal. The Senate is scheduled to reconvene on Monday afternoon, but the impasse is likely to persist until the deadline, causing significant economic and social impacts on the US. The potential shutdown could result in job losses, reduced access to healthcare, and a disruption in various sectors, including education, transportation, and public safety. Local governments have been preparing for the potential shutdown by setting aside funds in anticipation of lost income tax revenue from idled federal workers. The US government is currently considering a $986-billion spending bill to fund the ACA, but negotiations are ongoing, and a partial government shutdown is likely to occur if the bill fails to pass.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports.

Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The Parker Solar Probe, named after Parker, will be launched in July 2018 and aim to study the sun's atmosphere, particularly the solar wind, and its impact on the Earth's magnetic field. The spacecraft will travel to within 4 million miles of the sun's surface, the closest point to the sun, during its seven-year mission. The Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from the intense heat and radiation of the sun. The spacecraft will also have a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to keep the science instruments at room temperature. The mission aims to trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona, understand the heating of the solar corona and the mechanisms that accelerate the solar wind, and study the solar wind's origins. The Parker Solar Probe will also investigate the origins of solar wind, including the mysterious heating of the sun's atmosphere and how the solar wind accelerates to supersonic speeds of up to 400 miles per second. The mission will provide unprecedented insights into the physics of the sun, including the solar wind, and help scientists understand the mechanisms that drive it. The Parker Solar Probe will also study the solar wind's impact on the Earth's magnetic field, which is essential for maintaining the stability of the global power grid. The mission will also examine the impact of space weather on the power grid, including the possibility of long-term power outages and the potential for geomagnetic storms.

The malware triggered a \"hook\" that started sucking up information on transactions in the memory of the POS system or the server that controlled it. This allowed the attackers to steal credit and debit card data without requiring physical access to the stores. The attack was carried out by criminal groups in Eastern Europe, using software coding proficiency to create the malware. The report from iSight, a computer firm hired to investigate the breach, detailed the type of software used, the effectiveness of the attack, and the regions where software capabilities exist to create the malware. The report concluded that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cybercrooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach.

{"pred": "The discovery of Planet Nine, a potentially massive icy planet located beyond Pluto, has generated excitement among astronomers and space enthusiasts alike. The new planet, estimated to be between five and ten times the mass of Earth, orbits beyond Neptune's path and has not been directly observed. The researchers behind the discovery, Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have used mathematical and computer modeling to establish its existence based on the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. They predict that Planet Nine could have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational forces of Jupiter or Saturn, and its existence challenges the traditional definition of a planet as a celestial body that has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked debates about Pluto's status, with some arguing for its reinstatement as a planet and others advocating for its demotion. However, Prof. Mike Brown, the \"Pluto killer,\" maintains that the IAU should not classify Pluto as a planet due to its misclassification in 2006. He believes that Pluto's demotion is necessary for the good of science, as it allows for the consideration of the candidacies of hundreds, possibly thousands of wannabe planets. Prof. Brown's views on Pluto's demotion have been widely shared on social media, with many scientists expressing support for the decision.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Pluto's demotion, the discovery of Planet Nine has reignited interest in the outer solar system and has provided valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system. The discovery has also highlighted the importance of studying small, icy objects in the outer solar system, as they play a crucial role in shaping the orbits of other planets and determining the structure of the solar system.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of Planet Nine represents a significant milestone in the ongoing search for new planets in our solar system. While the debate over Pluto's status remains contentious, the new planet's existence challenges the traditional definition of a planet and provides valuable insights into the origins of the solar system. Prof. Mike Brown's stance on Pluto's demotion highlights the importance of considering the candidacies of potential candidates for planet status and the need for continued research into the inner workings of the solar system.

The study involved 9,509 men and women with stable CAD, monitoring their weight over an average of 12 visits. The median body weight variation over the period was 3.8 pounds per visit, and the researchers adjusted for various risk factors before comparing the weight variability of the two groups: those with the lowest weight variability (one-fifth) and those with the highest.\n\nThe study found that individuals with the highest weight variability had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability. The researchers attributed this difference to the fact that the one-fifth with the highest weight variability had a significantly larger body fat mass, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases.\n\nYo-yo dieting refers to the repeated cycles of weight loss and weight gain, often accompanied by periods of rapid weight fluctuations. Previous studies have shown that yo-yo dieting may have negative health implications for individuals with CAD, including an increased risk of poor heart health, heart attacks, stroke, and death. However, the new study adds to this evidence by demonstrating that yo-yo dieting may have even more severe health consequences for people with CAD who have experienced large fluctuations in weight over an extended period.\n\nTo prevent and treat CAD, a healthy lifestyle is crucial. The study highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. The researchers recommend that individuals with CAD engage in regular physical activity, maintain a healthy weight, and limit their intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and sodium. They also emphasize the role of gut microbiota in the development of CAD and suggest investigating potential mechanisms underlying weight fluctuations in individuals with CAD.\n\nThe study raises concerns about the long-term effects of yo-yo dieting on CAD patients, particularly those who are already at high risk due to CAD.

This is a significant shift from the traditional view that colorectal cancer is primarily associated with older men. The study estimates that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively. According to the study, younger patients tend to have more aggressive treatments, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, compared to older patients. The study also found that younger patients with tumors that have metastasized, or reached other organs, were more likely to get more aggressive treatments. The study lacks data on family history and other risk factors for colorectal cancers, and it's unclear whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths. The study recommends that doctors should be on the lookout for warning signs of colon cancer, such as bright red bleeding with a bowel movement, and that people with a family history of colon cancer and others at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50. The study highlights the importance of considering the unique characteristics of younger patients when determining appropriate screening guidelines, and it calls for further research to determine the optimal age for screening. The study's findings raise concerns about the impact of smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet on the development of colorectal cancer in younger adults.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The site, known as Warratyi, is the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in the world, descended from the first people to leave Africa. The archaeologists found artefacts and fossils from the site, including burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre, and gypsum pigments, indicating the development of local technologies. The oldest known artefact found in Australia is a tiny axe fragment dated to 44,000 years ago, but radiocarbon dating of burnt eggshells reveals them to be between 45,000 and 49,000 years old. The discovery challenges the assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world. The Warratyi site is located about 550 kilometers north of Adelaide and contains the first reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the fossil remains of a giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and an ancient giant bird. The site also provides evidence of hafted axe technology, which was developed as a local innovation. The discovery is significant because it challenges the Eurocentric view that material culture in Australia is quite simplistic and backward. The Warratyi site is the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth, and the date of the settlement places it in the context of early human migration into the arid interior of Australia.

The film \"Detroit\" directed by Kathryn Bigelow, a former spouse of James Cameron, is a well-made and evocative portrayal of the event, but it lacks the perspective and illumination that one might hope a 50-year-old event would warrant. The film is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"strong violence and pervasive language.\" The movie follows the story of three young Black men who were killed during a police siege at the Motiv City's Algiers Motel, where racism met frustration and blood was wantonly shed. The mostly white Detroit Police Department emerged officially exonerated but not blameless, but the color of a person's skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police, who were recently encouraged by President Donald Trump to \"please don't be too nice\" when dealing with crime suspects, wink, wink. The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on, making Detroit urgent viewing regardless of its character-development flaws. The film is not a character study and more of a situational one; a post-script notes that the Algiers Motel incident has never been fully explained. The movie portrays the police as ruthless and violent, and the victims as innocent and defenseless. The film's depiction of the police's actions and the impact of racism on the community is disturbing and powerful, and it raises important questions about the role of law enforcement and the treatment of marginalized groups in society.

{"pred": "The three-step process for dominating the universe involves harvesting all of a planet's resources, all of a nearby star's energy, and all the energy from all the stars in a local galaxy. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev first proposed these three phases of galactic expansion in 1962 as a way to measure the energy consumption of increasingly powerful societies. A recent paper posted on the preprint journal arXiv.org has revived Kardashev's model and added a new, apocalyptic twist, suggesting that any sufficiently advanced civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will expand throughout the universe, attempting to secure as many stars as possible before they become permanently inaccessible due to the encroaching horizon caused by dark energy. To capture stars from other galaxies, scientists propose using a swarm of satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" which would create a spherical shell around a star and harness its energy. The satellites would be made of satellites, such as solar-powered ones, and would be capable of maintaining their position in space through gravitational balance. The satellites would not be in orbit, but instead hover in space, forming a \"statite\" ring around the star. The satellite would collect the star's energy and beam it back to the home planet, where it could be harnessed for various purposes, including powering spacecraft and generating electricity. The paper also discusses the possibility of alien civilizations that are thousands, or even millions, of years older than humanity, and proposes that they may already be well into their Level III, star-harvesting phase. These civilizations would be of three types: a Type I civilization that harnesses all the resources of a planet, a Type II civilization that harnesses all the radiation of a star, and a Type III civilization that harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. The proposed Dyson spheres and other mega-structures appear frequently in science fiction, and the top 10 mad scientists, most famous astronomers of all time, and top 10 star trek technologies are mentioned in the article.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The show was created by Jon Stewart, who served as the host from 1999 to 2003, and was initially intended to be a successor to Craig Kilborn's show. The show's format was unique, featuring a mix of news satire, interviews, and field pieces, with a focus on highlighting the absurdities and inconsistencies in mainstream news coverage. The article highlights several key milestones in the show's development, including:\n\n1. The launch of The Daily Show in 1996, which marked a significant shift in the landscape of late-night programming, as it aimed to challenge the dominance of conservative talk shows and provide a fresh perspective on political issues.\n2. The transition from Kilborn's show to Stewart's in 1999, which led to a change in the show's tone and approach, with a greater emphasis on humor and wit in the jokes and commentary.\n3. The introduction of new correspondents and contributors, including Vance DeGeneres, Mo Rocca, and Stephen Colbert, who brought a diverse range of perspectives and styles to the show.\n4. The development of a team of writers and producers, including James Dixon, Ben Karlin, and David Jaeger, who worked closely with Stewart to refine the show's content and production methods.\n5. The creation of a new field department, which featured a rotating cast of correspondents and field producers, allowing for more frequent and varied content, including interviews with politicians and other notable figures.\n6. The use of satire and parody to comment on current events and political issues, often drawing on the conventions of news reporting and the absurdities of everyday life.\n7. The emergence of a dedicated fan base, particularly among younger male viewers, who appreciated the show's irreverent tone and willingness to push boundaries.\n8. The challenges faced by the show during the tenure of its original writers, including clashes with Kilborn's team and the pressure to maintain a consistent brand image.\n9.

{"pred": "The discovery of ancient Middle Stone Age tools in Kenya, dating back to around 320,000 years ago, provides new insights into the development of early human societies in the region. The oldest tools, consisting mainly of hand axes, were shaped like tear drops with rounded ends and pointed eyes, indicating a focus on cutting and processing plant material. The next technological revolution, marked by the emergence of Middle Stone Age implements, occurred tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought, suggesting that early humans began developing it even earlier than previously thought. The team of international scientists found that the Middle Stone Age tools were made from obsidian that originated from at least 25 to 50 kilometers away from the excavation sites, while the pigment lumps, including two pieces with grinding marks, came from an undetermined distance outside the Olorgesailie vicinity. The team's findings challenge the traditional view that modernity arose outside of Africa and suggest that some hominin groups were already adapting technologically and culturally to cope with the unpredictable changes in food sources and environmental conditions. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools and pigment lumps provides evidence of complex behaviors and social networks among early human societies, highlighting the importance of space and time in shaping human history. The research challenges the traditional distinction between modern humans and archaic humans and suggests that every criterion used to differentiate modern humans from archaic humans has older examples. The study also highlights the gradual complex change that occurred over time, making it more difficult to interpret than the sudden transformation observed in the Middle Stone Age.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

The search area covers an area of approximately 217,000 square kilometers (84,000 square miles), and the Australian Naval Ship Ocean Shield is using a towed pinger locator from the US Navy to detect underwater signals associated with the flight recorders. The signals detected by the Chinese ship, Haixun 01, have a frequency of 37.5 kHz, which matches the frequency emitted by the flight recorders. However, there is currently no evidence linking these signals to the missing plane. The search team is working closely with the Malaysian government and other countries to gather more information and refine their search strategy. The search area has been narrowed down to an estimated 1,700 km (1,000 miles) north-west of Perth, based on analysis of satellite data. The search team is using advanced technologies, including underwater locator capabilities, to track the plane's movements and potential locations. The battery-powered signal on the flight recorders is expected to expire within six to eight days, and the search team is working to ensure that the locator remains operational until then. The race against time is crucial, as the battery-powered signal fades after 30 days, and the search area has been expanded to cover a larger area. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, along with the Chinese and US navies, is leading the search effort, with the assistance of other countries such as Britain, France, and the United States. The search team is hopeful that the signals detected by the Chinese ship will provide valuable insights into the plane's final resting place, but caution is necessary due to the limited information available and the challenges posed by the search environment.

On Saturday, Trump made a statement asserting that his social media use is \"modern-day presidential,\" a claim that has been met with criticism from some Republicans who believe it undermines the dignity of the presidency.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump stated that he did not want to act presidential \"quite yet,\" but he promised that he would become \"so presidential\" in the future. However, his recent tweets have increasingly raised questions about whether he is effectively communicating with the American people and whether he is engaging in incitement to violence.\n\nOn December 28, 2021, Trump shared a GIF of a 2007 WWE incident where he body-slammed and repeatedly punched WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. The GIF that Trump tweeted superimposed the CNN logo on McMahon's head, which led to criticism from CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who called the tweet \"an incitement to violence.\"\n\nSome Republicans have expressed concern about Trump's Twitter habit, arguing that his tweets often attack the media and suggest that he is not acting in the best interests of the country. Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse said that the tweets were \"beneath the dignity\" of the presidential office, while Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski tweeted that \"do you want to be remembered for your tweets or your accomplishments?\"\n\nIn addition to his attacks on the media, Trump has also faced criticism for his tweets regarding COVID-19, including his claims that the virus was created by China and that vaccines were a hoax. These tweets have been widely debunked by medical experts and have contributed to public health concerns.\n\nOverall, the controversy surrounding Trump's social media use highlights the challenges of balancing the need for effective communication with the demands of the presidency. While some argue that his tweets serve a legitimate purpose in connecting with the American people, others believe that they undermine the integrity of the presidency and contribute to a culture of division and misinformation.

The airline is also launching push notifications for passengers who have the airline's mobile app, which will inform them when boarding has started and give them a tool to manage their boarding group. The new boarding process aims to address overcrowding at gates, which has become an unwelcome side effect of full flights.

However, her parents declined to press charges, and months later, Sizemore returned for reshoots in Malibu. The Hollywood Reporter has learned that the incident took place near the end of production on the film, and the now 26-year-old former actress, whose identity has not been disclosed, declined to address the matter except to note that she's recently hired a lawyer to explore legal action against the actor as well as her parents. Sizemore has denied the allegations, stating that he has never been accused of molestation before. The incident has previously gone unreported, but it comes out now in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment-and-rape scandal, which has set off a cascade of similar allegations and a belated industry move towards openness about such accusations. The producers of the film, who were initially hesitant to dismiss Sizemore due to his reputation, ultimately removed him from the set and filed a complaint with the Screen Actors Guild legal department. The film's casting director, Catrine McGregor, filed a complaint with SAG's legal department and pushed for Sizemore's immediate dismissal from the project.

Cruz was a student with a history of frequent, violent outbursts and was classified as a special education student due to his dyslexia and reading difficulties. Hooper initially warned the school principal about Cruz's behavior, but the situation escalated when Cruz's mother asked for permission to give him stitches when he was 12 years old. Despite opposition from his mother and friends, Hooper decided to adopt Cruz and gave him the name Riojas. Over the next 35 years, Hooper and Cruz grew closer, and Cruz eventually changed his name to Hooper. Cruz's adoption was a turning point in his life, and he became a beloved member of the Hooper family. Cruz's story highlights the importance of compassion, empathy, and the power of love in overcoming adversity and changing lives. Hooper's decision to adopt Cruz was motivated by her belief that he needed a stable home environment and a supportive teacher who would care for him despite his challenging circumstances. The adoption also served as a reminder of the impact that teachers can have on their students' lives, and the importance of creating a safe and nurturing learning environment where students feel valued and supported.

This initiative aims to address the issue of broken links on the web, which can lead to users being unable to access content or experiencing a \"404\" error. The goal is to replace broken links with archived versions of the original pages, ensuring that users have access to the information they were intended to find.\n\nThe Internet Archive has identified a list of \"No More 404\" sites, which are websites that have been removed or significantly altered since their creation. These sites are considered important historical sources and serve as a valuable resource for researchers, educators, and anyone interested in learning about past events or developments. By archiving these pages, the Internet Archive aims to preserve the context and meaning behind them, allowing future generations to understand the significance of the information they contain.\n\nTo achieve this objective, the Internet Archive is conducting crawls of these No More 404 sites. During each crawl, the archive retrieves the HTML code of the website and extracts the relevant information, including the title, description, images, and any other relevant metadata. The extracted data is then stored in a database, along with a timestamp indicating when it was last accessed.\n\nOnce the crawls are complete, the Internet Archive creates a new version of the No More 404 site, replacing the original content with the archived version. This process involves updating the URL, adding a unique identifier to the archived version, and creating a corresponding link on the original site. The new link points to the archived version, providing users with a stable and consistent source of information even if the original site changes or disappears.\n\nIn addition to archiving the No More 404 sites, the Internet Archive also provides a companion link on the original site, allowing users to easily navigate back to the original version. This feature allows users to view the original content without having to search for the archived version, making it easier for them to locate and use the information they need.\n\nOverall, the \"Crawls for History\" project is a significant step towards preserving the history and context of the internet. By archiving pages and providing companion links, the Internet Archive ensures that users have access to accurate and reliable information, even when the original source is no longer available.

The MCA, a law passed in 2006, has reversed the right to habeas corpus for anyone detained at Guantánamo Bay and for any foreigner the government detains anywhere and labels an \"enemy combatant.\" The MCA applies to legal residents of the U.S. as well, meaning someone who has lived in the U.S. for years could potentially be labeled an \"enemy combatant\" and then thrown into prison with no legal recourse to challenge their detention.

The court hearing has been moved back from 6 May to 27 May, and at that time, the judge will hear legal arguments regarding whether Hercules and Leo should remain at Stony Brook.

The company was raided by federal marshals in Tennessee in August 2011, during which they seized a shipment of ebony from Madagascar. The Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals, making it illegal to import illegally harvested wood. However, Gibson has maintained that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law. The company has denied the allegations of trafficking, stating that all of its imports from Madagascar have been legal. The Justice Department has stated that Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband, and it quotes emails that seem to show the company taking steps to maintain a supply chain that's been connected to illegal timber harvests. The company has presented documents to support its claim, and the recent raid seized legally obtained wood from India. The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, has expressed concern over the potential impact of the charges on the company's business and the吉他 industry as a whole. The Justice Department has defended the Lacey Act and its efforts to enforce it, stating that it aims to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that buyers must be asking questions and sourcing wood responsibly. The company's lawyer, Ronald Bienstock, has warned clients to be wary of traveling abroad with old guitars, as the law states that owners can be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The company has also faced criticism for trying to create exemptions to cover vintage instruments, which are rife with delays and to play it safe, it has nearly eliminated the 40% of its business that used to deal with overseas buyers.

The ocean, which is composed of water with a higher proportion of deuterium compared to Earth's ocean, was discovered through a series of measurements of sunlight reflected off the Martian surface and through the atmosphere. The team of scientists led by Geronimo Villanueva, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, calculated the amount of water that the planet has lost over time and found that it was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of about 137 meters. The ocean was likely formed in the northern hemisphere, with a consistently lower altitude than the polar regions. The study provides new evidence for the existence of an ancient ocean on Mars and suggests that it may have provided a hospitable environment for life to exist on the planet. The findings are supported by recent studies that have suggested increased signs of biological activity on Mars, including the detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere. The search for life on Mars will continue in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends its Exomars rover to the red planet, which will aim to detect chemical signatures of life, potentially emanating from microbial life deep beneath the Martian soil.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "The European Court of Justice has ruled that Nestlé, the maker of Kit Kat, does not own the shape of the four-fingered wafer biscuits, despite arguing that it owns the trademark for the same shape. The court found that Mondelez, the American competitor, had validly registered the shape as a trademark in the EU, and that Nestlé's appeal was invalid. This decision means that Kit Kat will lose its EU trademark, but it leaves open the possibility of future challenges to protect the shape in other EU countries. The ruling follows a long-standing legal battle between Nestlé and Mondelez over the shape of the Kit Kat wafer, which dates back to 2002. The case was initially decided by a lower EU court in 2016, which found that Nestlé did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the shape was distinctive across the EU. However, the court overturned that decision and ordered Nestlé to reevaluate its trademark application based on new evidence. The ruling has implications for巧克力 manufacturers operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. It also highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the ownership of trademarks in the UK, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat first marketed by Rowntree's, which was bought by the Swiss in 1988.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision.

The decision comes after a 14-year effort by Vanderbilt to rename Confederate Memorial Hall, which has been inscribed with the name since it opened in 1935. The university has also made other efforts to address diversity, including the addition of a chief diversity officer to its leadership team and the renaming of the residence hall to Memorial Hall in 2005. The decision to remove the Confederate name from the building reflects the university's commitment to addressing racism and slavery on its campus, and is seen as a positive step towards becoming an institution that values diversity and inclusivity.

However, the latest merger presents fewer regulatory challenges due to ICE's focus on commodities, which are less attractive to investors compared to stocks.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to lead to increased efficiency and cost savings for both companies, as they streamline their operations and reduce duplication. The merged entity would have access to a larger customer base, enabling it to offer a wider range of products and services to clients. The integration of ICE's electronic trading platform, known as Arca, would further enhance the competitiveness of the combined entity, allowing it to compete with other exchanges that have embraced digitalization.\n\nThe potential merger also marks a shift towards electronic trading, which has gained momentum in recent years, as exchanges seek to leverage technology to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, have developed a computer model that uses functional MRI to reconstruct YouTube videos from viewers' brain activity.

In June 2009, the plane went missing flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, and debris from the Airbus A330 was found floating on the surface of the Atlantic five days later. However, the mystery of why the plane crashed could only be answered by finding the black box and the cockpit voice recorder. The search for the plane was conducted by American, Brazilian, and French ships, planes, and submarines, but they couldn't find it. In 2011, a team of French government investigators working on the Air France hunt located the wreckage, and they believe that a deliberate act caused the disappearance. The team used Bayesian statistics named after a British Presbyterian minister called Thomas Bayes to analyze the data and assess the likelihood of different scenarios. The team split up the search area into a grid and applied a probability map to each cell, taking into account the likelihood of the plane being found in each location. The team adjusted the probability map based on new information, such as the flight path, wind, ocean flow, and which areas had been searched already. The team also considered the likelihood of the plane crashing due to mechanical failures, historical crashes, and the presence of the black box and voice recorder. The team concluded that the probability of the plane being found in locations that had already been searched was low, and they revised their model accordingly.

Durst was arrested in March 2015 following a search of his hotel room in downtown New Orleans, where he was found with a loaded Smith and Wesson .38-caliber revolver. The gun charge stems from a search of Durst's room on March 14, 2015, which turned up a flesh-colored latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair, five ounces of marijuana, more than $100,000 in cash, and a loaded Smith and Wesson .38-caliber revolver. Durst maintains his innocence and has repeatedly stated that he is not guilty of killing Susan Berman. Durst's defense team requested that he be sent to a low-security federal prison facility in California, where he would face a murder trial in Berman's death. However, U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt approved a plea agreement for Durst to serve about 7 years, 1 month in prison on a weapons charge. Durst still faces a separate murder charge in California, which he is accused of killing in 2000.

Durst's guilty plea in February to a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, stemming from a search of his hotel room, was accepted as part of a plea agreement for him to serve his time at a low-security federal prison facility while he awaits state prosecution for Berman's murder. Durst's defense team believes that Los Angeles prosecutors have not revealed any new evidence in the case, but they are confident that Durst will beat the murder rap. The renewed interest in Durst for Berman's killing stems from the conclusion of the HBO show \"The Jinx,\" which chronicled several police investigations of the multimillionaire's family and his involvement in the murder of his friend Susan Berman.

However, the report contradicts the claims made by the Obama administration, which initially believed that the attack was a response to a protest. The second article outlines the timeline of events leading up to the attack, highlighting the differing statements made by Secretary Clinton and other officials regarding the incident. The third article discusses the criticisms of the Select Committee's report, particularly the claim that the attack was a terrorist attack organized by Iran or al-Qaeda.

The defense attorney, Doug Ramseur, successfully challenged the search warrant in court, arguing that the search dog's findings were inconsistent with witness accounts and video surveillance evidence, that detectives might have misled a magistrate to obtain the warrant, and that there was not probable cause for police to conduct those searches. However, Albemarle County Circuit Judge Cheryl Higgins ruled there were no \"instances of deliberate misstatements and reckless disregard\" of the truth in the affidavit supporting the search warrant and, although the dog's findings may have had inconsistencies, there were other arguments in the six-page affidavit that could constitute probable cause.

Egeland, who was convicted of mortgage fraud in 2014, had his sentence extended by three years and 10 months, bringing his total prison term to ten years. The extension was based on Egeland's guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the elaborate insurance scam, and for interstate failure to pay child support. Egeland had arranged for his son, Rylan Egeland, to shoot him in the leg with a shotgun on July 31, 2014, hoping to delay his prison sentence and benefit from a fraudulent disability insurance policy he had applied for seven days earlier. However, the son accidentally shot Egeland in his lower legs and left the scene. Egeland called 911 and claimed he was a victim of assault when he stopped to help a pregnant motorist. He told authorities he was suddenly hit in the head and shot along the side of the road. Egeland previously had pleaded guilty to fraud charges for his role in the Desert Sun housing scandal that rocked Central Oregon in 2009.

The extension was allowed by a judge due to Egeland's self-surrender to prison and the fact that the fraud was quickly detected. Egeland had his left leg amputated as a result of the gunshot, and he received an additional three years and 10 months in jail. The court emphasized the psychological and emotional damage Egeland caused to his son and the impact it had on his family. Egeland's lawyer argued for a two-year sentence to be served consecutively to the 10-year sentence he is currently serving, arguing that the additional time would allow him to receive mental health treatment and counseling while in prison. The judge agreed with this recommendation, ordering Egeland to pay $90,011 in child support and to undergo a new mental health evaluation when he gets out of custody.

The latest report by the University of Washington-Seattle's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation provides a comprehensive overview of one of the pressing public health dilemmas of our time, using data covering 188 nations from 1980 to 2013. The report shows that obesity rates are rising in all parts of the world, with the highest rates occurring in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands. The biggest obesity rises among women came in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain, while men were found to be more affected in New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. The report also highlights the impact of obesity on various health risks, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and chronic complications of weight loss. The study finds that obesity is a complex problem that is affecting people of all ages, incomes, and regions, with not one country successfully reducing its obesity rate. The problem is particularly acute in the Middle East and North Africa, where more than 58% of adult men and 65% of adult women are overweight or obese. The report suggests that obesity is appearing at increasing young ages, rising nearly 50 percent in children and adolescents worldwide, and that more than half of the world's obese live in just 10 countries: the United States, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Germany, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The report concludes that obesity is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality, and that urgent action is needed to address this global public health crisis.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

The party's victory marks a significant shift in the political landscape, as the Brotherhood has gained control of the upper house of parliament, which traditionally has been dominated by the conservative National Democratic Party (NDP). The Brotherhood's success comes despite ongoing legal challenges against its leader, former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who faces corruption and conspiracy charges. The prosecution argues that Mubarak was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the 18-day uprising that forced him out of office in February 2011. The trial of Mubarak resumes on Tuesday, with the prosecution presenting its case against the former president and 10 others, including his two sons, his security chief, and a close associate of the ousted leader who is now a fugitive. The trial has been plagued by procedural issues, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding Judge Ahmed Rifaat be removed. If convicted, Mubarak could face the death penalty if he is found guilty of complicity in the killings of protesters.

{"pred": "The Occupy Movement in Los Angeles has faced a series of challenges and setbacks since its inception in September 2011. On November 27, 2011, the Los Angeles Police Department declared an unlawful assembly on the streets surrounding City Hall and ordered the protesters to immediately disperse or face arrest. Despite the initial deadline of midnight, the protesters refused to comply, leading to a tense standoff with police. However, after a 4 a.m. deadline passed, the police commanders decided to allow the encampment to stay until at least daybreak. The Los Angeles encampment, which had grown to roughly 400 tents and 700 to 800 people, organizers and municipal officials said, was among the largest on the West Coast aligned with a 2-month-old national Occupy Wall Street movement protesting economic inequality and excesses of the U.S. financial system. The encampment had been tolerated by the city for weeks, despite other cities moving in to clear out similar camps. On Sunday night, the size of the crowd outside City Hall swelled further as supporters from organized labor, clergy, civil rights, and other groups streamed into the area, answering a call for an 11th-hour show of support. The overall number of protesters, some wearing gas masks, had grown to at least 2,000 by late Sunday, police estimated. The police began to make their presence known as the mayor's eviction deadline passed, and the protesters' mood turned from calm and festive to rowdy. Demonstrators and police confronted each other overnight but except for some debris thrown by protesters at one point, there was no violence. One skirmish involved an intersection occupied by protesters. The Los Angeles Police Department has been relatively accommodating to its Occupy group compared to other major cities, with Villaraigosa at one point providing ponchos to campers when it rained. However, after the collapse of negotiations aimed at persuading protesters to relocate voluntarily, the mayor said last week the encampment would have to go. The mayor complimented the protesters on Sunday for staying peaceful, but he added in a statement: \"It is time for Occupy LA to move from focusing their efforts to hold a particular patch of park land to spreading the message of economic justice and restoration of balance to American society.\" The Los Angeles encampment has been a significant symbol of the ongoing struggle for social and economic justice in the United States, and its future remains uncertain.", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park. Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse. But as of last night, a police inspector said they didn't intend to forcibly evict anyone. \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Confrontation is never good.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2099}
{"pred": "The article discusses the life and legacy of Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the iconic AK-47 assault rifle. Kalashnikov, born in 1925 in Ukraine, developed the rifle during World War II, which saw the Red Army's severe shortage of weapons. After the war, Kalashnikov became disillusioned with the Soviet government's policies and began working on a more efficient and effective military solution. He eventually founded the Kalashnikov Design Bureau, where he worked on developing the AK-47, a simple yet deadly weapon that revolutionized the battlefield.\n\nKalashnikov's letter to the Russian Orthodox Church, dated May 2012, expresses his deep regret for the deaths caused by the AK-47. He writes that he feels morally responsible for the countless lives lost due to the weapon's ability to take down enemy soldiers quickly and efficiently. Despite his guilt, Kalashnikov maintains that he did not seek to create a weapon for evil purposes, but rather to defend his country and its citizens.\n\nThe letter also sheds light on Kalashnikov's personal beliefs and values. He was raised as a Christian and an Orthodox believer, and his faith played a significant role in shaping his设计理念. Kalashnikov believed that weapons should serve a higher purpose, such as protecting the Fatherland and defending innocent civilians. He saw the AK-47 as a tool for self-defense and national defense, rather than a means of mass murder.\n\nDespite his guilt, Kalashnikov's legacy continues to inspire and influence modern military technology. The AK-47 remains a symbol of military innovation and efficiency, and its impact on the global arms market cannot be overstated. Today, the AK-47 is produced and distributed by numerous manufacturers around the world, serving as a versatile and effective weapon in various conflicts and applications.\n\nHowever, the AK-47's association with child soldiers and the use of violence against innocent civilians has led to criticism and controversy. Kalashnikov's decision to develop the rifle for military use, despite concerns about its potential misuse, has sparked debates about the ethics of weapon development and the role of governments in regulating military equipment.\n\nOverall, the article highlights the complex relationship between Kalashnikov's设计理念, personal beliefs, and the historical context surrounding the creation of the AK-47. It underscores the enduring impact of Kalashnikov's work on military technology and the ongoing debate about the ethical implications of weapon development.", "answers": ["In our own obituary of AK-47 inventor Mikhail Kalashnikov last month, we included this quote: The rifle was invented \"for the protection of the Motherland,\" he said. \"I have no regrets and bear no responsibility for how politicians have used it.\" It turns out \"no regrets\" might not have exactly been true. The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

McCullough was sentenced to life in prison in 2012, but a new trial was ordered in 2013 by another judge. During the trial, McCullough maintained his claim that he was not the one who abducted and killed Maria, stating that he was 40 miles away in Rockford, Illinois, talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force when she was taken. However, the defense team presented evidence that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi.

The first study, led by Dr. Laura E.

The study tested two groups of MRSA, one exposed to cigarette smoke extract and one not, to determine the impact of cigarette smoke on the bacteria's cell walls and immune defenses. The results showed that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA, indicating that cigarette smoke exposure alters the bacteria's cell wall to enhance survival against reactive oxygen species, which are generated by macrophages to kill pathogens. Additionally, the study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became more resistant antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls and contribute to the development of pneumonia in mice.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The cause of AFM is still unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections like polio and non-polio enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Enteroviruses are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children, such as respiratory infections or even summer colds. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. The symptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, or slurred speech. The best prevention is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM. The illness seems to peak in 2014, with 120 cases reported between August and December - all children. The average age for children stricken with AFM is 7 and many had to be placed on respirators.

The shroud, which has been revered by some Christians as an icon, was analyzed using radiocarbon dating to determine its origins to be between 1260 and 1390 CE. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse, adding to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The investigation involved the use of real and synthetic blood samples on cloth to test the orientation of stains on the better-defined left side of the cloth (they also compared the two liquids to see if they flowed the same way). The researchers found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. If it were a death shroud of a bleeding, executed person, hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, Borrini said, \"the bloodstains shouldn't be so inconsistent.\" The inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns indicate that the shroud may not be a genuine historical artifact, but rather a medieval artwork or \"didactic\" representation from the XIV century.

This decision was met with widespread opposition from shareholders, who rejected the pay package, arguing that it was excessive and did not reflect the company's performance during the challenging year. The company's board subsequently agreed to pay up to $18.7 billion in penalties to clear the decks for the company to start rebuilding its balance sheet, which helped to mitigate the impact of the spill on the company's reputation and finances. Despite the backlash, BP's shareholders still rejected the executive pay package, with 59% of them casting their ballots against it.

The dinosaur, which lived 161 million years ago, possessed iridescent feathers that resemble those of modern hummingbirds. The feathers were well-preserved and exhibited a range of colors, including rainbow hues. The dinosaur's head and chest were covered in iridescent feathers, which may have served as a social or sexual cue, like modern peacock tails. The dinosaur also had a bird-like body, including feathers required for flight, but it had a crested head that more closely resembled that of a Velociraptor. The researchers analyzed the fossilized remnants of the dinosaur's feathers and found that they were long, flat, and organized into sheets, which most closely matched the iridescent structures in the iridescent throat feathers of hummingbirds. The team sampled 66 sites across the fossil, comparing the melanosomes they saw with those from modern bird feathers. Although the team could not reconstruct the dinosaur's exact colors, they suspected that the observed pigments gave Caihong a rainbow glimmer. The researchers also noted that the dinosaur's frond-like tail had asymmetrical feathers, and their short, stiff leading edges would have borne the aerodynamic load of flight. Caihong is now the oldest known animal to have this key adaptation, with its frond-like tail being a dark background to provide contrast against the iridescent head during displays.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

The show featured the hosts' irreverent and eccentric personalities, as well as their love for hunting and shooting. Dickson Wright was a talented cook and a passionate food historian, known for her bold and unconventional recipes. She was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2009 and underwent treatment, but her condition worsened, leading to her passing in 2011. Throughout her career, Dickson Wright faced criticism for her high-fat ingredients in the show's recipes, which some viewers found difficult to follow. However, she remained committed to her passion for cooking and continued to appear in other TV programs, including \"Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner\" in 2012. Dickson Wright's legacy lives on through her books, including \"A History of English Food,\" which chronicled her experiences as a cook and a campaigner for rural life.

The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean.

{"pred": "Seattle's new sugary drink tax, which was introduced in 2018, has had a significant impact on the city's economy and residents' purchasing habits. The tax applies to sweetened beverages that contain milk as their primary ingredient, including soda, sports drinks, kombucha, and other sugary beverages. The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold, resulting in a price increase of approximately 64% for a case of Gatorade that cost $15.99 on December 31, 2017, now costs $26.33. The tax has affected retailers like Costco, which have placed signs directing customers to locations outside city limits where shoppers can buy the product without paying the massive tax. The tax has also resulted in a decrease in sales of sugary drinks in Seattle, with many residents expressing concern about the tax's impact on their wallets and the environment. The tax has also led to legal challenges, with the beverage industry and the Can the Tax Coalition challenging the tax's constitutionality and arguing that it violates the First Amendment's prohibition on government interference with private property rights. Despite these challenges, the tax has been successful in generating revenue for the city's coffers, with Seattle expected to make $15 million this year from the tax. However, the tax has also faced criticism from some residents who argue that it disproportionately affects low-income families and is regressive, meaning it drives up health care costs. The tax has also prompted numerous lawsuits, with the City Council of Seattle facing a lawsuit from the Tax Foundation, which calls on the city to provide more information to consumers about the tax's potential impact on their behavior.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

The study analyzed data from the Danish National Birth Cohort study between 1996 and 2002, where mothers reported on their children's behavior and the researchers looked at databases to determine how many prescriptions for ADHD drugs were written and how many children received a diagnosis of a severe form of ADHD called hyperkinetic disorder, or HKD. The study authors concluded that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with HKD or being prescribed ADHD medications and exhibiting ADHD-like behaviors. The study's authors suggest that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy is associated with higher risks, particularly when women reported use for 20 weeks or more. The study's authors acknowledge that the results do not show a cause-and-effect relationship, but they caution that more than half of all mothers in the study reported some acetaminophen use while pregnant.

However, Senate Democrats have rejected any changes to the ACA, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any bill that includes the repeal of the tax. The House and Senate are currently in negotiations to find a compromise, with the House aiming to pass a $986-billion continuing resolution that would continue to fund the ACA, while the Senate wants to pass a separate bill that would repeal the ACA's individual mandate and insurance marketplaces. If the House fails to pass either bill, a partial government shutdown is likely to occur on October 1, 2013, with the White House and congressional Democrats demanding that the House pass a short-term funding bill to keep the government open. The potential economic impact of a shutdown, including job losses, reduced access to healthcare, and decreased public services, is significant, particularly in the Washington region, where the federal government's presence accounts for one-third of the economy. Local governments have been preparing for the potential shutdown by setting aside pots of money in anticipation of a slowdown in government operations.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The Parker Solar Probe, named after Parker, will be launched in July 2018 and aim to study the sun's outer atmosphere, particularly the corona, which is the region where the sun's magnetic field interacts with the Earth's magnetic field. The spacecraft will travel to within four million miles of the sun's surface, inside the corona, and will face extreme temperatures of up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit. The Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with a heat shield made of advanced carbon-composite material to withstand the intense heat and radiation from the sun. The spacecraft will also have a suite of instruments to study the solar wind, including a camera to capture images of the sun and a sensor to measure the solar wind's electric and magnetic fields. The mission aims to unravel the mysteries of the solar wind, including its acceleration and how it interacts with the Earth's magnetic field. The Parker Solar Probe will also collect data on the solar wind's origins and its impact on the Earth's magnetic field, which is essential for understanding the solar system's evolution and interactions with other celestial bodies. The mission is expected to significantly advance our understanding of the sun and its role in shaping the solar system. The Parker Solar Probe will be the first spacecraft to reach the sun's surface and study its inner workings, providing valuable insights into the sun's behavior and the forces that govern its motion. The mission's success will not only benefit the scientific community but also contribute to the development of new technologies and techniques to mitigate the effects of space weather on critical infrastructures and services.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

The malware triggered a \"hook\" that started sucking up information on transactions in the memory of the cash register system or the server that controlled it. This allowed the attackers to steal credit and debit card data without the need for physical access to the stores. The malware was able to bypass Target's security measures, such as encryption, and was able to steal sensitive information such as credit card numbers, encrypted PINs, and other personal data. The attack was carried out by criminal groups in Eastern Europe, using software coding proficiency to execute the attack. The report from iSight, a computer firm hired to investigate the breach, detailed the type of software used in the attack, how it worked, and the regions where software capabilities exist to create the malware. The report concluded that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cybercrooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach in the future.

{"pred": "The discovery of Planet Nine, a potentially massive icy planet located beyond Pluto, has generated excitement among astronomers and space enthusiasts alike. The Caltech researchers, Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have presented strong evidence for the existence of Planet Nine using mathematical and computer modeling. According to their study, the planet is estimated to be between five and ten times the mass of Earth, and its orbit is highly elliptical, meaning it takes billions of years to complete one full revolution around the sun. The discovery challenges the traditional definition of a planet, which requires a celestial body to have a gravitational pull strong enough to alter the orbits of nearby objects. Planet Nine's existence is significant because it is located beyond Pluto's orbit, which was previously considered the ninth planet in the solar system. The discovery has sparked debates about the classification of other dwarf planets and asteroids in the outer solar system, with some arguing that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet and others supporting the current definition of a planet. The Caltech researchers expect to detect Planet Nine within the next five years using advanced telescopes, and they emphasize that the discovery will not lead to a Pluto-style debate. However, they acknowledge that the controversy surrounding Pluto's demotion remains ongoing, with some scientists advocating for its reinstatement as a planet and others maintaining that it should remain a dwarf planet. Despite the controversy, Planet Nine's discovery represents a significant milestone in our understanding of the solar system and the evolution of the Kuiper Belt, a region of the outer solar system characterized by numerous small, icy objects.", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The study involved 9,509 men and women with stable CAD, who underwent regular weight monitoring over a median of 12 visits. The researchers observed a significant correlation between weight fluctuations and an increased risk of new-onset diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and death. Specifically, individuals with the largest weight fluctuations experienced a 117% higher risk of heart attack, 124% higher risk of death, and 136% higher risk of stroke compared to those with the smallest weight fluctuations. The study also found a link between changes in body weight and an increased risk of new-onset diabetes, suggesting that pre-existing heart problems may contribute to weight fluctuations.\nThe researchers conducted a prospective cohort study, where participants with CAD were divided into two groups based on their weight fluctuations: those who experienced large fluctuations (up to 3.9 kg) and those who experienced small fluctuations (0.9 kg). Participants with larger weight fluctuations had a 117% higher risk of heart attack, 124% higher risk of death, and 136% higher risk of stroke compared to those with smaller weight fluctuations. The study adjusted for various risk factors, including age, sex, smoking status, and previous heart events, but the association remained significant.\nThe study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy weight in individuals with CAD, as excessive weight fluctuations may exacerbate existing cardiovascular conditions. The researchers recommend that individuals with CAD adopt a balanced and sustainable approach to weight management, focusing on maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress reduction. They also emphasize the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of weight fluctuations to identify potential triggers and adjust treatment plans accordingly.\nThe study raises concerns about the long-term health implications of yo-yo dieting in individuals with CAD, particularly those who are already at high risk due to the condition. While the study was observational, it provides evidence that weight fluctuations may contribute to an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Further research is needed to determine the underlying mechanisms behind these associations and develop targeted interventions to promote weight management in individuals with CAD.\nIn conclusion, the study underscores the importance of understanding the relationship between weight fluctuations and cardiovascular health in individuals with CAD.

According to a study led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, one in seven colon and rectal cancers in the country are now diagnosed in patients younger than age 50, which is when people are advised to begin routine screenings for these tumors. The study estimates that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50, making up a significant portion of the overall colorectal cancer population. The study found that younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, with 37,847 of them being diagnosed before age 50, compared to older patients who were 63% more likely to have advanced-stage cancer. Younger patients with tumors that had metastasized, or reached other organs, were also more likely than older people to get more aggressive treatments, with 72% of people under 50 getting surgery, compared to 63% of older individuals. Radiation therapy was more likely to be used with younger rectal cancer patients than in older patients, with 53% of younger patients receiving radiation, compared to 48% of older patients. The study also found that younger patients lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence, despite having more advanced disease. The study authors suggest that changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would potentially prevent more cancer deaths, but it is unclear whether this would happen consistently. The study highlights the importance of considering younger patients in the screening process, especially those with a family history of colorectal cancer or other risk factors. The study also notes that smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet are all risk factors for colon cancer, and a poor diet is particularly relevant given the increased incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients. The study concludes that more research is needed to fully understand the impact of screening for colorectal cancer on younger patients and determine whether it should be expanded to younger age groups.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The film \"Detroit\" directed by Kathryn Bigelow, released in 2018, is a dramatization of the events that occurred during the summer of 1967, when three young Black men were shot and killed by predominantly white police officers in the city during a period of racial unrest. The film explores the systemic oppression and mistreatment of Black people in the United States, focusing on the aftermath of the incident and the impact it had on the community.\n\nThe movie begins with a historical overview of the events leading up to the Motel siege, including the rise of racial tensions and the Detroit Riots of 1967. The film then delves into the details of the incident itself, depicting the police's brutal tactics towards the Black men, including torture, intimidation, and murder. The film's portrayal of the police officers, portrayed by actors such as Will Poulter, John Boyega, and Anthony Mackie, is nuanced and disturbing, highlighting the systemic racism and injustice that existed in the United States at the time.\n\nThe film also touches on the personal stories of the victims, including Larry Reed, a rising R&B singer, and his friend Fred Simple, a private security guard. The film provides insight into their experiences during the siege, including their attempts to escape the chaos and the tragic consequences of their actions.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of the film is its focus on the role of the National Guard in enforcing law and order during the riots. The film portrays the National Guard as a symbol of unity and law enforcement, but it also highlights the negative impact of their actions on the community, particularly on the Black men who were targeted by the police.\n\nThe film's depiction of the police officers, particularly the commanding officer of trigger-happy young patrol officer Philip Krauss, is particularly disturbing. The film suggests that the officers were motivated by racism and violence, rather than a desire to maintain law and order. The film's portrayal of the officers' actions is marked by a lack of empathy and compassion, and it raises questions about the accountability of law enforcement officials in the face of such atrocities.\n\nThe film's conclusion, featuring Larry Reed's resolution to continue his musical career in a more modest fashion than before, is a poignant moment that emphasizes the importance of finding ways to move forward from the trauma of the Motel siege.

The board members expressed satisfaction with the discussions, stating that the company's long-term interests were better served by being a private company. However, they also highlighted the need for clarity around the timing and details of the proposed acquisition, including the offer price, valuation, and the potential impact on Tesla's financial statements. The board statement did not mention the involvement of venture capital investor Steve Jurvetson or Musk's brother Kimbal Musk, who had previously signed onto the proposal. The board's decision to proceed with the proposal will depend on various factors, including the level of support from Tesla's shareholders, the timing of the transaction, and the potential regulatory hurdles. The board statement also raised questions about the transparency surrounding the potential de-listing to investors, particularly in light of the company's recent surge in stock price. Tesla shares have experienced wild swings in recent weeks, with the company reaching a peak of $368 and trading on the stock market halting.

Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev first proposed these three phases of galactic expansion in 1962 as a way to measure the energy consumption of increasingly powerful societies. A recent paper posted on the preprint journal arXiv.org has revived Kardashev's model and added a new, apocalyptic twist, suggesting that any advanced civilization worth their starships would understand the grim reality of universal expansion and expand throughout the universe, attempting to secure as many stars as possible before they become permanently inaccessible. To capture stars from other galaxies, scientists propose using a giant net around them, known as a Dyson sphere, which would be made of satellites and potentially use the star's energy to accelerate the whole ball of fire back toward the planet that wanted to use it. The paper suggests that such a civilization could be thousands, or even millions, of years older than ours who are already well into their Level III, star-harvesting phase. The discovery of such advanced civilizations would require enormous amounts of energy, and scientists propose creating a swarm of satellites in a spherical shell to harness much of the power of their star. The article also mentions the possibility of detecting these unusual light signatures beaming from the depths of the universe through telescopes, and the development of more precise instruments to detect them.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The show was created by Jon Stewart, who served as the host from 1996 to 2003, and was initially intended to be a continuation of the Kilborn show. However, Stewart's tenure was marred by controversy and criticism, particularly regarding the show's approach to political satire and its perceived lack of substance.\n\nDuring the Kilborn era, The Daily Show often focused on creating humorous headlines and mock news segments, poking fun at the news and political establishment. However, Stewart's departure from the show in 1998 marked a significant shift in the show's direction, as he sought to establish a more pointed and serious tone. This led to a change in the writing staff, with Stewart hiring a diverse group of writers who shared his commitment to using humor to challenge mainstream media narratives.\n\nIn 1999, Stewart brought on Ben Karlin as the new head writer, and the team worked to incorporate a higher quotient of righteous anger into the show's jokes. This resulted in a number of controversial episodes, including the \"fuck-you meeting\" episode, which was leaked to the New York Post and sparked widespread backlash. Despite this, Stewart remained committed to maintaining a distinct identity and tone, and he continued to push for changes to the show's format and content.\n\nAs the show evolved, Stewart and his team faced challenges from the remaining Kilborn writers, who were resistant to his attempts to restructure the show's content and approach. This led to a period of tension and conflict, culminating in a series of confrontations between Stewart and the writers, known as the \"fuck-you meeting.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, Stewart and his team were able to maintain a close relationship with the writers, and they eventually succeeded in bringing in a new head writer, Vance DeGeneres, who helped to steer the show in a more satirical and irreverent direction. This transition marked a turning point in the show's evolution, as it shifted away from its initial focus on parodying the news and towards addressing more complex issues and social commentary.\n\nIn 2003, Stewart's final season of The Daily Show aired, marking the end of an era for the show and the departure of many of its key contributors.

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved.

News Article 1:\n- Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator and candidate for the Republican nomination, criticized Mitt Romney's victory in the CPAC straw poll, stating that he did not perform well with party conservatives due to the lack of ticket purchases and support from the event.\n- Santorum claimed that Romney's campaign did not pay attendees to attend CPAC, which he believes is a way to manipulate the results. He also mentioned that he does not believe there was any issue with the straw poll itself, but rather with the way it was conducted.\n- The Romney campaign responded to Santorum's comments, stating that Santorum had a history of making statements that were not grounded in the truth. They also pointed out that Santorum's victory in the CPAC straw poll was separate from his win in the nationwide survey of conservatives conducted by CPAC organizers.\n- The Romney campaign further explained that they had planned to address the issue of contraception coverage in Catholic institutions, but ultimately decided to accommodate the bishops' position by offering a plan that would cover contraception expenses from insurance companies.\n\n2.

The settlement involves Magnolia taking steps to ensure compliance with lead-based paint regulations in future renovation projects, addressing lead-based paint hazards at high-risk homes in Waco, Texas, and educating the public to lead-based paint hazards and appropriate renovation procedures. The violations occurred due to the fact that Magnolia's renovations were shown on the HGTV series \"Fixer Upper\" and were not compliant with the RRP Rule's requirements, including obtaining firm certification from EPA before performing renovations covered by the RRP Rule, assigning a certified renovator to such renovations, providing home owners or occupants with an approved pamphlet about lead-based paint hazards prior to the renovation, posting signs to clearly define the work area and warn people to remain outside that area, complying with the RRP Rule's work practice standards, such as closing doors and windows to the interior work areas, covering floor surfaces, ducts and other openings to work areas with plastic sheeting, and covering the ground with plastic sheeting to capture falling paint chips from exterior renovations.

{"pred": "The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools in Kenya, dating back to around 320,000 years ago, provides evidence of significant technological advancements and the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. The oldest innovations were hand axes, shaped like a tear-drop with a rounded end and a pointed eye, and were used for both cutting and scraping. The next technological revolution, marked by the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, occurred tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought, occurring around 300,000 years ago. The Middle Stone Age tools were made from obsidian, which originated far from Olorgesailie, and were transported in chunks from 15 to 30 miles away. The team found that the Middle Stone Age tools were small, standardized, and made with obsidian rather than rock. Chemical tests showed that the raw materials came from 25-50 km away, and some from further afield. The Middle Stone Age tools were made at the site and not brought in as finished items, indicating that the technology was passed down through successive generations. The discovery challenges the traditional view that modernity arose outside of Africa and suggests that some hominin groups were doing seemingly \"modern\" things at this critical time period. The Middle Stone Age tools and the emergence of complex behaviors require an understanding of space and time, bringing materials over great distances and passing on technological skills through successive generations.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Kieran was born with bilateral microtia, a congenital deformity where the external ear is underdeveloped, affecting one in 100,000 babies in the UK. Despite his hearing loss, Kieran has been able to hear through a combination of previous surgeries and a hearing aid, and his parents have expressed immense joy at the procedure's success.\n\nKieran's mother, Louise Sorkin, shared her son's desire to have large ears, stating that he had always wanted them and that the procedure was a dream come true. The surgery involved removing cartilage from six of Kieran's ribs and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The surgeons used an outline of Mrs. Sorkin's ears as a template to ensure that the ears were as close as possible to the ear shape that Kieran might otherwise have had. The ear frameworks were then inserted into pockets in the skin and suctioned to take on the shape of an ear on both sides.\n\nThe procedure was considered cosmetic, not to improve hearing, but it brought significant psychological benefits to Kieran. His mother, Louise, expressed her satisfaction with the outcome, stating that she did not want children bullying him because of his appearance. She hoped that the procedure would encourage others to accept Kieran for who he was and improve his confidence.\n\nThe article also highlights advances in tissue engineering, particularly in tissue engineering that involves the creation of stem cells from a patient's fat tissue. Researchers at the Institute of Child Health, part of University College London, are working on developing stem cells from a child's own fat to create a new ear. The Institute aims to use stem cells from a child's own fat to create a new ear, which would be less invasive than the current treatment.\n\nIn addition to the surgical procedure, Kieran will require a follow-up operation in six months to make his ears stand out from the scalp more. However, he is already delighted with the result, expressing his excitement at being able to wear sunglasses and earphones. The surgery has brought a significant improvement in quality of life for children with microtia, improving their confidence and performance at school.\n\nOverall, the article reports on a remarkable achievement in medical science, where a nine-year-old boy with bilateral microtia has successfully received a pair of ears created from his own ribs at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year.

He tweeted that he was \"doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.\" This statement came after Obama had previously praised Trump's efforts to ensure a smooth transition.\n\n2. Trump's assessment of the Obama administration's actions comes amidst days of verbal sparring between the outgoing and incoming president. During a ceremony Tuesday marking the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor 75 years ago, Obama cautioned against \"the urge to turn inward\" and stressed a need to \"resist the urge to demonize those who are different.\" Trump also made it clear Wednesday that he is perturbed by a number of steps the Obama administration is taking in its final weeks related to Israel, including a speech that was planned Wednesday by Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Middle East policy.\n\n3. Trump's greatest success was the historic accord to curb Iran's nuclear development program and a landmark climate change treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming. However, his inability to halt the carnage in Syria, or to block Russia's growing influence, ranks as the most serious blot on his record.\n\n4.

{"pred": "The passage discusses the importance of habeas corpus, a legal procedure that ensures individuals are not held indefinitely without sufficient cause. The United States Constitution enshrines habeas corpus as a fundamental right, protecting citizens from arbitrary detention without due process. The passage highlights the significance of habeas corpus in preserving liberty, justice, and democracy, as the Founding Fathers recognized its necessity in the Magna Carta in 1215.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006 was passed, which revoked the right to habeas corpus for anyone detained at Guantánamo Bay, as well as for any foreigner the government detains anywhere and labels an \"enemy combatant.\" This provision applies to legal residents of the U.S. as well, meaning someone who has lived in the U.S. for years could potentially be labeled an \"enemy combatant\" and then thrown into prison with no legal recourse to challenge their detention.\n\nHowever, the Bush administration has managed to prevent the detainees from getting a fair hearing in the courts. In June 2007, the Supreme Court decided to hear CCR's most recent case challenging the detention of many Guantanamo detainees. These men have faced indefinite detention, sham trials, and conditions rapidly inducing psychological deterioration for nearly six years. In the coming Supreme Court term, for the third time, the high court will hear the detainees' cases and, we hope, once more seek to hold the Administration accountable and uphold habeas corpus.\n\nThe MCA extends a second-class system of justice far beyond Guantánamo to any non-citizen - including legal permanent residents of the U.S. - anywhere in the world whom the executive unilaterally declares to be an \"unlawful enemy combatant.\" This means that anyone, regardless of their citizenship status, can be held indefinitely without a trial or due process.\n\nThe passage emphasizes the importance of habeas corpus in ensuring that individuals are not arbitrarily detained without sufficient cause. The Supreme Court's decision to hear the habeas corpus cases challenges the MCA's interpretation of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures, arguing that the government's actions violate the principle of habeas corpus. The case could lead to a broader recognition of chimpanzees as legal persons, potentially freeing them from captivity and allowing them to live in a sanctuary.\n\nThe passage also highlights the potential impact of the habeas corpus ruling on other animals, such as elephants, great apes, and whales and dolphins", "answers": ["The writ of habeas corpus lets prisoners appear in court to make their captors justify why they're being held.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps.

{"pred": "The United States Justice Department has announced that it will file charges against Gibson Guitar Corporation, a popular manufacturer of musical instruments, for trafficking in illegally obtained wood. The company was raided by federal marshals in Tennessee in August 2011, during which they seized a shipment of ebony from Madagascar. The Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals, making it illegal to import illegally obtained wood. However, Gibson has consistently purchased wood from Madagascar without proper certification, violating the law. The Justice Department's investigation found that Gibson knew that its imports from Madagascar contained tainted wood, and it took steps to maintain a supply chain that was connected to illegal timber harvests. The company maintains that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law, but the Justice Department has not provided details about how or if Gibson has violated the law. The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, expressed frustration with the government's actions, stating that the company has been injured to millions of dollars and has not been charged with anything. The Justice Department's court motion asserts that Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband, based on emails that seem to show Gibson taking steps to maintain a supply chain that's been connected to illegal timber harvests. The company's attorney, Ronald Bienstock, warns clients to be wary of traveling abroad with old guitars, because the law says owners can be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The Lacey Act also covers the trade in vintage instruments, and Nashville's George Gruhn, a leading dealer of old guitars, is concerned about the potential for unintended consequences if the law is retroactively applied to vintage instruments. The Justice Department's efforts to enforce the Lacey Act are being criticized by guitar builders who fear that they will need to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago, and who worry about the potential for delays and legal challenges.

The maps reveal that the released water has a representative D/H value enriched by a factor of about 7 relative to Earth's ocean (VSMOW), indicating great water loss. The second article reveals the existence of a massive ancient ocean on Mars, covering a fifth of the planet's surface and holding 20 million cubic kilometers of water, or more than is found in the Arctic Ocean. The third article discusses the analysis of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, revealing the chemical composition of the atmosphere's vapor and suggesting that an ocean at least a mile deep covered a significant fraction of the Martian surface four billion years ago. The data indicates that the planet lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The findings challenge previous beliefs about the prevalence of water on Mars and suggest that the planet may have been habitable in the distant past. The fourth article discusses the potential implications of these findings for the search for life on Mars, with the European Space Agency sending its Exomars rover to the red planet in 2018 to search for chemical signatures of life. The rover will look for chemical signatures of life, potentially emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian soil. The findings suggest that life was possible on Mars, although the likelihood of it being inhabited is uncertain. The fifth article discusses the reasons why life might have been possible on Mars, with a paper published in 2014 arguing that the early Martian atmosphere was unusually rich in heavy hydrogen and that much of it escaped along with the ordinary variety.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The movie follows a veteran con man named Nicky Spurgeon and his young accomplice, Jess Barrett, as they navigate a world of con artists and wealthy individuals. The film's premise is that Nicky is teaching Jess how to steal, and the story unfolds as they try to con a wealthy businessman, played by BD Wong, who is seeking revenge after being conned by Jess in a previous con. The film is set in various locations, including a casino, a racetrack, and a football game, and features a diverse cast of actors, including Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck, and Adrian Martinez.\n\nThe article highlights the casting choices for the film, with Will Smith being praised for his portrayal of Nicky, a charismatic and confident conman who exudes charm and authority. Margot Robbie, on the other hand, is cast as Jess, a young Australian woman who becomes Nicky's apprentice and learns the art of pickpocketing. The article notes that the film's plot revolves around the con artist's world, which is revealed to be a complex and secretive underworld, rather than the traditional con stories that audiences are familiar with.\n\nThe article also discusses the film's production team, including director John Requa and Glenn Ficarra, who are credited with bringing the con genre back to Hollywood.

Researchers from UC Berkeley, led by Professor Jack Gallant, reconstructed YouTube videos from viewers' brain activity using functional MRI scans. The team trained a computer model to match features of the videos, such as colors, shapes, and movements, with patterns of brain activity. Subtle changes in blood flow to visual areas of the brain predicted what was on the screen at the time, including scenes from movies that the subject had watched. The reconstructed videos are blurry due to the layers of YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity pattern. The technology has the potential to revolutionize fields such as entertainment, advertising, and medical diagnosis, where it could provide insights into our dreams, memories, and even fantasies.\n\nThe study marks a significant milestone in the field of neuroscience, as it demonstrates the brain's capacity to process and interpret visual information without external stimuli. This technology could potentially be used to broadcast imagery, such as the scenes that play out inside our minds, independent from vision. However, the accuracy of the technology's predictions depends on how closely those abstract visual experiences are to the real thing.

In 2011, a team of French government investigators working on the Air France hunt located the wreckage, and they believe that a deliberate act caused the disappearance. The team used Bayesian statistics named after a British Presbyterian minister called Thomas Bayes to analyze the data and assess the likelihood of various scenarios, including mechanical failures, historical crashes, and the possibility of a deliberate act.

He was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm and had previously been convicted of jumping bail and carrying a weapon across state lines in 2004. Durst's guilty plea in February resulted in a plea agreement that called for an 85-month prison sentence, followed by three years of supervised release. However, Durst still faces a separate murder charge in California, in which he is accused of killing his friend Susan Berman in 2000 to keep her from talking to prosecutors about the disappearance of Durst's first wife in 1982. Durst maintains his innocence and has consistently denied any involvement in the death of Berman. His attorneys have requested that he be housed at FCI Terminal Island, a federal prison with medical facilities near Los Angeles, instead of serving his sentence in Louisiana. Durst's lawyers argue that his advanced age and poor health make him a flight risk and that he should be placed in a lower-security facility to avoid potential complications during his time in prison.

The report finds that the administration intentionally misled the public about the attack being caused by a protest against an anti-Muslim video, rather than a terrorist attack. The report also reveals that the administration failed to properly investigate the incident and did not provide adequate support to the U.S. military in responding to the attack. The report concludes that the administration's handling of the Benghazi situation contributed to the deaths of four U.S. service members and the destruction of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.\n\nThe second news passage focuses on the release of a supplemental report by the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which adds additional perspectives and insights to the original report. The report provides a detailed timeline of events leading up to the attack, including the call between Secretary Clinton and President Magariaf, the discussions between acting Assistant Secretary Beth Jones and Libyan Ambassador Aujali, and the phone calls between State Department Deputy Secretary Thomas Nides and Egyptian ambassador to the U.S. The report also highlights the role of the White House in shaping the narrative and the administration's failure to properly assess the threat posed by the extremist group Ansar al-Sharia.\n\nThe third news passage discusses the criticism leveled against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi.

The majority of these individuals reside in wealthy countries such as the USA, where obesity rates exceed 5% of the population. In contrast, obesity rates are much higher in developing countries, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands. The study, conducted by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, found that obesity rates have risen significantly over the past three decades, with a 28% increase in adults and 47% in children. The study also revealed that obesity is a complex issue influenced by factors such as access to affordable, unhealthy foods, sedentary lifestyles, and cultural norms. The study highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing obesity, which includes reducing calorie intake, improving dietary composition, promoting physical activity, and addressing the social and economic factors contributing to obesity. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study rising obesity among children worldwide and propose solutions. The study suggests that obesity is a major risk factor for various chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers.

The final nine governorates have also been affected, with the Brotherhood's strongholds of Gharbiya and Daqahliyya in the Delta receiving significant support. The Brotherhood has stated that it aims to form a coalition or unity government to avoid instability and uncertainty, but it is unlikely to win a clear majority of the seats in the full Parliament. The trial of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, who is currently serving a sentence in prison, continues, with the prosecution accusing him of implementing \"tyrannical rule\" and attempting to install his son, Gamal, in his place. The trial is expected to result in a harsh penalty, with Mubarak facing charges of corruption and conspiracy to kill protesters. The Brotherhood's allies, including the liberals, are also expected to contest the remaining seats, potentially challenging the dominance of the ultraconservative Islamists.

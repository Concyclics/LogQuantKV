Microsoft claims that the device is only active when specifically triggered by \"Xbox On\" and that it runs in a low-power mode for listening.\n\nXbox's Kinect, like the previous version, faces privacy concerns due to its ability to recognize and process audio, including heartbeats and individual voices. While Microsoft asserts that it respects privacy and has implemented privacy protections, critics argue that a fixed, always-listening device raises questions about potential data breaches.\n\nIn summary, these tech companies are pushing the boundaries of voice and gesture-based interactions, but the increased surveillance has sparked debates about the intrusiveness of these features and the potential for data misuse. Microsoft, in particular, has faced criticism for its always-on Kinect, with users expressing concern about the device's constant monitoring.

Former cheerleader Krystal C., who filed the initial class-action lawsuit in 2014, alleged that the cheerleaders were underpaid and not compensated for practice time.\n\nThe settlement comes after years of legal battles, with the Jets denying the claims and disputing the allegations.

This settlement sets a precedent for other NFL cheerleading teams, such as the Buffalo Bills, which have faced similar wage lawsuits.\n\nState Senator Diane Savino, who has advocated for fair pay for cheerleaders, praised the settlement and called for similar actions from the Buffalo Bills. Other NFL teams, including the Cincinnati Bengals and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, have also reached settlements with their cheerleaders, with some receiving higher amounts than the Jets' $325,000.\n\nThe settlement in this case, according to attorney Patricia Pierce, demonstrates that the cheerleaders' hourly pay fell significantly short of minimum wage, with the actual hourly rate being argued to be around $1.50.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found them to be inconsistent with a body lying flat, as previously suggested by the cloth's design. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions and angles of the wounds, and their findings challenge the traditional interpretation of the blood flow on the shroud.\n\nThe blood on the shroud contains iron oxide, which could be from pigment or blood, supporting the idea that it dates back to the time of Jesus, but the radiocarbon dating places it between 1260 and 1390 CE. The researchers found that the blood flow patterns on the shroud do not match the expected angles for a person on a cross, with rivulets on the hand and forearm inconsistent with the 45-degree angle typically associated with a standing position. The analysis, particularly of the \"blood belt\" at the waist, revealed that the blood flow is not consistent across different parts of the body, further suggesting a standing model was used to create the bloodstains.\n\nThe study's findings, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, challenge the traditional understanding of the shroud's origin and raise doubts about its authenticity.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The passage also mentions the benefits of online paperless payday loans without credit checks, which can cover unexpected expenses and provide relief for various financial necessities.\n\nPassage 2 introduces an individual named Jay who has a passion for cars and invites readers to share their favorite vehicles. However, this is not a part of the original news content and seems to be a separate, unrelated topic. To summarize the news, we can focus on the financial advice provided in Passage 1:\n\n- There is a need for a simpler and faster process when applying for cash help, as it often involves lengthy formalities and loan forms.\n- Emergency cash, while available, comes with a cost, especially if not repaid promptly, as it affects future expenses.\n- Savings are recommended as a cheaper alternative to short-term loans, and using a creditworthy lender can avoid predatory practices.\n- Online paperless payday loans without credit checks offer a convenient option for unexpected expenses, but applicants must meet certain eligibility criteria, such as being a UK resident and having a stable income.\n- The loans typically have a repayment period, with affordable monthly installments, and the interest rates should be considered when taking out the loan.\n- The maximum amount for no credit check loans is usually between £80 and £1,500, making them accessible for small, immediate needs.\n\nIn conclusion, both passages discuss the importance of financial management and the availability of loan options, with a focus on affordable and convenient alternatives to cash advances.

The trail, which stretches 2,650 miles across California, Oregon, and Washington, has seen a steady rise in long-distance hikers, with 3,346 people completing the entire hike since the 1950s. The 2016 hiking season saw 4,000+ long-distance permits issued, causing concern about overcrowding, particularly during the peak permit window.\n\nThe Pacific Crest Trail Association implemented a 50-permit daily quota system in 2015 to manage the growing number of hikers and protect the fragile desert ecosystems. This move, led by trail volunteers like U.S. Forest Service's Jules Fijolek, aims to prevent overuse and minimize environmental damage. The system has been effective in dispersing hikers, but some argue that the current capacity could be reached soon, necessitating further adjustments.\n\nThe increase in female hikers, as mentioned by PCTA's Haskel, suggests a shift in demographics, with more women being inspired by \"Wild\" and other media attention.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered a dinosaur with iridescent feathers, named Caihong juji, in northeastern China. This small dinosaur, resembling a bird with a rainbow-colored crest, had feathers that shimmered like those of hummingbirds. The nearly complete fossil, found in the Tiaojishan Formation, revealed iridescent structures in the head, neck, and chest, suggesting the presence of rainbow-like colors. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, suggests that Caihong may have used its feathers for communication or display, possibly similar to the way modern birds use their iridescent plumage.\n\nCaihong's feathers, with their distinct barbs and vanes, displayed a unique pattern that aligns with the nanostructures found in some modern bird species, particularly in hummingbirds. These nanostructures, which are thought to be melanosomes, indicate that the dinosaur had a range of colors, including shades of grey and black, as well as vibrant hues.\n\nThe presence of a crest and a bird-like body with flight feathers, but a non-avian pelvis, suggests that Caihong may have glided or flown, possibly from trees to hunt small mammals. The study's authors propose that the dinosaur's tail feathers, which were particularly well-preserved, could have played a role in aerodynamics.\n\nThis discovery challenges the traditional understanding of dinosaur feather evolution, as it represents the earliest known creature with asymmetrical feathers, a trait used in modern birds for flight. The researchers also note that the fossil's feathers, despite being well-preserved, may not have fully preserved their original colors due to compaction during fossilization.\n\nIn summary, Caihong juji, the \"rainbow dinosaur,\" is a significant find that adds to our understanding of dinosaur feather diversity and the potential functions of iridescent plumage in these ancient creatures.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial soda tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding community programs, has faced widespread backlash and is seen as a burden on businesses and consumers. Formerly praised as a cutting-edge policy, the tax has led to a significant increase in the cost of sugary beverages, with some products seeing a hike of over 64%. Retailers like Costco have responded by directing customers to purchase outside the city to avoid the tax, resulting in reduced sales for Seattle. The tax has been criticized for its regressiveness, as it disproportionately affects low-income families and is opposed by groups like libertarians and those concerned about job loss. While some argue that the tax may have unintended consequences, such as driving people to buy in neighboring areas, the short-term impact on sales and revenue has been negative for businesses and the city's budget. The tax's effectiveness in achieving its health goals and the potential long-term economic consequences are being questioned. A similar tax in Philadelphia saw a decrease in sales after its implementation, and a similar situation is emerging in Seattle.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

{"pred": "A new study published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics has found a potential link between acetaminophen, commonly used in pregnancy to relieve pain and treat fever, and an increased risk of ADHD in children. Pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol, were found to have a 29% higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD and a 37% higher risk of hyperkinetic syndrome, a rarer diagnosis. However, the researchers caution that this does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship and emphasize the need for further research.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data from 64,000 Danish children and their mothers, suggests that acetaminophen use during pregnancy may be associated with the development of these conditions, but it's not the sole factor. Other factors, such as underlying infections or genetic predispositions, cannot be ruled out. The researchers, including Dr. Beate Ritz from the University of California Los Angeles, advise pregnant women to avoid chronic or long-term use of acetaminophen and to consult with their doctors if considering any medication.\n\nMcNeil Consumer Healthcare, the manufacturer of Tylenol, stated in a statement that they are aware of the study but emphasize that there are no current randomized controlled studies linking acetaminophen use to adverse effects on child development.

The House of Representatives has passed a bill that includes conditions, including a one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and a repeal of the medical device tax, but Senate Democrats have rejected any changes to the health law, with President Barack Obama threatening to veto any bill with these provisions. House Speaker John Boehner aims to appease conservative Republicans by pushing for the ACA delay, while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is urging a tough negotiating stance, demanding no concessions from Republicans.\n\nIf the House passes a bill with the ACA conditions, Senate Democrats are expected to table the amendments, allowing the House to move forward with a short-term funding bill. However, Senate Majority Leader Reid plans to strip the ACA provisions, and if the House sends a bill with the health care delay, a government shutdown could occur. The Senate's options are limited, as they are not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon, and negotiations could be complicated by the desire of both parties to avoid blame for a shutdown.\n\nThe potential economic impact of a shutdown is significant, particularly in the Washington region, where the federal government employs a large portion of the workforce.

There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The Neiman Marcus breach, which began as early as July 2022, involved the theft of customer payment card information but did not compromise sensitive personal data such as Social Security numbers. Neiman Marcus initially held back from disclosing the breach until it had enough evidence to confirm the incident. The company later disclosed the data breach and announced it had taken steps to notify affected customers.\n\nTarget, on the other hand, suffered a larger and more significant data breach in which credit and debit card numbers, along with personal information, were stolen from approximately 100 million customers. The breach was attributed to malware placed in point-of-sale (POS) systems, with the source of the software being described as part of a coordinated international hacking campaign. The report from the computer firm iSight, shared with the US Secret Service, highlights the use of a specific type of malware, known for its ability to extract credit card information without encryption, and points to regions with strong software coding capabilities for POS malware development.\n\nBoth Neiman Marcus and Target are under investigation by state attorneys general, who are examining whether the attacks are connected and looking into the source of the malware. The report from iSight, while not implicating the attackers directly, suggests that the operation was \"new to eCrime\" and demonstrated innovation in evading detection.\n\nThe Neiman Marcus breach was not as extensive as Target's, but it still raised concerns among customers and the company. Neiman Marcus defended its decision to wait for confirmation before disclosing the breach, while Target, in contrast, notified its customers promptly and faced criticism for the delay. Both retailers have offered free credit monitoring services to affected customers.\n\nIn the broader context, the report indicates that the breach was part of a larger, international effort targeting multiple retailers, suggesting a coordinated and well-planned cyber attack.

This was after the animal had injured a person and became aggressive due to a crowd that gathered. The second lion, Mohawk, a popular and well-known lion in Nairobi National Park, was shot and killed by rangers when he attacked a motorcyclist, as the park's rangers were unable to tranquilize him due to the risk to human life.\n\nIn South Africa, a different lion, Sylvester, was being considered for relocation or killing after escaping from Karoo National Park, as it had previously eluded capture and posed a threat to humans. The park's fences were cited as a factor in the lions' escapes due to the noise from nearby construction projects.\n\nBoth countries are grappling with the challenge of managing lions in the face of habitat loss and growing human settlements.

A lead vessel containing ashes from John's alleged grave, believed to date back to the 6th century, was found in a reliquary within an early Christian basilica. The discovery, made at the ancient fortress site of Poros (also known as Burgas), is considered a rare and holy possession by early Christians, believed to possess healing properties.\n\nThe reliquary, now housed in the Burgas Regional Museum of History, is adorned with religious symbols and is about 2.2 cm long, reflecting its status as a sacred artifact. Alongside the relic, archaeologists also discovered a 10th-century Bulgarian royal seal at the site. The lead tube, which holds the ashes, is unique, with only 43 known lead tube reliquaries from this time period, and it is believed to have been brought back by a pilgrim from Ephesus, the center of Christian pilgrimage during the 6th century.\n\nThe discovery has historical and religious significance, as it connects the Burgas site to the revered pilgrimage centers of the time, including the grave of John the Apostle in Turkey. The lead tube's presence suggests that the ashes may have been used for miraculous healings on May 8, the day associated with John's death, and the belief that a holy powder, or manna, would appear on the site.\n\nThe discovery has been described as one of the most important in the museum's history by Milen Nikolov, the museum's director.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

According to an analysis of data from the University of Michigan, one in seven colorectal cancer patients is now under 50, with a growing number diagnosed at a younger age. This shift has implications for screening guidelines, as younger patients tend to have more aggressive forms of the disease but also see better survival rates when diagnosed.\n\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data revealed that younger patients, particularly those under 50, are more likely to have distant-stage tumors, which are more aggressive and have higher mortality rates. However, they are also more likely to receive more aggressive treatments, such as surgery for distant rectal cancer, compared to older patients.\n\nDespite the higher likelihood of advanced disease at diagnosis, younger colorectal cancer patients have a slightly better five-year survival rate than their older counterparts, particularly for localized tumors. This finding prompts a debate about whether screening guidelines should be revised to start at a younger age, similar to breast cancer screening, which begins at 40.\n\nResearchers, including those from the University of Michigan and the David Geffen School of Medicine, acknowledge the need for improved risk assessment and increased awareness among healthcare providers, as symptoms of colorectal cancer, such as anemia and changes in bowel habits, may be overlooked in younger patients.\n\nThe study by Cancer, published in 2016, suggests that nearly 15% of colorectal cancers are diagnosed in individuals below 50, but the impact on overall screening guidelines is uncertain. Some experts, like Dr. Andrew Chan from Harvard Medical School, argue that the increased incidence of colon cancer in younger adults might be due to environmental factors, and more research is needed to determine if changing screening guidelines would be beneficial.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising number of younger patients with colorectal cancer calls for a reevaluation of screening practices and highlights the need for better risk assessment and tailored treatment options for this age group. However, the decision to alter the recommended age for screening is still a topic of discussion and further research.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The site, located near Warratyi, was discovered during a survey by local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard, who noticed a blackened rock shelter with evidence of fire and human activity. The site contains artifacts such as stone axes, ochre, and bone fragments, indicating the presence of humans using advanced technologies like bone tools and ochre.\n\nThe age of the site, estimated to be around 49,000 years, pushes back the timeline of human settlement in Australia's arid interior, suggesting a much earlier colonization than previously thought. The presence of megafauna bones, including Diprotodon optatum, suggests coexistence and possibly interaction between humans and these giant animals. The findings challenge the assumption that climate change was the sole driver of megafauna extinction.\n\nThe excavation process at Warratyi involved careful dating techniques, such as single-grain and multiple-grain optical dating of quartz, to determine the age of the artifacts and fossils. The study also uncovered evidence of the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and the development of bone technology.\n\nThe site's location and the presence of burnt eggshells indicate the use of fire for both cooking and possibly as a signaling device. The combination of these findings supports the idea that humans colonized the region earlier than previously believed, with the Adnyamathanha people having a cultural connection to the area.\n\nThe discovery challenges the traditional narrative of a linear migration from the coastal regions to the interior, suggesting a more complex and diverse history of human settlement in Australia.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The first passage introduces a model proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, which suggests three stages of technological advancement (Level I, II, and III) where civilizations expand their energy resources to maximize their potential. The paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, takes this concept further by suggesting that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for survival as the universe expands and makes stars inaccessible. Hooper argues that advanced civilizations would actively capture and harvest stars to secure their energy sources and maintain contact with other galaxies.\n\nIn the context of energy extraction, Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations, such as Type III civilizations, would create massive structures like Dyson spheres or statites to harness energy from their parent stars. These structures, which could consist of millions of satellites or rings, would collect and beam energy back to the home planet.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

The show initially focused on lampooning local news and the conventions of the time, using humor to criticize the pop culture and lifestyle aspects of news coverage. Jon Stewart took over the show in 1999, and his tenure brought significant changes, including a shift towards more political satire and a focus on critiquing the media and political establishment.\n\nDuring Stewart's early days, there were tensions between him and the writers, who felt entitled to their success under the previous host, Craig Kilborn. Stewart's desire to make the show smarter and more pointed led to a confrontation with the writers, resulting in some writers leaving or being reprimanded. The show's new writers, like Ben Karlin and Stephen Colbert, brought a different perspective, with Karlin's hiring as head writer being based on his understanding of deconstruction and criticism of hypocrisy.\n\nColbert, a former correspondent, joined the show as a writer and eventually became a correspondent himself, known for his straight-faced delivery and ability to blend humor with political commentary. Carell, another correspondent, became a key figure with his on-screen presence and the \"Steve Carell bus\" segment, which mocked political candidates and became a memorable moment in the show's history.\n\nThe Daily Show's success led to a shift in the media landscape, with the rise of cable news networks like Fox News and MSNBC, and the show's influence grew as it critiqued the media's biases and the political landscape.

{"pred": "The news articles cover various aspects of ancient human history and technological advancements, particularly in the context of the East African region. Here's a summary of the main findings:\n\n1. A study published in Science suggests that climate-driven changes in the region may have led to the development of tool-making innovations and trading networks among early Homo sapiens or their relatives around 320,000 years ago. This includes the use of larger, more specialized tools and the discovery of obsidian, which came from distant sources, indicating long-distance communication and potentially the spread of technology.\n\n2. The Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya, home to the oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, displays a shift in tool technology from larger, more primitive tools to smaller, specialized ones. This period, around 320,000 years ago, coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens or a closely related species. The tools were likely made using obsidian, suggesting the existence of trading networks among early humans.\n\n3. The researchers argue that the frequent shifts in climate, particularly between wet and dry periods, forced early humans to adapt and expand their foraging range, leading to increased tool-making and potentially the development of a more diverse set of stone tools. This period also saw the appearance of pigment use, possibly for signaling group identity or status.\n\n4. The study challenges the traditional view of a sudden \"human revolution\" around 40,000-50,000 years ago, where modern behaviors were believed to have emerged. Instead, the authors propose that some of these behaviors, such as technological innovation and the use of obsidian, were present in the African Stone Age much earlier, around 300,000 years ago.\n\n5. The evidence suggests that these changes were likely driven by environmental pressures, such as climate fluctuations, which forced early humans to develop more sophisticated tools and engage in long-distance trade, possibly indicating the emergence of social networks and cultural complexity.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the adaptive responses of early humans to shifting environments, the importance of long-distance trade, and the gradual development of complex behaviors and technologies in the African continent before the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The new law, which has been in the works for decades, eliminates the penalty of criminal records for possessing up to 2 ounces of marijuana, with exceptions for medical and religious uses. The legislation also allows for the cultivation of up to five plants on any premises, and tourists with a prescription for medical marijuana abroad can obtain permits to legally purchase small amounts.\n\nPeter Bunting, Jamaica's national security minister, clarified that the law does not signal a relaxation of the country's stance on transnational drug trafficking, stating that security forces will continue to enforce international treaty obligations. The move is seen as a response to the island's long-standing issue with marijuana, which has been both culturally ingrained and a source of criminalization, particularly for Rastafarians.\n\nThe legislation is expected to boost the country's potential in the medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the development of cannabis-based products. However, the US Assistant Secretary for Counter-Narcotics Affairs, William Brownfield, emphasized that while Jamaica's law is sovereign, drug trafficking remains illegal and international conventions, including those related to drug trafficking, must be upheld.\n\nJamaica's decision to decriminalize marijuana aligns with a growing trend of US states legalizing marijuana for recreational and medical use, with Alaska becoming the third US state to do so recently. The move also follows Uruguay's 2009 decision to create a legal marijuana market and other countries like Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile that have relaxed restrictions on the drug.\n\nThe regulation of the cannabis industry and licensing authority, however, is still in the works, and the impact on crime rates and transnational drug trafficking will be closely monitored. The legislation is seen as a significant step towards addressing the social and legal issues surrounding marijuana in Jamaica, while also opening up new economic opportunities.", "answers": ["Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself.

{"pred": "In recent news, researchers have discovered significant evidence of a large ancient ocean on Mars, suggesting that the planet was more habitable in its youth. A team from NASA, using powerful telescopes, found that a massive ocean covering around 20% of the northern hemisphere, similar to Earth's Atlantic, existed 4.5 billion years ago. The water was estimated to be up to 137 meters deep, with a high concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, indicating a global equivalent water layer.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, revealed that Mars had a more extensive water presence than previously thought, with a global ocean covering a fifth of the planet's surface. The deuterium enrichment in the polar regions suggests that water on Mars was significantly enriched in deuterium, reaching up to 8 times Earth's standard, or VSMOW, ratio. This high level of deuterium indicates that Mars may have had a more substantial water reservoir during its early history.\n\nThe presence of a global ocean on Mars challenges the conventional understanding that the planet was largely dry and uninhabitable. The inferred water loss due to the leakage of hydrogen into space has led to a higher concentration of deuterium in the remaining water, which is now concentrated in the northern low-lying plains. The discovery of such a large body of water strengthens the case for the possibility of past habitability on Mars.\n\nMethane detection by the Mars rover Curiosity has also been mentioned, raising questions about the potential for life on the planet.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

Instead, it relies on Smith's charm and Robbie's transformation throughout the film.\n\nWill Smith plays Nicky, a seasoned con artist, and Margot Robbie's character, Jess, is a young apprentice who becomes involved in his schemes. The review points out that the film's attempts to create a seductive atmosphere, particularly in the chemistry between Smith and Robbie, are the only redeeming qualities. However, the movie's narrative is criticized for being absurd and illogical, with a confusing mix of elements that make it difficult to follow.\n\nOne scene in the film, featuring a scene withBD Wong, is highlighted as a standout moment due to its captivating performance. The reviewer notes that while the film has some amusing moments and a talented supporting cast, the central relationship between Smith and Robbie lacks depth, as their interactions seem forced and the characters' motivations are unclear.\n\nThe casting of Will Smith and Margot Robbie in the roles, despite initial interest from high-profile actors like Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lawrence, is seen as a successful pairing that brings a touch of lightheartedness to the otherwise dull genre.

The study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaur vocalizations, particularly those of the iconic Tyrannosaurus rex, were more akin to the coos of birds like doves or pigeons. These \"closed-mouth vocalizations\" involved low, throaty sounds, rather than the high-pitched screams often portrayed in films.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who created the dinosaur sounds for the 1993 film Jurassic Park, explained that many of the noises used in the movie, such as the raptor hiss, were inspired by real animal sounds. For instance, the raptor's \"hiss\" was based on a goose's angry response, and the T. rex's roar was a combination of a baby elephant's sound slowed down. The study also found that large-bodied birds, like ostriches, may have had similar vocal abilities to dinosaurs, as they possess a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch that allows for low, rumbling sounds.\n\n闭嘴发声，即通过封闭的喉部和口腔产生声音，是鸟类独有的特性。这种发声方式通常伴随着低频音调，与通过打开的喙发出的高音调叫声不同。研究人员分析了208种鸟类中，约四分之一的物种使用了闭嘴发声，而体型较大的鸟类，如鸽子和鹦鹉，更倾向于这种行为。闭嘴发声在体型较小的鸟类中较为罕见，这可能是因为它们需要更大的肺活量来产生这些声音。\n\n闭嘴发声的起源可能与恐龙的某些特征有关，因为一些科学家推测，大型恐龙可能也有类似闭嘴发声的能力，但没有直接化石证据支持。恐龙学家Julia Clarke表示，理解现代鸟类的发声方式对于推测恐龙的声音至关重要，因为“恐龙的世界可能与我们想象的完全不同”。\n\n闭嘴发声的进化表明，至少16种不同的鸟类群体独立发展出了这种发声方式，这在体型较大的鸟类中更为普遍。研究人员认为，这种行为可能是为了性选择的鸣叫展示，因此可能与开放嘴巴的发声行为共存。\n\n总的来说，尽管我们无法听到恐龙真实的叫声，但通过对现有鸟类的研究，我们可以推断出这些古代爬行动物的叫声可能并不像电影中那样震撼，而是更接近于鸽子或鹦鹉的咕咕声。这项研究不仅", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

According to a recent study published in the Lancet, the United States leads the world in obesity, with 13% of the population being obese, despite having only 5% of the global population. However, the problem is not unique to the US, as obesity rates are rising globally, with no country seeing a decline in the past three decades.\n\nThe study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, reveals that obesity is a growing concern in many countries, with rates increasing in both men, women, and children. Poor countries, particularly in the Middle East, Central America, and the Pacific, are experiencing particularly high obesity rates, with some nations seeing rates exceed 50% in both men and women.\n\nThe rise in obesity is attributed to factors such as increased calorie intake, changes in diet, reduced physical activity, and shifts in gut bacteria. The report highlights that obesity is not limited to wealthy nations, as it is also prevalent in poorer countries where food has become more affordable and accessible.\n\nThe global obesity rate has surged from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013, with about 30% of the world's population now considered overweight or obese. The authors of the study express concern that there are no successful strategies to combat obesity, as no country has seen a decline in obesity rates over the past three decades.\n\nIn developed countries, obesity rates have slowed in some cases, but the problem remains pervasive, with obesity affecting one-third of adults and a quarter of children. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified obesity as a major risk factor for various health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and chronic diseases.\n\nThe Lancet article, which includes the study, does not delve into the root causes but suggests that the overconsumption of unhealthy, high-calorie foods and sedentary lifestyles contribute to the problem.

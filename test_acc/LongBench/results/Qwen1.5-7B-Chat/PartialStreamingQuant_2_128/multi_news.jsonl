This unexpected result, achieved through an analysis of Google-like methods on 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, challenges conventional wisdom and places Linnaeus ahead of more famous figures like Michael Jackson, Adolf Hitler, and even the Pope.\n\nThe study aimed to uncover potential biases in the online encyclopedia's representation of historical figures, particularly regarding gender, time, and region. It discovered that Wikipedia's attention tends to skew towards figures born in Western countries after the 17th century and that local figures are disproportionately represented due to the cultural connections within their respective language editions.\n\nThe researchers used Google PageRank, a measure of webpage importance based on the number of links pointing to it, to initially rank individuals. However, this method was flawed when applied to Linnaeus, as his extensive work in taxonomy led to a disproportionate number of links across all Wikipedia language versions.\n\nTo correct for this bias, Eom's team developed a new ranking system called CheiRank, which considers both incoming and outgoing links, reflecting the importance of an individual's influence on other content.

Microsoft's Xbox One, with its always-on listening mode, uses the Kinect for voice commands and activity recognition, raising worries about constant surveillance. The new Kinect can even detect heartbeats and recognize individual voices. Xbox's spokesperson acknowledged the privacy concern but assured that the system runs in a low-power listening mode in this state. Microsoft's privacy statement emphasizes that it only listens for specific cues like \"Xbox on\" and has a history of protecting user data. In both cases, users can opt-out of certain data collection, but the devices still collect non-sensitive information for performance improvement.

{"pred": "The New York Jets cheerleaders, known as the Flight Crew, have reached a $325,000 settlement with the team in a landmark case that settled a long-standing dispute over pay and working conditions. The settlement, which covers the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons, awards each cheerleader $2,500 per season and includes additional payments for photo shoots. Former cheerleader Krystal C., who filed the initial class-action lawsuit in 2014, alleged that the cheerleaders were underpaid and not compensated for practice time.\n\nThe settlement comes after years of legal battles, with the Jets denying the claims and disputing the allegations. The NFL team, however, acknowledged the need to settle to avoid further legal costs and distractions. The settlement amount will be distributed among the cheerleaders based on their time with the team, and those involved in photo shoots will receive extra payments.\n\nSimilar wage disputes have been ongoing in the NFL, with other teams, such as the Buffalo Bills, facing similar lawsuits. These cases challenge the classification of cheerleaders as independent contractors rather than employees, arguing that their pay and benefits should be in line with minimum wage laws. The settlement marks a victory for the cheerleaders, who have received fair compensation for their work, and sets a precedent for other teams to address similar issues.\n\nState Senator Diane Savino, who has advocated for fair pay for cheerleaders, applauded the settlement and called for similar actions from the Buffalo Bills. The NFL has been criticized for its handling of cheerleader contracts, with some teams, like the Bengals and Raiders, already settling with their cheerleaders for significant amounts.\n\nIn summary, the settlement involving the Jets' cheerleaders brings attention to the issue of fair pay for NFL cheerleaders and highlights the ongoing battle to recognize them as employees entitled to minimum wage and other employee benefits. It also underscores the need for the NFL to review and potentially revise its policies regarding cheerleading compensation.", "answers": ["A New Jersey court on Wednesday gave the Flight Crew—aka the New York Jets cheerleaders—something to cheer about: a $325,000 settlement of the class-action lawsuit filed in 2014 by a cheerleader identified as Krystal C., CNNMoney reports.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found them to be inconsistent with a body lying flat, as suggested by the cloth's design. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions and angles of the wounds, comparing them to the bloodstains on the shroud.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the blood flow on the shroud does not match the expected patterns for a person hanging crucified, with rivulets appearing at angles that differ significantly from those on the fabric. For instance, the hand bloodstains showed angles closer to 45 degrees, while the simulated spear wound in the chest had a different pattern. The bloodstains on the shroud also failed to replicate the formation of a rivulet-like pattern that would typically be present in a crucifixion scenario.\n\nThe researchers found that the bloodstains, particularly those on the hands and the \"belt\" at the waist, are more consistent with a standing model, rather than a person hanging from a cross. This inconsistency, combined with the analysis of the cloth's weave and the lack of conclusive evidence for the pigment used, suggests that the shroud might be a medieval representation, rather than a direct depiction of the crucifixion.\n\nWhile the investigation does not definitively prove the shroud's authenticity, it casts doubt on its historical significance and raises questions about the methods used in its creation. The findings have sparked renewed interest in the scientific community and could potentially lead to further forensic analysis in the quest to understand the shroud's true origins and the techniques involved in its production.", "answers": ["The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion; bloodstains on the linen shroud, which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb, form the image of a crucified man.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The first passage introduces the Internet Archive's donation of crawl data to the Wayback Machine, which contributes to the archive's collection of online content. Passage two recounts the author's personal realization about the need to address the injustice of child institutionalization after seeing a disturbing photograph, which inspired her to start writing letters and ultimately founding Lumos.\n\nThe article discusses the root causes of child institutionalization, including poverty, lack of local education and healthcare, and the belief that placing children in institutions is for their best interest. It reveals that the majority of these children have parents who can care for them, but due to various circumstances, they end up in institutions. The negative impacts of institutionalization on children's development, health, and well-being are emphasized, with statistics highlighting the severity of the problem.\n\nLumos, under the leadership of CEO Georgette Mulheir, aims to eradicate child institutionalization globally by 2050 through investments in education, healthcare, and fostering alternatives. The organization's success in countries like Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has significantly decreased, serves as evidence of the feasibility of this goal.\n\nThe article also underscores the moral and economic benefits of ending child institutionalization, as it not only improves the lives of affected children but also saves resources in the long run. The author, J.K. Rowling, has pledged to dedicate her life to this cause, and her involvement with Lumos has led to significant progress in raising awareness and advocating for change.\n\nIn conclusion, the news highlights the urgency of addressing the issue of child institutionalization, the success stories of Lumos in several countries, and the call for global action through the #Letstalklumos campaign, which aims to create a world where such practices are considered outdated and unacceptable.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The site, part of the National Festival of Archaeology, offers insights into the daily life of the inhabitants, with evidence suggesting the structure was likely used for temporary gatherings rather than permanent residency.\n\nThe house, which is one of the best-preserved Neolithic structures in the UK, was found buried under fertile farmland, making it difficult to recognize. The discovery has challenged the perception that Stonehenge is the center of Neolithic importance, with Leary stating that Marden Henge might have been the hub of activity during that era.\n\nIn addition to the house, the site has yielded pig bones, charcoal remains, and a large Roman complex, indicating the presence of both Neolithic and Roman periods. The excavation has provided valuable information about the region's agricultural practices, diet, and the social organization of the community.\n\nThe Marden Henge, with its massive ditch and bank enclosure, was part of a larger structure called Marden Henge, which included a large enclosure and a series of smaller monuments. The site's size, estimated to be 15 hectares, suggests it was likely used for status displays and not practical purposes, as indicated by the lack of a permanent use for the house-like structure.\n\nLeary believes the site's purpose was to showcase wealth and power, with its immense size and the presence of a Roman complex hinting at connections to the region's waterways and the broader historical context. The ongoing excavation, involving professionals and enthusiasts from various parts of the world, aims to uncover more about the site and its connection to the surrounding landscape.\n\nIn parallel, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to be that of a child, was discovered at Wilsford henge, further enriching the understanding of the area's past.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial soda tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding community programs, has faced significant backlash from residents, retailers, and public officials. Formerly hailed as a cutting-edge policy, the tax has been criticized for its high prices, loss of revenue, and negative impact on businesses. The tax, which charges 1.75 cents per ounce, has led to a 64% increase in the cost of sugary beverages like Gatorade at Costco, with customers choosing to purchase elsewhere to avoid the extra charges. The tax has been called regressive, affecting low-income families and causing a decline in sales for affected businesses, including both large chains like Costco and smaller establishments. Seattle's tax has been compared to Cook County's soda tax, which was repealed after public outrage, and the issue of job losses and revenue loss outside the city is emerging. The tax's effectiveness in promoting health or reducing consumption has been questioned, with some arguing that it has instead driven consumers to evade the tax by buying in neighboring areas. The tax has united opponents from various groups, including libertarians, labor unions, and businesses, who see it as a job-killing and revenue-draining measure. A study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University found that three of the top five states with the most regressive laws include Washington, where the tax originated. Meanwhile, in Seattle, a proposed bill to expand the tax to the entire state is being reconsidered, with concerns raised about its potential impact on local businesses.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

She was listed as missing on the California Department of Justice's website due to her absence. However, her whereabouts were discovered when she appeared on \"The Bachelor,\" a popular reality TV show. After her family contacted the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office, she was removed from the missing persons list.\n\n2. **The Bachelor Connection**: Martinez's sister, Amy O'Brien, recognized her on the North Coast Journal's \"The Humboldt 35\" list and alerted authorities about her on \"The Bachelor.\" This led to her removal from the missing persons database.\n\n3. **Missing Person's Case**: Despite being found on TV, Martinez's case highlights the issue of missing persons in Humboldt County. The county has a high rate of missing persons, with 313 cases listed in 2016, despite the AG's database. Factors include a lack of cooperation from missing individuals, transient populations, and the high number of children in foster care.\n\n4. **Local Media Attention**: The story of the missing person in the local newspaper, \"The Humboldt 35,\" sparked a discussion about the high number of missing persons in the county. This raised questions about the reasons behind the high rate, including the possibility of a lack of resources and the influence of the cannabis industry.\n\n5. **Private Life and Community Dynamics**: Some individuals who are reported missing in Humboldt County may be doing so voluntarily due to personal reasons, like estrangement or choosing to isolate themselves. Law enforcement acknowledges that some cases are difficult to investigate due to limited information and the involvement of the cannabis industry.\n\n6. **National Database Comparison**: The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) and the Attorney General's database differ in terms of inclusion, with some cases not reaching the federal system. This highlights the need for standardization in reporting and the importance of a national database for missing persons.\n\nIn conclusion, the story of Rebekah Martinez's disappearance and the broader context of missing persons in Humboldt County raises questions about the challenges of tracking and locating missing individuals,", "answers": ["It turns out missing people are pretty easy to find when they appear every week in your living room.

According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people.

The app, according to Arias, violated her privacy and was compared to an ankle bracelet, leading to an invasion of privacy and potential retaliation. She seeks damages and claims the company violated privacy, retaliation, and unfair business practices.\n\n2.

Employees can use the app to record their activities, receive job assignments, and communicate with the office. The app is available on multiple devices and costs a monthly fee. Intermex provides support and training for its users.\n\n3. The third news item discusses the importance of customer satisfaction in service industries, emphasizing the need to deliver excellent service to retain customers. It does not directly relate to the legal issue in the first article but highlights the connection between customer service and business success.\n\n4. In a separate case, Intermex, a company that requires employees to use a GPS-tracking app, is facing a lawsuit from a former employee who claims the constant monitoring violated her privacy and was a violation of labor laws. The company has not yet commented on the matter.\n\nIn summary, these news stories revolve around employee privacy concerns, workplace monitoring, and the legal implications of such practices. Both Intermex and the employee's attorney are actively pursuing legal action, with the latter seeking damages and relief for alleged privacy violations and wrongful termination.

{"pred": "In this collection of news articles, the focus centers on Donald Trump's campaign, its recent shake-up, and the public's perception of its performance. Here's a summary:\n\n1. Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer, made headlines for his awkward response to CNN's Brianna Keilar when she mentioned that Trump's campaign is down in the polls. Cohen questioned the validity of the polls, repeating \"Says who?\" several times, seemingly dismissing the poll results.\n\n2. Cohen initially defended Trump's understanding of the African American issue during the Milwaukee riots, acknowledging the existence of racial tensions but stating that Trump is \"colourblind.\" His response to the poll question was seen as dismissive and out of touch with reality, causing a rift with the interviewer.\n\n3. The shake-up in Trump's campaign includes the addition of Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager and Steve Bannon as chief executive officer. Cohen, in an interview, denied that this was a shake-up but when pressed, he admitted that the campaign was now ready for these changes.\n\n4. Cohen's response to the polls, characterized as \"Says who?\" on air, has sparked social media buzz with the hashtag #SaysWho? becoming a trending topic. Twitter users are mocking Cohen's repeated question and the campaign's struggling poll numbers.\n\n5.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The Neiman Marcus breach, which began as early as July 2020, involved the theft of customer payment card information but did not compromise sensitive personal data such as Social Security numbers or birth dates. Neiman Marcus initially kept the details of the attack under wraps, facing criticism for not disclosing the incident sooner. The company later acknowledged the breach and stated that it had taken steps to notify affected customers.\n\nTarget, on the other hand, suffered a larger and more significant data breach in which credit and debit card numbers, as well as PINs, were stolen from 100 million customers. The breach was attributed to a malware attack, described as \"new to eCrime\" and executed with \"innovation and skill,\" using software from the Russian-language underground. The report from the company hired to investigate, iSight, indicates that the operation was part of a broader international hacking campaign targeting multiple retailers.\n\nBoth Neiman Marcus and Target have defended their decision to keep the breaches under wraps, Neiman Marcus arguing that they needed to confirm evidence before making an announcement. However, the report from the investigation into Target revealed that the attack was part of a coordinated effort, potentially connected to a larger, international operation.\n\nAs a result of the breaches, Neiman Marcus and Target have faced scrutiny for their handling of the situation, with some questioning why Neiman Marcus waited so long to disclose the breach.

This report suggests that the attack was part of a larger, ongoing campaign, but does not attribute responsibility to specific individuals due to the ongoing US government investigation.\n\nOverall, these breaches highlight the growing concern of cybercrime and the evolving tactics employed by hackers, emphasizing the need for retailers and financial institutions to improve their security measures and communicate promptly with customers in such incidents.", "answers": ["It looks like the hackers that hit Target had lots of other, well, targets.

A lead vessel containing ashes from John's alleged grave, believed to date back to the 6th century, was found in a reliquary within an early Christian basilica. The discovery, made at the ancient fortress site of Poros (also known as Burgas), has sparked interest due to its connection to the revered saint, who was highly venerated for his healing properties.\n\nThe reliquary, now housed in the Burgas Regional Museum of History, is adorned with religious symbols and is seen as a sacred possession. Alongside the relic, archaeologists also discovered a 10th-century Bulgarian royal seal, suggesting the importance of the site for early Christians. The discovery challenges the limited number of lead tube reliquaries known worldwide, which were primarily used for carrying holy water.\n\nThe lead tube containing John the Apostle's ashes is a small, 2.2 cm (less than an inch) long container, and its presence in the 6th-century basilica indicates the significance of the site as a pilgrimage destination for early Christians. The discovery was likely made by a pilgrim from Cape Foros, who later donated the relic to the basilica upon their return.\n\nArchaeologists believe that the lead tube reliquary might have been brought from the pilgrimage center in Ephesus, Turkey, where John's grave is also located. The discovery at Burgas adds to the list of early Christian pilgrimage centers, including those in Egypt, Antioch, and elsewhere, that had their own lead tube reliquaries.\n\nThe lead tube's connection to the annual pilgrimage tradition on May 8, when it is believed that manna, a form of miraculous healing powder, would appear on the site, highlights the religious significance of the find.

The lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, emphasizes the importance of maintaining weight loss after dieting to avoid these negative health consequences.\n\nPassage 2 provides a general overview of coronary artery disease (CAD), explaining that it occurs when the coronary arteries, which supply the heart with blood, become narrowed due to cholesterol deposits and inflammation. CAD can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and potentially life-threatening events if not managed properly. The passage also mentions that a healthy lifestyle can play a crucial role in preventing and managing CAD.\n\nPassage 3 focuses on a recent study that found yo-yo dieting, or weight cycling, in individuals with CAD could lead to more severe health consequences, including a 124% increased risk of death, heart attacks, and strokes. The study, conducted by researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center, suggests that even small weight fluctuations can have significant impacts on heart health. However, the study is observational and does not establish causality.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the negative effects of yo-yo dieting on heart health, particularly in individuals with CAD. It underscores the need to maintain weight loss and emphasizes the potential risks associated with weight fluctuations, even for those with pre-existing heart conditions. Further research is suggested to better understand the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to prevent these health complications.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another. And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

According to an analysis of data from the University of Michigan, one in seven colorectal cancer patients is now under 50, with a growing number diagnosed at a younger age. This shift has implications for screening guidelines, as younger patients tend to have more aggressive forms of the disease but also see better survival rates when diagnosed.\n\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data revealed that younger patients, particularly those under 50, are more likely to have distant-stage tumors, which are more aggressive and have higher mortality rates. However, they are also more likely to receive more aggressive treatments, such as surgery for distant rectal cancer, compared to their older counterparts.\n\nYounger patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer have a higher likelihood of receiving radiation therapy, particularly for rectal cancer, which could contribute to their improved survival rates despite the advanced stage at diagnosis. Despite these positive outcomes, the study by Cancer researchers suggests that nearly 15% of all colorectal cases are diagnosed in individuals below 50, indicating a need for improved risk assessment and screening strategies.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, calls for a reevaluation of the recommended age for starting screening, suggesting that nearly 5% of colorectal cancers in younger patients could be missed if age 50 remains the standard. However, experts like Dr. Andrew Chan from Harvard Medical School caution against altering screening guidelines too soon, pointing to the potential risks and the need for further research.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients necessitates a closer examination of current screening guidelines and risk factors, as early detection and appropriate treatment can significantly impact survival rates.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The site contained evidence of human activity, including fire-making, with burnt rock art and a blackened roof suggesting the use of fire for warmth and possibly for cooking.\n\nExcavations uncovered sophisticated tools, including bone fragments from the largest ever known marsupial, and a range of artifacts that indicate the presence of early human technologies like bone tools and ochre use. The site's age, around 49,000 years, pushes back the timeline of human settlement in Australia, suggesting a possible earlier colonization than previously thought. The site also contained evidence of human interaction with megafauna, such as the bones of the extinct Diprotodon optatum and the presence of burnt eggshells, indicating coexistence and possibly hunting.\n\nThe findings challenge the assumption that human settlement in the arid interior of Australia was solely driven by climate, as the site's location in the Flinders Ranges suggests that people were able to adapt and survive in the region even during periods of harsh climate. The study, led by La Trobe University's Giles Hamm, also revealed the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and the development of local technological innovations.\n\nThe dating of the site, particularly the bone tools and ochre use, is based on a combination of techniques, including optical dating of quartz grains and carbon dating of artifacts, providing a more precise understanding of the site's chronology. The findings challenge the traditional narrative of human migration into the arid interior and highlight the ingenuity and adaptability of the earliest Australians.\n\nThe study, published in Nature, contributes to the ongoing debate about the timing and methods of human colonization in Australia, with the Warratyi site offering a glimpse into the complex and diverse prehistory of the continent. The research underscores the importance of considering local cultural evolution and the role of indigenous knowledge in shaping early human interactions with the environment.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "The news articles discuss various aspects of interstellar exploration, energy consumption, and the possibility of detecting advanced alien civilizations. The first passage introduces a model proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, which suggests three stages of technological advancement: gathering resources from a planet, a nearby star, and eventually, all stars in a galaxy. The paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds a new twist to this concept, suggesting that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for survival as the universe expands and makes stars inaccessible. Hooper argues that advanced civilizations would actively seek to capture and harvest stars before they become unobtainable due to the expanding universe's horizon.\n\nIn the realm of science fiction, the idea of capturing stars through massive structures like Dyson spheres or statites is explored. Dyson spheres, as proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson, involve a swarm of satellites to collect solar energy and convert it into usable resources. These structures, though challenging to construct, could potentially identify advanced alien civilizations through their waste heat signature.\n\nThe article \"WARCZone\" mentions outsider-uploaded WARCs, which are not directly part of the Wayback Machine but are stored for reference and accessibility. The search for alien civilizations is also discussed, with the understanding that advanced ones would likely be resourceful and adapt to the limitations imposed by the expanding universe.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the importance of energy harvesting for survival in the face of universal expansion, the potential detection methods through unique light signatures, and the speculative concept of advanced civilizations using Dyson spheres or similar structures to secure their energy sources. The search for alien life is intertwined with the study of the universe's evolution and the challenges faced by future civilizations.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

{"pred": "The news articles cover various aspects of ancient human history and technological advancements, particularly in the context of the East African region. Here's a summary of the main findings:\n\n1. A study published in Science suggests that climate-driven changes in the region may have led to the development of tool-making innovations and trading networks among early Homo sapiens or their relatives around 320,000 years ago. This includes the use of larger, more specialized tools for foraging over unpredictable landscapes and the discovery of obsidian tools from distant sources, indicating long-distance communication and trading.\n\n2. The Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya, where these tools were found, revealed a shift in tool technology around 320,000 years ago. The tools, including hand axes and smaller, more specialized ones, suggest a response to changing environmental conditions, such as frequent climate shifts between wet and dry periods.\n\n3. The tools, including the use of obsidian, indicate the potential for trading networks among early humans, as evidenced by the presence of tools made from distant sources. This supports the hypothesis that long-distance communication and cooperation were crucial for survival during challenging environmental conditions.\n\n4. The shift to Middle Stone Age tools challenges the traditional view that the emergence of modern behaviors, like tool-making and possibly complex language, occurred after Homo sapiens left Africa. The new studies suggest that these behaviors may have started as early as 300,000 years ago, with evidence of technological and cultural adaptations to changing landscapes.\n\n5. The research also highlights the importance of long-term environmental changes, such as climate shifts, in driving these behavioral and technological changes. The presence of obsidian and other exotic materials suggests the development of social networks and possibly the beginnings of complex communication.\n\n6. The findings challenge the notion of a sudden \"human revolution\" that occurred outside Africa, as some researchers argue that modern behaviors, like art and symbolism, were present in the African Stone Age, particularly in the Olorgesailie Basin.\n\nIn summary, these studies reveal a gradual and complex process of adaptation and innovation among early humans in response to environmental changes, hinting at the roots of modern human behaviors and social networks that extended back to the Middle Stone Age.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

His net worth, which was $10.8 million at the time of the 1994 divorce settlement, has significantly declined due to legal judgments and financial obligations, including a $33.5 million civil settlement for the 1994 murders. Simpson's parole hearing is expected to generate significant media attention, with many people curious about his behavior and potential change since his time in prison.\n\nSimpson's parole hearing is considered a formality, and if approved, he could be released as early as Oct. 1. However, his chances of parole are considered favorable due to his good behavior in prison and the possibility of a parole decision being announced immediately. If released, Simpson's NFL pension would be protected, but his ability to access or protect other assets, such as the rights to his confessional book \"If I Did It,\" would be limited.\n\nThe release of Simpson, who has been a public fascination for over two decades, would likely spark renewed interest and debate, with many people divided over his guilt and the impact of the 1995 murder trial. Simpson's friend and defense attorney, Tom Scotto, advises him to avoid returning to the spotlight and instead focus on rebuilding his life quietly to avoid further negative attention.\n\nIn the past, Simpson's parole hearings have been marked by media frenzy, and this time, the board has decided to expedite the decision, anticipating potential disruptions.

This move is aimed at reducing the impact of marijuana possession on the island's residents, particularly young people, and addresses the historical issue of criminalizing Rastafarians for religious use.\n\nThe legislation also allows for tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad to obtain permits to legally purchase small amounts of marijuana, while national security minister Peter Bunting emphasized that the government will not tolerate transnational drug trafficking or the cultivation of illegal plots. The cannabis licensing authority, once established, will regulate the industry, ensuring compliance with international treaty obligations.\n\nDespite this, the government maintains a strong stance against drug trafficking, with national security minister Bunting stating that the law does not signal a relaxation of the fight against drug trafficking.

A team from NASA, using powerful telescopes, found that a massive ocean covering around 20% of the northern hemisphere, similar to Earth's Atlantic, existed 4.5 billion years ago. The water was estimated to be up to 137 meters deep, with a global ocean covering the entire planet, or about 13% of its surface. The high concentration of deuterium, a heavier form of hydrogen, indicates that Mars lost a substantial amount of water over time, with some basins showing a deuteration level up to 8 times Earth's standard (VSMOW).\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, used data from the Keck II telescope, the Infrared Telescope Facility, and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope to map Martian atmospheric water and its deuterium content. The high deuterium enrichment suggests that Mars had a global equivalent of a 137-meter thick water layer during its early history, which raises the possibility of past habitability.\n\nNASA's Curiosity rover has already shown that Mars had standing water for a longer period than previously thought, supporting the idea that the planet could have been hospitable to life. However, the exact amount of water and the distribution across the planet are still being debated, with some researchers suggesting that the actual water volume may have been much larger due to a higher initial deuterium content.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean adds to the growing understanding of Mars' complex history, challenging the previous belief that water was scarce and intermittent on the planet. The presence of deuterium-enriched water in the polar regions and the potential for a global ocean during early Mars raises the intriguing possibility of past microbial life on the red planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states.

The plane's black box and the challenge of unpredictable ocean currents made the search difficult, but Bayesian methods allowed the team to update their probability models as new information came in. In the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian statistics led to the discovery of the wreckage after a Bayesian analysis adjusted the search parameters.\n\nIn summary, both news pieces highlight the role of Bayesian statistics in complex search operations, particularly in the context of missing aircraft. Bayesian inference, by allowing for the integration of new information and the updating of probability distributions, has proven useful in locating submerged objects and solving mysteries like the disappearance of Air France Flight 447 and the current search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. However, the second passage also acknowledges the limitations of Bayesian methods when faced with significant changes in the situation, as seen in the case of Malaysia Airlines, where the plane's probable cause of disappearance changed the focus of the search.

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises. Not in an ideal viewing area? The Virtual Telescope plans to livestream the total eclipse from Australia, which you can watch here, per Quartz.

According to a recent study published in the Lancet, the United States leads the world in obesity, with 13% of the population being obese, despite having only 5% of the global population. However, the problem is not unique to the US, as obesity rates are rising globally, with no country seeing a decline in the past three decades.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data from 1980 to 2013, reveals that obesity is a growing concern in many countries, particularly in the Middle East, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean regions. Some countries, like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, have seen staggering obesity rates, especially among men. In contrast, wealthy countries like the US and Kuwait have high obesity rates, with men experiencing higher increases compared to women.\n\nThe rise in obesity is not limited to developed nations, as it is also affecting poorer countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that obesity is a major risk factor for various health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. The global obesity rate has increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013, with about 30% of the world's population now considered overweight or obese.\n\nThe study's authors, from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, emphasize that no country has successfully reduced obesity rates over the past three decades. The problem is particularly severe in children, with obesity rates rising globally, affecting both rich and poor nations. The report suggests that a combination of factors, including increased calorie intake, sedentary lifestyles, and changes in diet, contribute to the obesity crisis.\n\nWhile the US and some developed countries have seen slower rates of obesity growth in recent years, the overall trend is still rising.

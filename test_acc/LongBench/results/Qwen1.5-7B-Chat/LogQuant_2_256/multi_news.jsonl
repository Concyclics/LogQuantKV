{"pred": "Two recent studies, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, reveal the harmful effects of cigarette smoke on antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Researchers from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine found that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resilience of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and causing it to evade immune defenses.\n\nIn the first study, researchers discovered that cigarette smoke extract, when encountered by MRSA, triggers a change in the bacteria's cell walls, reducing its susceptibility to immune responses. Specifically, MRSA exposed to smoke becomes less responsive to reactive oxygen species, which are essential for macrophages to kill invading bacteria. This adaptation allows MRSA to survive and replicate more effectively, adhering better to human cells and becoming more resistant to antimicrobial peptides.\n\nThe study also revealed that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more than four times more resistant to macrophage killing and showed a 24-hour persistence of the increased resistance, even after exposure. In mice experiments, the researchers observed that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more lethal and invasive in human cells, highlighting the potential for the bacteria to cause more severe infections.\n\nThese findings echo a previous study by the same research group, which showed that e-cigarette vapor also affects MRSA, making it more resistant. However, the current study indicates that cigarette smoke has a stronger impact, with smoke-exposed MRSA showing a 10-fold increase in surface changes that contribute to its resistance.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, emphasize the significance of this discovery, as it suggests that cigarette smoking not only poses risks to smokers but also exacerbates the problem by making MRSA more resilient. They recommend that individuals should avoid smoking to reduce the risk of not only respiratory issues but also the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nIn summary, cigarette smoke acts as a catalyst for MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and enhancing its ability to evade the immune system. This increased resistance not only affects hospital patients but also poses a threat to the general population, emphasizing the importance of quitting smoking to combat this growing public health concern.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found them to be inconsistent with a body lying flat, suggesting the blood could not have been transferred in the way typically associated with the crucifixion wounds of Jesus. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions and angles, comparing them to the bloodstains on the shroud.

This finding challenges the traditional understanding that a person on a cross would leave a distinctive blood pattern on the cloth.

The charity emphasizes that the majority of these children have loving parents, and the issue is often exacerbated by a lack of understanding and resources in their communities.\n\nThe article highlights the harrowing conditions in many institutions, with children suffering from malnutrition, abuse, and psychological trauma. The organization's CEO, Georgette Mulheir, shares the shocking statistic that 8 million children worldwide are separated from their families, and the global eradication of institutionalization is achievable through investments in education, healthcare, and fostering alternatives.\n\nLumos' success stories, such as a 70% decrease in institutionalized children in Moldova and a 75% drop in admissions in certain countries, demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. The author underscores the importance of international donors, particularly the EU, the US, and the Global Alliance for Children, in supporting these initiatives.\n\nThe launch of the #Letstalklumos campaign, led by Rowling, aims to raise awareness about the issue and encourage public engagement. The commitment to addressing this problem is not just a moral imperative but also a strategic move towards reducing the long-term negative impacts of institutionalization on children's development and well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, Lumos, led by J.K. Rowling, is working tirelessly to end the practice of child institutionalization by advocating for family-based care, highlighting the consequences of institutionalization, and collaborating with donors to create a brighter future for millions of children.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them. Rowling wants to change that, not by improving these orphanages with \"pretty murals\" or teddy bears, but by eliminating them altogether, she writes in the Guardian. The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

The PCTA reports a 300% increase in trail inquiries and permit requests since the release of \"Wild.\" The trail, which typically sees only around 3,346 completed through-hikes since its inception in the 1950s, is now attracting more than 4,000 through-hikers in 2016, with 500 planned for the southern part of the trail and a similar number for the northern portion.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The tax has been criticized for its regressiveness, hitting low-income families harder, and for not addressing all sugary drinks, like those sold at Starbucks.

The tax's failure in Chicago's suburbs, where sales dropped, and a subsequent repeal in Cook County, Illinois, highlights the issue's negative impact on local economies.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

However, Senate Democrats have refused to accept changes to the ACA, viewing it as a political issue. Boehner aims to appease conservative House Republicans who want to delay or scrap the ACA, while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is urging a tough stance, refusing to negotiate on the health care law. If the House passes the bill with ACA provisions, Senate Democrats are expected to reject it, leading to a government shutdown. The Senate has no plans to meet until Monday, allowing limited time for a resolution.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The discovery, published in the Astronomical Journal, has sparked excitement among some astronomers, who argue that it could reshape our understanding of the solar system's formation.\n\nMichael Brown, known as \"Pluto Killer\" due to his role in the demotion of Pluto from the official planet list, believes that Planet Nine's existence is solid and could potentially replace Pluto in the history books.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

In a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a site dating back 49,000 years has been found, revealing evidence of human activity, including the use of fire, stone tools, and ochre, as well as the presence of megafauna bones. The discovery challenges the commonly accepted timeline of human arrival in Australia, suggesting a possible earlier colonization, around 55,000 years ago, rather than the 50,000-year consensus. The site at Warratyi, with its 4,300 artifacts and 200 bone fragments, supports the use of stone axes and ochre, pushing the development of these technologies back by thousands of years.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial.

The paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds a new twist to this concept, suggesting that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for survival as the universe expands and makes stars inaccessible.

The show initially focused on lampooning local news and the conventions of the time, using humor to criticize the pop culture and lifestyle aspects of news coverage. Jon Stewart took over the show in 1998, and under his leadership, the tone shifted to be more pointed, with a focus on critiquing political figures and media. The show's correspondents, including Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, and others, were recruited based on their ability to perform in scenes and their compatibility with Stewart's vision. The show's success led to a rise in the correspondent's careers, with Carell's segment on the 1999 New Hampshire primary, in which he impersonated a reporter and asked a controversial question, becoming a memorable moment. The Daily Show's influence grew, leading to Steve Carell's character being sued for falsely claiming to be from CNN, highlighting the challenges of balancing comedy with truth in political satire.

{"pred": "The news articles cover various aspects of human evolution and stone age tool-making in Africa. The first passage discusses a study revealing that dramatic climate shifts during the Middle Stone Age (MSA) around 320,000 years ago might have driven Homo sapiens and their relatives to develop tool-making advancements and trading networks. The tools found in the Olorgesailie Basin, Kenya, include larger, older tools for foraging in unpredictable environments and smaller, specialized tools made from obsidian, suggesting long-distance trading and the potential for cooperation among early humans. The tools, particularly the obsidian, indicate the existence of trading networks, possibly involving closely related species or early Homo sapiens.\n\nThe second passage updates the scientific community on the discovery of advanced stone tools in the Olorgesailie Basin, dating back to 320,000 years ago, which challenges previous estimates and suggests a continuous tool-making trend influenced by climate variability. The tools, including hand axes and Middle Stone Age implements, suggest a shift from more primitive tools to a more specialized and technologically sophisticated system, possibly indicating the emergence of early trade and social networking.\n\nThe third passage highlights the significance of the Olorgesailie discoveries, with hand axes transitioning to Middle Stone Age tools, which were likely used for hunting and possibly signaling the development of trading networks. The study attributes the shift to long-term environmental changes, such as droughts and earthquakes, that forced early humans to adapt and expand their territories.\n\nThe fourth passage disputes the traditional view of a sudden \"human revolution\" around 40,000-50,000 years ago, arguing that modern behaviors, such as art and symbolism, were present in the African stone age, specifically in the Olorgesailie Basin, around 300,000 years ago. This evidence challenges the idea that modern behaviors emerged solely after Homo sapiens left Africa and suggests a more complex and gradual process of cultural and technological evolution.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the significant shift in stone age tool-making and the development of trading networks among early humans in Africa, particularly in the Olorgesailie Basin, around 320,000 years ago. These findings challenge the traditional narrative of a sudden human revolution and emphasize the importance of environmental pressures and long-distance communication in shaping human behavior and technological advancements.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it?

The argument is that wired audio, particularly the popular Bose QuietComfort headphones, often sound better than Apple's proprietary AirPods or the iPhone's own wireless options.\n\nSchiller's explanation for the decision, citing space constraints and the desire for stereo speakers and Taptic engines, has been mocked on social media. Many users, like Chris Taylor, point out that the lack of a universal standard for headphones is inconvenient, especially for those who rely on wired headphones or have multiple devices that plug into the iPhone's jack.\n\nThe reaction to the new iPhone models without a 3.5mm jack ranges from anger and frustration to sarcastic commentary, with some users suggesting that Apple has prioritized proprietary solutions (like AirPods) over user convenience.

The airline has moved from using five boarding lanes to two, with priority passengers in groups 1 and 2 using lane 1 and non-preceding groups using lane 2. This change, which has been in testing since June, aims to streamline the boarding process by reducing idle time at gates and improving communication for passengers with the United Airlines mobile app. The airline is also introducing push notifications for customers with the app, allowing them to be informed of flight updates, including delays or early boarding. This update follows a trend of airlines experimenting with boarding methods to optimize efficiency and reduce stress for passengers.\n\nIn addition to the boarding changes, United Airlines has reached an agreement with Copa Airlines and other airlines, including Compañía Panameña de Aviación S.A. (Copa) and Aerovias del Continente Americano S.A. (Avianca), for a joint business agreement (JBA) that aims to improve service and competition in the Central and South America market.

NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

On November 15, the Israeli cabinet authorized the mobilization of up to 75,000 reservists, indicating a potential invasion of Gaza following the first rocket attack on Jerusalem in decades. This move came after days of rocket attacks on both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, with no significant casualties on the Israeli side but several deaths in Gaza, including civilians and Hamas fighters.\n\nHamas, the ruling group in Gaza, claimed responsibility for the attacks on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Egypt's prime minister, Hisham Kandil, visited Gaza to denounce Israeli aggression but failed to secure a truce, as the three-hour ceasefire agreed upon during his visit did not hold. Israel's defense forces intercepted and destroyed numerous rockets, while also conducting airstrikes in Gaza.\n\nThe situation escalated further with the announcement of a possible ground invasion by Israel, causing concern for both political and civilian stability. The United States called on countries with ties to Hamas to pressure the group to stop rocket attacks, while Egypt's President, Mohamed Morsi, ordered his prime minister to visit Gaza as a show of solidarity and to mediate the conflict. The US Secretary of State, Mark Toner, emphasized the need for Hamas to stop the rocket attacks, and the US and European countries expressed support for Israel's actions.\n\nThe conflict has raised tensions in the region, with the Nonaligned Movement, a group of 120 nations, condemning Israel's actions and calling for a UN resolution. The US, through its envoy, has urged both sides to de-escalate the situation, with the understanding that Egypt's new leadership under Mohammed Morsi presents a crucial opportunity for diplomacy.\n\nIn summary, the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has escalated, with both sides exchanging airstrikes and rocket attacks. The situation remains tense, with the possibility of a ground invasion by Israel and the involvement of regional powers like Egypt and the US in attempting to mediate and de-escalate the conflict. The conflict has caused significant loss of life and has raised concerns about the future of the region's stability.", "answers": ["A brief, planned ceasefire failed to materialize in Gaza today, as death continued to rain down on the strip.

A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times. Israel has now hit 250 Gaza targets, while taking further steps toward a ground invasion, calling up 16,000 reservists, the Wall Street Journal reports. It's also steadily sending troops and armored vehicles to the border, notes CNN—between 1,500 and 2,000 are already there, one official said. Israel claims the attacks have weakened Hamas' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but Hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple Israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with Hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new Egyptian regime would be more active in helping the Palestinians. \"The time has changed,\" he said. \"No longer the Israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the Palestinians without being held responsible.

{"pred": "In recent news, scientists have discovered significant evidence of a large ancient ocean on Mars, challenging the long-held belief that the planet was largely dry and uninhabitable. A massive body of water, covering nearly half of the northern hemisphere, existed around 4.5 billion years ago, comparable to the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. The ocean, which was 100 million cubic kilometers in size, was a result of a warm and wet climate, with temperatures high enough to support liquid water.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, used advanced telescopes to analyze the Martian atmosphere and found that water molecules contained a higher concentration of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, indicating that a significant amount of water had been lost over time. The high deuterium content suggests that Mars once had a global ocean layer up to 137 meters deep, with some basins and high-altitude regions showing even higher enrichments in deuterium.\n\nThis discovery challenges previous understanding of Mars' water history, as it implies that the planet had conditions more favorable for life than previously thought. The presence of a global ocean on Mars raises the possibility of past habitability, with Mars potentially having hosted a more extensive period of liquid water than the current 1.5 billion years of evidence from the Mars rover Curiosity suggests.\n\nMethane on Mars, detected by the Curiosity rover, has also been linked to the planet's past habitability, although the exact origin and persistence of methane remain uncertain. The combination of these findings strengthens the case for further exploration and the search for signs of past or present life on Mars.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights Mars as a more promising location for ancient life, with a vast ocean that persisted for millions of years, and the ongoing search for definitive evidence of past habitability on the Red Planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

In a groundbreaking experiment, researchers were able to map the brain patterns of subjects as they watched movie trailers and create a continuous, albeit blurry, representation of the videos. This is the first time that scientists have successfully reconstructed a dynamic visual experience from brain patterns, bypassing the need for visual stimulation.\n\nThe study involved subjects lying motionless in an MRI machine, with their brain activity linked to specific visual elements in the videos. By analyzing the flow of blood to the visual cortex, the researchers developed a computer algorithm that could match brain patterns to YouTube content. This allowed them to reconstruct the videos, offering a glimpse into the \"movies\" playing in participants' minds.\n\nThe reconstructed videos, though continuous, are not yet clear enough to read thoughts or dreams directly.

Bayesian methods, developed by statisticians, help refine and update search strategies in complex situations like the missing plane mystery. These techniques involve analyzing probabilities of finding the plane in different locations based on available data, such as flight paths, weather conditions, and potential causes of the disappearance.\n\nIn the case of Flight 370, Bayesian analysis has been used to shift the focus from the initial search areas due to new information suggesting a deliberate act, making it less likely to find the plane in certain regions. Bayesian statisticians, like those from Metron Scientific Solutions, employ a rigorous approach to incorporate expert judgment and adapt to changing circumstances, as seen in the Air France search where Bayesian calculations were crucial in adjusting the search strategy.\n\nHowever, the article also highlights limitations of Bayesian methods in extreme situations, like the Malaysia Airlines case, where the plane's disappearance is believed to be more likely due to a crash, not a deliberate act. Statisticians like Colleen Keller caution that Bayesian techniques might not be as effective when the situation changes drastically, as in this case, where the focus shifts from a plane in the air to one at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThe search for Air France Flight 447, involving Bayesian methods, led to the successful recovery of the wreckage, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. However, the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, despite Bayesian calculations, remains challenging due to the complexity of the situation and the need to account for new evidence and adjustments.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayesian statistics, while valuable in refining search strategies, face challenges when dealing with significant changes in the situation, as seen in the different outcomes of the Air France and Malaysia Airlines searches.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

Researchers from the University of California, San Diego, and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System found that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA to antibiotics, making it more difficult to treat and causing it to become more aggressive.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, shows that cigarette smoke extract hampers the immune system's ability to fight off MRSA, as it stresses the bacteria and makes them less susceptible to the immune cells' defenses. Specifically, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke becomes more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are crucial for combating bacterial infections. The research also indicates that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA is more likely to adhere to human cells, enhancing its survival and infectivity.\n\nCrotty Alexander's team observed that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing and 24 hours after exposure, the bacteria still retained some of their increased resistance. This persistence could lead to increased transmission and survival in the environment, as the bacteria were more successful in mice that were infected with smoke-exposed MRSA.\n\nThe study findings suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also aids in the survival and aggression of MRSA, contributing to increased infections and potentially higher mortality rates. This is particularly concerning as e-cigarette vapor has also been shown to increase MRSA resistance, although the smoke from cigarettes appears to have a stronger effect on the bacteria's cell walls and resistance.

The analysis revealed that most significant historical figures were born in Western countries after the 17th century and were predominantly male, with a bias towards local figures due to cultural connections.\n\nEom's team used Google's PageRank algorithm, which assigns importance based on the number of links pointing to a page, to initially rank individuals. However, this method was found to be flawed when applied to Linnaeus, as his extensive work in taxonomy led to numerous links from and to other pages, making him appear more influential.\n\nTo address this issue, the researchers employed a modified ranking method called CheiRank, which considers both incoming and outgoing links, revealing that Linnaeus' influence was driven by the sheer volume of scientific names on Wikipedia. This ranking system, 2DRank, was developed to correct for the anomalies in the original analysis.\n\nIn summary, the study suggests that Wikipedia, as an online encyclopedia, may skew its attention towards certain fields and historical figures, with Linnaeus emerging as the most influential figure due to the nature of the content it hosts.

The disease, known as acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), affects the spinal cord and can be caused by various viruses, including enteroviruses and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. In 2014, a link was suggested between a strain of enterovirus, likely EV-D68, and a surge in AFM cases, but the CDC has not detected the virus in recent years in cases of AFM.\n\nThe symptoms of AFM include muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and facial drooping. There is currently no specific cure for the disease, and treatment is often focused on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. Enterovirus D68, though, was previously associated with a higher risk of AFM, but the current outbreak does not seem to be linked to this strain.\n\nIn 2014, the condition affected mostly young children, with the average age being 7, and some required ventilation support. The CDC is urging parents and healthcare providers to practice good hygiene, such as hand washing, to prevent the spread of the virus. Parents of affected children, like Carter Roberts, have expressed concern about the lack of information available, with some cases like his taking a child from a healthy, active child to a paralyzed one almost overnight.\n\nEnterovirus infections are common in the summer, and the current rise in AFM cases could be a sign of a heightened awareness and better reporting, or a real increase in the incidence of the disease. Researchers and health officials are working to identify the cause of the recent surge, with some suspecting a connection to the recent enterovirus outbreak, while others maintain that more research is needed.\n\nParents and healthcare providers are advised to be vigilant and report any suspected cases to the CDC.

Researchers, Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used forensic techniques to analyze the bloodstains on the cloth, known as Bloodstain Pattern Analysis. Their findings indicate that the blood patterns are inconsistent with a person lying flat, as seen in the Shroud, suggesting the image could not have been made by a body in that position.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found that the blood on the cloth, which contains iron oxide possibly from pigment or blood, does not match the position of wounds consistent with the crucifixion wounds of Jesus as described in religious tradition. The researchers tested various positions, such as a standing mannequin with blood flowing from different angles, and concluded that the angles of the rivulets on the shroud do not align with those expected for a person on a cross.\n\nOne particularly striking inconsistency is the \"blood belt\" at the waist, which the researchers were unable to replicate, even with a model in different positions. These findings, combined with the inconsistent blood flow on the back of the hand and the lack of a solid blood stain on the supposed wound location, argue against the authenticity of the shroud's bloodstains.\n\nWhile the Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, this investigation raises questions about the shroud's origin and the techniques used to create the image on the cloth. The researchers suggest that the bloodstains are more consistent with a standing model, casting doubt on the traditional view that the cloth represents the crucifixion of Jesus. The study's results highlight the need for further scientific analysis to determine the shroud's true origin and authenticity.", "answers": ["The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion; bloodstains on the linen shroud, which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb, form the image of a crucified man.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Rowling, the founder and president of Lumos, an organization dedicated to ending the practice of separating children from their families and placing them in institutions. In 1996, the internet archive's crawl data, donated by Alexa Internet, were added to the Wayback Machine after a embargo period. The founder of Lumos, inspired by a photograph of a child in an institution, began writing letters to influential individuals, leading to the establishment of the charity and its mission to shed light on the plight of millions of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination.\n\nLumos' CEO, Georgette Mulheir, shares the harrowing reality of these institutions, describing them as \"nightmarish\" with inadequate living conditions and severe consequences for children's development. The issue of child institutionalization affects 8 million children worldwide, with the majority being in institutions due to lack of adequate care and support in their homes. The root cause is often a belief that institutionalization is for the child's best interest, but Lumos argues that the majority of these children have loving parents and that the solution lies in investing in inclusive education, healthcare, and fostering alternatives.\n\nLumos has seen significant progress in countries like Moldova, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70% since their involvement, and the Czech Republic, where there has been a 75% decline in admissions. The organization emphasizes that ending this practice not only has moral but also economic benefits, as it is more cost-effective to support children in their families than in institutions.\n\nThe global community, including public and private donors, has a crucial role to play in addressing this issue, with the United Nations and the Global Alliance for Children committing to reducing the number of children in institutions. Lumos aims to eradicate this practice by 2050, and their work has already led to substantial improvements in countries like Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has dropped significantly.\n\nIn conclusion, the #Letstalklumos campaign seeks to raise awareness about the issue and encourage action to end the harmful practice of institutionalizing children, with the hope of making the idea of such practices obsolete in the near future.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Martinez had told her mother she was working on a marijuana farm in Humboldt and had not been in contact for a week. Her disappearance was part of a larger story about the high number of missing persons in Humboldt County, which has the highest per-capita rate in California. \n\nA separate article highlights the \"Humboldt 35,\" a list of 35 people missing in the county, with Bekah Martinez being one. Despite numerous leads, she remained missing until her mother's contact with the show led to her removal from the list. \n\nThe article also discusses the high number of children listed as missing in Humboldt County, with a significant portion due to foster youth who may be at risk of chronic runaways. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) work on cases, but some are challenging due to limited information or the nature of the population, which includes those in foster care. \n\nA separate article examines the high number of missing persons in the area, comparing it to the state average and attributing it partly to the state's lenient reporting standards and the high number of children in foster care.

Employees can use the app to record their activities, receive job assignments, and submit information back to the office. The app is available on multiple devices and costs a monthly fee of roughly $1 per user.\n\n3.

Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, found that women who frequently took acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol, were 29% more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD and 37% more likely with a rarer condition called hyperkinetic syndrome. The study, published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics, suggests that pregnant women should avoid chronic or long-term use of acetaminophen, but more research is needed. The researchers caution that the findings do not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, and other factors, such as genetic predispositions, may also play a role in ADHD development. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the manufacturer of Tylenol, stated that there is no conclusive evidence linking acetaminophen use to adverse effects on child development.

House Speaker John Boehner has proposed a bill to fund the government until December 15, including conditions that would delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for one year and repeal a tax on medical devices. Senate Democrats, however, refuse to accept changes to the ACA and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any such bill. The House's decision to attach these conditions to the funding bill is driven by conservative Republicans seeking to challenge the ACA and fulfill their campaign promises.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid is urging a tough stance, encouraging the House to delay the ACA without making concessions. If the House passes a bill with ACA provisions, Senate Democrats are expected to reject it, leading to a government shutdown. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, is likely to strip the ACA provisions and allow a short-term funding bill to pass, forcing the House to either accept a clean bill or face a shutdown.\n\nThe potential consequences of a shutdown are significant, with a loss of $200 million per day in the Washington region alone, affecting services, jobs, and federal programs. The White House and Democratic leaders are determined not to budge on the ACA, while House Republicans are pushing for a complete delay of the ACA. Both sides are blaming each other for the political fallout, with some Republicans accusing Reid of wanting a shutdown to hurt the party, and Democrats arguing that the burden will fall on the Republicans if the government is unable to meet its obligations.\n\nAs negotiations continue, the possibility of a partial shutdown looms, with the potential for a longer-term shutdown if a compromise is not reached.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains.

{"pred": "Archaeological excavations in Burgas, Bulgaria, have uncovered a significant discovery: a lead vessel containing ashes believed to be from the grave of John the Apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, in a reliquary from the 6th century. The reliquary, now housed in an early Christian basilica, holds great religious significance for both Bulgarian and Eastern Orthodox Christians, who consider John the Theologian (also known as John the Apostle) a revered figure. Alongside the relic, the archaeologists found a 10th-century Bulgarian royal seal, further enriching the historical context of the site.\n\nThe lead tube containing the ashes was discovered during excavations at the ancient fortress of Burgas (formerly Poros), a port and pilgrimage site in the 6th century. The discovery has been attributed to a pilgrim who likely brought the relic back from the Holy Land, as evidenced by the belief that the site held healing properties. The lead tube, measuring only 2.2 cm in length, is considered a holy possession with connections to a yearly pilgrimage tradition where manna, a supposed healing powder, was believed to appear.\n\nThe discovery has sparked interest among archaeologists and historians, as it adds to the limited number of lead tube reliquaries from this period, which were primarily used for carrying holy water. The lead tube found in Burgas is unique due to its similarity to a group of lead tube reliquaries from the 6th century, which were mainly clay tubes from other pilgrimage centers like Ephesus, Egypt, and Bobbio, Italy.\n\nThe discovery also highlights the importance of the region during the 6th century, when early Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Land was prevalent. The lead tube reliquary, with its intricate decorations, serves as a tangible link to the beliefs and practices of the time.

The study, led by Dr. Sripal Bangalore, followed 9,509 individuals for five years, observing weight fluctuations and found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78% higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attacks, a 136% higher risk of strokes, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with lower weight variability.\n\n2. Coronary Artery Disease and Lifestyle Factors: Coronary artery disease (CAD), caused by cholesterol deposits and inflammation, is a leading cause of heart disease. While maintaining a healthy lifestyle can prevent CAD, the study emphasizes the importance of keeping weight off to reduce the risk. Yo-yo dieting, particularly in individuals with CAD, can have severe consequences, with researchers finding a 124% higher risk of death in those with significant fluctuations in weight.\n\n3.

According to a study by the University of Michigan, one in seven colorectal cancer cases now occurs in individuals under 50, challenging the traditional belief that the disease mainly affects older men. This shift has implications for screening guidelines, as younger patients are more likely to have advanced stages of the cancer and require more aggressive treatments, such as surgery, compared to their older counterparts.\n\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data analyzed by the researchers revealed that younger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to have distant-stage tumors, which are associated with higher mortality rates. However, they also have better survival rates when diagnosed, possibly due to earlier detection and more aggressive treatment. The study, published in Cancer, suggests that nearly 15% of colorectal cancer patients could be missed if screening begins at the traditional age of 50, similar to the breast cancer screening recommendation of starting at 40.\n\nYounger patients with colorectal cancer are also more likely to have regional or distant metastasis, which necessitates more aggressive treatments. Despite the higher risk, younger patients have a slightly better five-year survival rate compared to those diagnosed at an older age, especially for localized diseases.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasizes the need for improved risk assessment and screening strategies for younger patients.

These findings challenge the traditional narrative of a rapid expansion from coastal regions, suggesting a more gradual and locally driven colonization.

The film is described as a brutal and visceral representation of the time, with violence and racism depicted in a raw and unflinching manner.\n\nThe first passage highlights the context of the incident, which occurred during the larger story of the 1967 Detroit riots, where 43 people were killed, and the police department was exonerated but not without criticism. The film, starring actors like Will Poulter and Algee Smith, aims to show the appalled officers and the impact of racism on the characters, but it is criticized for not diving deeply into the characters' backgrounds.\n\nThe second passage emphasizes the film's impact, describing it as a \"well-made and evocative\" but also \"numbingly brutal\" experience, with its focus on the brutality and the lack of reprieve.

{"pred": "The news covers various topics related to the search for advanced alien civilizations, energy consumption, and the potential strategies that advanced civilizations might employ to harness energy in the face of expanding space and the limitations imposed by the universe's expansion. The first article introduces the concept of Kardashev's three types of technological advancement, where civilizations progress from harvesting local resources (Level I), to星星' energy (Level II), and eventually, entire galaxies (Level III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for survival and preventing the universe's stars from becoming inaccessible due to the expansion of the universe driven by dark energy. Hooper argues that advanced civilizations would actively capture and harvest stars to secure their energy supply as stars in neighboring galaxies become unobservable.\n\nThe second passage is a brief explanation of the WARCZone, a collection of uploaded WARCs (Wayback Machine records) that are not necessarily part of the Wayback Machine but are accessible for reference and research purposes.\n\nThe third passage delves into the idea of ancient extraterrestrial civilizations, particularly those millions of years older than humanity, needing immense amounts of energy. To achieve this, the concept of Dyson spheres, which are massive swarms of satellites, are proposed as a means to harness star energy. These structures, such as the \"Dyson spheres\" or \"statites,\" would create a gravitational field around a star, capturing its energy and potentially even using it to propel themselves. The search for alien civilizations often involves looking for unusual galaxy signatures or light emissions, as described by Hooper, who connects the expansion of the universe to the detectable traces of these structures.\n\nIn summary, the key points discussed are:\n\n1. The Kardashev classification of civilizations, with humans estimated to be at a Type I level, while advanced civilizations could be at Types II or III, harnessing star energy.\n2. The importance of capturing distant stars to avoid being left behind in the expanding universe, as proposed by Hooper's study.\n3. The concept of Dyson spheres or statites as potential structures that ancient, advanced civilizations might have created to gather and utilize star energy.\n4. The search for alien civilizations often involves identifying unique galaxy signatures or energy emissions from these structures.\n\nThese ideas from science fiction, such as the \"Dyson spheres\" mentioned in Olaf Stapledon's novel and Larry Niven's \"Ringworld,\" offer intriguing possibilities for understanding the strategies and technologies that advanced civilizations", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "The news articles cover various aspects of human evolution and stone age tool-making, with a focus on the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya. Here's a summary of the main findings:\n\n1. Climate-driven tool advancements: Researchers have discovered evidence of tool-making advances and trading networks among Homo sapiens or their relatives around 320,000 years ago in the Olorgesailie Basin. This period, known as the Middle Stone Age, saw the use of larger, specialized tools for foraging over more extensive areas due to unpredictable climate changes, leading to the need for more distant tool procurement and potentially long-distance communication.\n\n2. Olorgesailie tools: The oldest Middle Stone Age tools found in the area, such as hand axes, date back to approximately 320,000 years ago. These tools, made from obsidian sourced from distant locations, indicate the development of trading networks and the potential for inter-regional cooperation.\n\n3. Environmental impact: The region's frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions around 320,000 years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo sapiens, may have driven these behavioral changes and technological advancements. The changing landscape forced foraging populations to adapt, using smaller, more specialized tools for more efficient hunting and gathering.\n\n4. Tool downsizing: The decrease in the use of older, heavier tools and the rise of obsidian tools suggests a shift in resource management and the development of more specialized tasks, possibly indicating the emergence of a more diverse set of tools and possibly a more complex social structure.\n\n5. Evidence of cultural practices: The discovery of red pigment, possibly used for signaling or artistic expression, further supports the idea of a more complex social and cultural landscape during this time.\n\n6. Challenges in understanding: The lack of direct fossil evidence of the toolmakers at Olorgesailie complicates the timeline of tool development, with some researchers speculating that the transition to Middle Stone Age tools might have been a gradual process rather than a sudden event.\n\n7. Middle Stone Age as a precursor to modern humans: The presence of early Middle Stone Age tools and the expansion of social networks and technological innovation suggest that the roots of modern human behaviors were present earlier than previously thought, possibly in African populations before the migration out of the continent.\n\nIn summary, the Olorgesailie discoveries challenge the traditional narrative of a sudden \"human revolution\" and highlight the importance of long-term environmental changes and the development of social networks in shaping human behavior and technological advancements.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Passage 2: President Trump's homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, defended the president's tweet against CNN, arguing that it was not intended as a threat and that it was a way for Trump to respond to unfair treatment on cable news. However, this response drew criticism from CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who believed the tweet incited violence.\n\n3. Passage 3: President Trump asserts that his social media usage is \"modern day presidential,\" following accusations that his tweets are inflammatory and a cause for concern. He uses the platform to counter what he perceives as fake news and to communicate with his base, sparking discussions about the appropriateness of his tweets and their impact on his image.\n\n4. Passage 4: The article highlights that President Trump's tweets have consistently sparked controversy since his presidency, with some Republicans expressing concerns over his use of social media, particularly after tweets targeting specific individuals like Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. Some senators, like Nebraska's Sen. Ben Sasse and Alaska's Sen. Lisa Murkowski, have raised concerns about the potential negative impact of Trump's tweets on the presidential image.\n\nIn summary, these news passages discuss the president's controversial social media behavior, the administration's defense of it, and the mixed reactions it generates among politicians and the public.

On November 15, Israel's cabinet authorized the mobilization of up to 75,000 reservists, indicating a potential invasion of Gaza following the first rocket attack on Jerusalem in decades. Gaza's capital, Gaza City, and Tel Aviv were both targeted with rockets, causing no casualties but damaging infrastructure. Hamas, the ruling group in Gaza, claimed responsibility for the attacks on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Egypt's prime minister visited Gaza to denounce Israeli aggression but failed to secure a truce, as the conflict escalated with both sides launching more airstrikes and rocket strikes.\n\nIsrael's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted many of the rockets, but not all, resulting in the deaths of 30 Palestinians and three Israelis, with scores of injuries. The situation has raised concerns about a potential ground invasion by Israel, which could escalate tensions further. The United States has urged countries with ties to Hamas to pressure the group to stop rocket attacks, while Egypt's President, Mohammed Morsi, is visiting Gaza to mediate and support the Palestinians, but the Israeli military response remains uncertain. The conflict has also strained Egypt's relationship with Israel, as the new Egyptian government is more supportive of Hamas and has seen a strain on the $1 billion annual military aid from the US.\n\nIn the midst of the violence, the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, plans to visit Jerusalem, Cairo, and the West Bank, hoping to promote a de-escalation. The situation has sparked international concern, with the Nonaligned Movement criticizing Israel's actions and calling for a UN resolution.

A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times. Israel has now hit 250 Gaza targets, while taking further steps toward a ground invasion, calling up 16,000 reservists, the Wall Street Journal reports. It's also steadily sending troops and armored vehicles to the border, notes CNN—between 1,500 and 2,000 are already there, one official said. Israel claims the attacks have weakened Hamas' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but Hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple Israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with Hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new Egyptian regime would be more active in helping the Palestinians. \"The time has changed,\" he said. \"No longer the Israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the Palestinians without being held responsible.

{"pred": "In recent years, Mars has emerged as a more promising location for extraterrestrial life due to the discovery of a massive ancient ocean覆盖 a significant portion of the northern hemisphere, as reported by NASA scientists. A study published in the journal Science revealed that a substantial body of water, comparable to an Earth-sized ocean, covered the planet around 4.5 billion years ago. This ancient ocean, which was 10 times larger than the current Martian polar caps, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, and its high concentration of deuterium (D/H) suggests a global water layer up to 137 meters deep.\n\nThe presence of such a large body of water on Mars challenges the previous understanding that the planet was primarily arid and had limited water availability. The study, conducted using powerful telescopes, analyzed the Martian atmosphere's water vapor, which showed a significant enrichment in deuterium, indicating that Mars had lost a significant amount of its original water through sublimation. The high D/H ratio, up to 8 times Earth's standard (VSMOW), was observed in certain basins and high-altitude regions, suggesting that water on Mars was highly enriched in deuterium.\n\nThis enrichment, according to the researchers, implies that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer that was 4.5 billion years ago, which is much thicker than previously thought. The study's lead author, Michael Mumma, said that the findings imply Mars could have been habitable for a longer period than previously believed, potentially fostering the existence of life.\n\nWhile the exact extent of the ancient ocean is debated, the research provides a more optimistic view of Mars' potential habitability. The planet's thinning atmosphere and the subsequent loss of water through escape into space have led to a shift in the understanding of Mars' history and its potential for supporting life. The search for life on Mars is expected to intensify in 2022 with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which aims to further investigate the planet's habitability and search for signs of past microbial life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

These are low, throaty sounds that may have evolved separately in different animal lineages, including birds, due to the presence of a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch.

In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

This decision, which has been in the works since 2002, comes after years of debate and a legal battle that lasted until 2005 when the Tennessee Appeals Court ruled that Vanderbilt could change the name but only after returning the donation.\n\nVanderbilt's move aligns with a growing trend among universities in the US to reevaluate their connections to Confederate symbols and address the issue of racism and slavery. The university has also added a chief diversity officer to its leadership team and has been making efforts to promote diversity and inclusivity in recent years.\n\nIn a separate development, Vanderbilt is not alone in facing similar challenges. Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) is currently grappling with the renaming of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a controversial figure due to his association with the Ku Klux Klan, and the Tennessee Board of Regents is currently considering a proposal to remove the Confederate name from MTSU as well.\n\nVanderbilt's decision to rename the building has sparked mixed reactions. Some, like former lawyer Doug Jones, argue that it \"slams on history\" and \"rewrites\" the past, while Chancellor Zeppos emphasizes the importance of teaching history through the language used to describe buildings and symbols.

The House, under Speaker Boehner's guidance, is adopting a strategy of inaction, with little legislation being introduced and few votes taken.\n\nThe second passage delves into the perceived powerlessness of politicians to instill fear with the term \"sequester.\" The speaker argues that politicians, despite the dire predictions of severe cuts, will not suffer any salary reductions since the sequester only affects non-membership staff and not their own salaries. Instead, they may opt for furloughs for their aides. The focus remains on the pork barrel spending, with defense budgets potentially slashed but not necessarily the funds for projects that members of Congress want to see funded.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the political gamesmanship surrounding the命名 of a NASA facility and the use of the sequester as a political tool, with Congress seemingly more concerned with avoiding action than addressing the budget cuts. The article underscores the disconnect between the rhetoric of fear and the reality of the situation, as members of Congress' salaries remain intact while others face furloughs.", "answers": ["We shouldn't be too worried about the sequester—after all, Congress doesn't exactly seem to be recoiling at the thought.

{"pred": "The news articles discuss the use of Bayesian statistics in the search for missing aircraft, specifically focusing on the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the Air France Flight 447. Bayesian methods, developed by Thomas Bayes, have been applied in past searches for submerged objects and have proven effective in refining search strategies. In the case of Flight 447, Bayesian calculations helped narrow down the search area after initial efforts failed.\n\nIn the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 case, Bayesian inference helps investigators update their probability estimates based on new information, such as the likelihood of a deliberate disappearance and the plane's flight path. The search involves considering multiple dimensions, including latitude, longitude, and the probability of a crash caused by human intervention. Bayesian statisticians, like those from Metron Scientific Solutions, have been involved in past successful searches, demonstrating the value of their approach in adapting to new information and adjusting search strategies accordingly.\n\nHowever, the article also highlights the limitations of Bayesian statistics in this particular situation, as the complexity of the search and the new evidence of a possible intentional act increase the difficulty. Some experts argue that Bayesian methods may not be suitable for drastic changes in the situation, as they rely on a prior understanding that the plane might not be in the initial search area.\n\nDespite these complexities, Bayesian techniques remain valuable in providing a structured approach to subjective judgment, as demonstrated in the Air France search where Bayesian calculations led to the discovery of the wreckage. However, the use of Bayesian statistics in the Malaysia Airlines case, with its added layers of uncertainty, raises questions about the effectiveness of the method, as it adjusts to conflicting theories.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayesian statistics play a crucial role in refining search strategies for missing aircraft, but the specific application in the Malaysia Airlines case is complex and subject to ongoing refinement as new information comes to light. The search for Flight 370 remains a challenging and mysterious endeavor, with the hope that Bayesian methods will eventually lead to the discovery of the missing plane and its cause.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes.

The Virtual Telescope Project, led by astrophysicist Gianluca Masi, will host a live lunar total eclipse session starting at 11:30 UT, accessible both online and through their partnership with astrophotographers in Australia, the US, and Australia. In addition, a Supermoon rising above Rome's iconic landmarks will be broadcasted at 16:00 UT.\n\nThe total eclipse will be visible in a specific time range across different regions, with the moon's passage through the Earth's shadow creating a total phase that lasts for 77 minutes.

Microsoft claims that the system is only active when a specific command is given, like \"Xbox On,\" and that it operates in a low-power state for listening mode to conserve energy.\n\nXbox's previous Kinect, used in the Xbox 360, also faced privacy issues, but Microsoft has stated that the new Kinect for the Xbox One will have stronger privacy protections. The company has assured that the device will not be continuously listening without a specific command and that it will run in a low-power mode when not in use.\n\nIn summary, all three tech companies, Samsung, Microsoft, and Xbox, are collecting user data through their respective smart devices, but they are taking measures to protect privacy, such as allowing users to opt-out or limiting data collection when the devices are not actively using voice commands. However, the constant monitoring and potential for data breaches have raised concerns about the internet of things and the amount of data being collected by these devices.", "answers": ["Own a Samsung smart TV?

Former cheerleader Krystal C., who filed the initial suit in 2014, alleged that the cheerleaders were underpaid and not compensated for practice time.\n\nThe settlement comes after years of legal battles, with the Jets denying the claims and disputing the allegations. The NFL team maintained that the cheerleaders were independent contractors, but the court ruled that the pay and working conditions fell short of minimum wage requirements. The settlement now sets a precedent for other NFL cheerleading teams, such as the Buffalo Bills, who have faced similar wage disputes.\n\nIn related news, the California cheerleaders have won the right to be paid like regular employees, highlighting the ongoing issue of fair pay for cheerleaders across the NFL. The NFL has been criticized for treating cheerleaders as contractors rather than employees, with some teams, like the Bengals and Buccaneers, having already settled their own lawsuits for significant amounts.\n\nThis settlement marks a victory for the cheerleaders, who will receive fair compensation for their work, and it underscores the need for the NFL to review and potentially revise its policies regarding cheerleading pay and employee classification.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found them to be inconsistent with the supposed positions of a person in the crucifixion, casting doubt on the traditional narrative. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various poses and found that the blood flow on the shroud does not match the reported wounds, particularly in the hand and arm positions.\n\nThe researchers observed that the bloodstains on the shroud, if real, indicate a standing model, rather than a person hanging from a cross or lying on the ground. The blood flow on the fabric shows discrepancies in angles, with rivulets on the hand and arm not aligning with the reported positions. The analysis, known as Bloodstain Pattern Analysis, involved comparing real and synthetic blood samples to determine the flow patterns, and the results pointed to a standing model, rather than a crucified body.\n\nWhile the Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, this investigation challenges the idea that the bloodstains are consistent with a crucifixion, suggesting the cloth might be a medieval representation or a forgery. The study's findings, though not conclusive, have raised questions about the shroud's authenticity and the methods used to create the blood patterns on the fabric.\n\nIn summary, the Shroud of Turin's bloodstain patterns, as analyzed by the researchers, do not support the traditional interpretation of a crucifixion, leading to the suggestion that the cloth might be a fake or an artistic representation from the 14th century.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

She emphasizes that the majority of these children are not orphans, but are often placed in institutions due to poverty, disability, or lack of local support.\n\nThe article highlights the statistics: 8 million children are currently in institutions, with the majority in countries like Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where progress has been made in reducing the number of placements. Lumos aims to eradicate institutionalization globally by 2050 through investments in education, healthcare, and family-based care alternatives.\n\nThe author laments the systemic issue, stating that the root cause is not just a lack of awareness but also a societal tendency to ignore or silence the plight of these children.

The PCT, stretching 2,650 miles across California, Oregon, and Washington, has seen a steady increase in through-hikers since the 1950s, with 3,346 people completing the full journey so far. The 2016 season saw 4,000+ long-distance permits issued, causing concern about overcrowding, particularly in the first 55 miles where the daily quota of 50 permits was often reached.\n\nThe Pacific Crest Trail Association implemented a permit system in 2015 to manage the growing number of hikers and protect the trail and its environment. This has led to discussions about the potential for an overcrowding problem, with concerns about environmental damage, increased rescue operations, and the need for better management. The trail's popularity has also led to a shift in the demographic, with more women hikers being observed, as evidenced by the 30% increase in female thru-hikers since the book and movie.\n\nWhile the PCTA's permit system aims to distribute hikers more evenly, some long-distance hikers, like Rusty, express a longing for the quieter days before the trail became more crowded.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial soda tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding community programs, has faced widespread backlash and is seen as a burden on businesses and consumers. Formerly hailed as a cutting-edge policy, the tax has led to a significant increase in the cost of sugary beverages, with a case of Gatorade increasing from $15.99 to $26.33. Retailers, including Costco, have responded by directing customers to purchase outside the city to avoid the tax, resulting in reduced sales for Seattle. The tax has been criticized for its regressiveness, as it disproportionately affects low-income families and is opposed by groups like Bernie Sanders and libertarians. While some argue that soda taxes may have some health benefits, studies have shown that they often do not raise significant revenue and can drive people to purchase in neighboring areas, causing sales to decline for affected businesses. The tax's effectiveness in achieving its stated goals has been called into question, with some arguing that the sudden price hike has led to consumer resistance and behavioral changes. The tax's impact on local businesses, particularly in Seattle, has been negative, with some stores seeing a decrease in sales and potential job losses. A similar tax is being proposed in Spokane, Washington, but its future is uncertain due to concerns about its impact on local businesses.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

He was removed from the Attorney General's database after the Journal's report.\n\nThe article also delves into the issue of missing persons in Humboldt County, which has the highest per-capita rate of missing persons in California. The high number of cases is partly due to the state's lenient reporting requirements and the fact that some individuals may choose to go missing voluntarily or due to personal reasons like estrangement or fleeing from an abusive situation. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and the Eureka Police Department work diligently to locate missing persons, often encountering cases where the missing individuals are not actually missing but have chosen to isolate themselves.\n\nAdditionally, the article highlights the challenges in comparing the number of missing persons in Humboldt County to other areas, as some cases are due to children in foster care or chronic runaways.

Pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol, were found to have a 29% higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD and a 37% higher risk of hyperkinetic syndrome, even when taking it to treat infections like influenza. Researchers caution that the study does not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship but suggests that pregnant women should avoid chronic or long-term use of the drug. The researchers, led by Dr. Beate Ritz from the University of California Los Angeles, recommend further research to clarify the risks. While acetaminophen is generally considered safe during pregnancy, the FDA has warned about the potential harm from large doses, and alternative methods like non-pharmacological pain relief should be considered. The American Medical Association journal's commentary emphasizes the need to consider multiple factors, as ADHD is influenced by genetic and environmental factors, not solely by prenatal acetaminophen exposure. Doctors like Dr. Jeff Chapa from Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital advise pregnant women to consult with their healthcare providers before using any medication, particularly acetaminophen, during pregnancy.

Senate Democrats, however, have refused to accept changes to the ACA, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any bill with these provisions.\n\nHouse Republicans, led by Boehner, are seeking to push their conservative agenda, particularly in their opposition to the ACA, and are likely to resist any compromise that does not fully address their concerns.

Neiman Marcus defended its decision to wait for confirmation before disclosing the attack, while Target, in contrast, notified customers promptly and experienced a dip in sales following the disclosure. A joint investigation by state attorneys general, including those from Connecticut, New York, and Illinois, is ongoing to determine if the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches are connected.\n\nIn the meantime, a 17-page report by iSight, filed to the US Secret Service, shed light on the Target breach, describing the malware used and its innovative techniques to evade detection.

The first incident occurred on March 30, 2016, when a ranger from the Kenya Wildlife Service shot and killed a male lion that had attacked a man in Kajiado, Kenya. This followed the escape of another lion from a South African park, prompting discussions about relocating而非 killing lions in similar situations. The decline in lion populations, due to habitat loss and conflict with humans, has made such incidents more frequent.\n\nIn Kenya, a 13-year-old lion named Mohawk, known for his distinctive appearance and popularity among tourists, was shot and killed by rangers after being involved in a violent attack that left a man injured. Critics condemned the decision to kill the lion without attempting to tranquilize it, arguing that it could have been captured instead to prevent further harm.\n\nIn South Africa, a lion named Sylvester, who had escaped from Karoo National Park, was also under consideration for relocation or killing due to posing a potential threat to humans. The park's fences and the increasing urbanization around wildlife reserves like Nairobi National Park have contributed to the lions' ability to escape and interact with humans.\n\nThese incidents have raised questions about the balance between conservation efforts and the protection of human lives, with wildlife experts weighing the risks and resources available for capturing and relocating lions.

Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—Kenya Wildlife Service officials tell the AP about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it.

The discovery, made at the medieval fortress site of Poros (also known as Burgas), is considered a rare and holy possession by early Christians, believed to possess healing properties. Alongside the relic, a 10th-century Bulgarian royal seal was also unearthed at the site.\n\nThe lead tube containing the ashes from John the Apostle's grave, measuring only 2.2 cm in length, is adorned with religious symbols and is believed to have been brought back from a pilgrimage to the site in Ephesus, Turkey, by a traveler from Cape Foros.

Simpson's parole has sparked a nostalgic reminder of the 1994 murder trial, with many viewers tuning in to watch the proceedings, reminiscent of the \"Trial of the Century.\"\n\nSimpson's parole hearing brought attention back to the high-profile case, with discussions about issues like criminal justice, race, and the influence of the trial on society. Journalist Celia Farber comments on how the story has become intertwined with Simpson himself. Simpson's former associates, including Tom Riccio, were present during the hearing, with Riccio accusing Simpson of orchestrating the robbery and implicating him in the planning.\n\nThe case's impact on Simpson's reputation and the legal system was revisited, with some arguing that his sentence was excessive due to the perception that it was a form of punishment for his acquittal in the 1994 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.

{"pred": "Two separate news stories involving a vegan mother and her newborn have unfolded in the last few months, highlighting the intersection of parenting, health concerns, and legal issues. \n\nIn the first case, a Seminole County, Florida, mother, Sarah Markham, was arrested for allegedly refusing to take her dehydrated newborn to the hospital due to her vegan beliefs. She is accused of not providing the baby with animal-based formula, following a doctor's orders to treat the child's condition. The baby was found in critical condition by Casselberry Police, who were tipped off about the situation. Markham was charged with child neglect and is scheduled to face a judge in August for a hearing on the charges. If convicted, she could face time in prison, but the outcome will depend on the judgment of the court.\n\nThe second story involves a similar situation where a vegan mother, also from Seminole County, lost custody of her child after a doctor diagnosed him with failing to thrive. Caleb, the child, was taken from his mother by Child Protective Services (CPS) when he lost 10% of his body weight despite her attempts to provide a vegan formula. The judge ruled that there was no evidence of abuse or neglect, dismissing the CPS claim. Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham, expressed relief that the case was dropped, and the child has since regained custody, with Markham required to provide a nutritionist's report within 10 days.\n\nBoth cases highlight the complexities of vegan parenting and the potential legal consequences when parents deviate from conventional medical advice. In the first case, Sarah Markham's actions led to an arrest, while in the second, the judge decided that the mother's stance was not a basis for removing the child from her care. The outcome of the second case, with the possibility of the criminal charge being dismissed, suggests a more lenient approach to cases involving parents with alternative beliefs and their children's health.", "answers": ["A judge in Florida has allowed a vegan mom who defied a doctor's orders to regain custody of her infant son, reports WFTV.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham. The child has been with his grandparents since he was taken out of his mother's care, and now weighs about 17 pounds. \"He's still on a soy formula,\" says Bo Markham.

An analysis of data from the University of Michigan found that one in seven colorectal cancer patients are under 50, with a growing number diagnosed at a younger age. This shift has implications for treatment and screening guidelines.\n\nYounger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to have advanced stages and distant metastases, which are associated with higher risks. Despite these challenges, they are more likely to receive aggressive treatments, such as surgery, compared to older patients. The study, based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data, revealed that younger patients have better survival rates, particularly for localized disease, but more advanced disease at diagnosis.\n\nThe study by Hendren and her team, published in Cancer, calls for a reevaluation of screening guidelines, as nearly 15% of colorectal cancers occur in individuals below 50. However, they caution that altering the recommended screening age might not be straightforward due to the potential increased cost and the need to balance the benefits against the potential harm.\n\nResearchers from the University of Michigan and the National Cancer Institute emphasize the importance of recognizing colorectal cancer in younger patients, as their symptoms may be less apparent, leading to delayed detection. They suggest that doctors should be vigilant for early warning signs like anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark stool, which could indicate the need for screening.\n\nWhile some experts, like Dr. Andrew Chan from Harvard Medical School, argue that the increase in colon cancer among young adults is a real phenomenon, the evidence for changing screening guidelines is not yet conclusive. The focus remains on understanding the environmental and lifestyle factors contributing to this trend and finding the optimal age to initiate screening.\n\nIn summary, the rise in colorectal cancer among younger patients is a significant development that requires further investigation, potentially leading to changes in screening guidelines, but the decision to do so must be carefully weighed against the benefits and costs.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The findings, led by La Trobe University's Giles Hamm and Flinders University's Gavin Prideaux, push back the estimated date of human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by 14,000 years, indicating a faster expansion than previously thought.\n\nThe Warratyi site, discovered during a survey, featured 4,300 artifacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile, with the oldest evidence of human use of ochre and stone tools. The presence of burnt eggshells and bones from megafauna, like the extinct Genyornis, suggests a complex relationship between humans and these animals. The dating of these artifacts, based on techniques like optical dating of quartz grains and radiocarbon analysis, challenges the traditional narrative of a sudden and isolated arrival of humans in the region.\n\nThe discovery of the Warratyi site challenges the assumption that the arid interior was a barrier to human migration, as the site's age and the presence of human-made tools and artifacts indicate a more prolonged presence. This finding supports the theory that humans were adaptable and innovative, with the development of local technologies, even in the harsh desert environment.\n\nThe research also highlights the importance of indigenous knowledge and the role of local communities in the preservation of cultural heritage.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The tools found in the Olorgesailie Basin, Kenya, include larger, older tools for foraging in unpredictable environments and smaller, specialized Middle Stone Age tools, possibly indicating increased mobility and the use of obsidian from distant sources, suggesting trading networks. The second passage challenges the traditional view of a \"human revolution\" occurring outside of Africa, as new discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin, Kenya, suggest that the emergence of modern behaviors, technology, and possibly complex language, occurred as early as 300,000 years ago. The tools from this period show technological advancements and the use of obsidian from distant locations, pointing to the development of trading networks among early humans.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt.

A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement. Jamaica also hopes to boost its health tourism and medical marijuana industries and make it a major player in the pot product market, the Guardian notes. International exporting, however, remains a no-no.

The Lacey Act, which covers both animals and plants, was cited as the reason for the seizure, but Gibson denied any wrongdoing, claiming they believed their wood sourcing was legal.\n\nThe first incident involved the company being investigated for potential violations related to Madagascar ebony, while the second mentioned a previous raid in 2009 over a shipment of ebony from the same country. The U.S. Justice Department's complaint against Gibson suggests they may have engaged in illegal activities, but the company maintains it has been operating within legal bounds.\n\nThe article also highlights the role of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Lacey Act, emphasizing the requirement for companies to verify the legality of their wood supply chains. The Lacey Act does not require certification, but rather requires end users to demonstrate the legality of their wood sources.\n\nChris Martin, CEO of C.F.

A massive water body, comparable to a quarter of Earth's Atlantic Ocean, covered a significant portion of the northern hemisphere, potentially providing a favorable environment for life. The study, published in the journal Science, used advanced telescopes to analyze Martian atmospheric water vapor and found that the planet's deuterium (D/H) ratio, a proxy for water loss, is enriched by a factor of 7 compared to Earth's oceans, indicating a high level of water loss over time.\n\nThe atmospheric maps revealed that water near the polar regions is highly enriched in deuterium, with concentrations reaching up to 8 times Earth's standard, suggesting a global equivalent water layer that was at least 137 meters deep. This water loss suggests that Mars had a more extensive water supply in its early history, with a global ocean covering 13% of the planet's surface.\n\nNASA's Curiosity rover has already shown that Mars had standing water for billions of years, leading to the hypothesis that the planet may have been habitable for a longer period than previously thought. However, the exact amount of water and the distribution across the planet's surface remain uncertain due to the escape of ordinary hydrogen into space.\n\nAstronomers, including those from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, used a combination of telescopes to study the Martian atmosphere and concluded that the planet's water was heavily depleted in hydrogen, with a D/H ratio that indicates a significant water loss. This loss could have led to the formation of a global ocean, although the actual coverage was likely limited to the northern lowlands.\n\nWhile the discovery of the ancient ocean raises the possibility of past habitability, the exact conditions and the persistence of life remain speculative. Further research, such as the upcoming European Space Agency's Exomars rover, aims to investigate these questions and search for potential signs of life on Mars.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The review by Mick LaSalle of The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a film that relies on its star power, particularly Smith's charm, rather than substance.\n\nWill Smith plays the role of Nicky, a seasoned con artist, and Margot Robbie's character, Jess, is a young apprentice learning the trade. The review points out that the chemistry between the two actors, particularly in a scene where they interact at a football game, is the highlight of the film.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long associated with ferocious roars in popular culture, may not have sounded like the terrifying beasts we imagine, according to new research. The study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaur vocalizations, particularly those of the iconic Tyrannosaurus rex, were more akin to the coos of birds like doves or the mumbles of ostriches. These \"closed-mouth vocalizations\" involved low, throaty sounds, unlike the high-pitched calls of mammals. The sounds were likely produced through a bulging esophageal pouch, a feature found in large-bodied birds like pigeons and cassowaries.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who created the dinosaur sounds for the 1993 film Jurassic Park, revealed that some of the iconic raptor sounds were actually inspired by real-life animals. For instance, the raptor's hiss was based on a goose's angry hiss, and the T. rex's roar was a combination of a baby elephant's sound slowed down to create a more menacing effect. The study also found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are low-pitched and produced by animals like pigeons and ostriches, were not present in all dinosaurs, suggesting they evolved separately in different lineages.\n\nThe researchers caution that the majority of dinosaur vocalizations remain unknown due to the lack of preserved fossil evidence. However, the presence of closed-mouth vocalizations in large-bodied dinosaurs, like the ones found in birds, suggests that they may have had similar vocal abilities. This discovery challenges the common perception of dinosaurs as roaring, screeching creatures and opens up the possibility that they may have sounded more like the coos and hoots of their living relatives.\n\nThe study highlights the complexity of dinosaur vocalizations, which were likely influenced by factors such as body size and the presence of unique vocal organs. As the authors note, the evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds suggests that this behavior could have been an adaptation for specific purposes, like mating displays, where it could have been combined with open-mouthed vocalizations. This research underscores the diversity of dinosaur vocalizations and the need for further study to fully understand the sounds of these long-extinct creatures.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

This breakthrough, known as \"mind-reading\" in a rudimentary sense, suggests the possibility of decoding internal imagery, such as dreams and memories, without visual cues.\n\nThe experiment involved subjects lying in an MRI machine, with their brain activity linked to specific visual elements in the videos.

{"pred": "The article discusses the use of Bayesian statistics in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the challenges involved in locating the plane's wreckage. Bayesian statisticians, known for their ability to update probabilities based on new information, have been instrumental in refining the search strategy. The plane's disappearance, with increased likelihood of a deliberate act, has shifted the focus to specific areas, making the search more complex.\n\nThe search for the missing aircraft involves considering multiple dimensions, including the plane's flight path, ocean currents, and the probability of the plane's communication systems being tampered with. Bayesian methods have been successfully applied in past searches, such as the Air France Flight 447 case, where they helped locate the wreckage.\n\nHowever, the current Malaysia Airlines search presents additional complexities due to the limited number of similar失踪 cases to draw upon for guidance. Bayesian techniques, like those used by statisticians at Metron, require careful consideration of expert judgment and the potential for uncertainty, as Bayesian probabilities can be adjusted based on new information.\n\nDespite the challenges, Bayesian methods offer flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, unlike pure Bayesian reasoning, which can be less effective when faced with significant changes in the situation. The search for Flight 370, with its unique circumstances, highlights the limitations of Bayesian statistics, as Bayesian statistician Bradley Efron suggests, but also underscores the importance of considering alternative scenarios and adjusting probabilities as new evidence emerges.\n\nIn the case of the Air France search, Bayesian techniques led to the discovery of the wreckage, but the Bayesian approach used by the Metron team was refined after the initial search, demonstrating the iterative nature of the method. The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, involving Bayesian calculations, is ongoing, with the likelihood of finding the plane's remains in the Indian Ocean remaining uncertain.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayesian statistics, while providing valuable tools for refining search strategies, face challenges in adapting to the unique circumstances of the Malaysia Airlines case, highlighting the need for subjectivity and the potential for expert judgment.

In 2012, a US soldier from the 87th Supply Battalion of the 3rd Infantry Division distributed new uniforms, but the State Department was concerned about the potential impact of Marines wearing uniforms on diplomacy in the region, despite earlier warnings against it.\n\n2. The House Benghazi Select Committee released a final report that reveals a two-hour video conference call during which the attack was discussed, with discussions focusing more on the video's role in the violence rather than immediate evacuation plans. The report also highlights that the State Department was concerned about the uniforms potentially causing security issues.\n\n3. The majority report, authored by Reps. Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo, exposes the Obama administration's misleading narrative about the Benghazi attack, suggesting they intentionally provided a false account to the public while privately acknowledging a coordinated terrorist attack.\n\n4. The report's \"additional views\" by Jordan and Pompeo highlight the discrepancies between the public statements made by the administration and private communications that showed a different picture of the events, with the administration being aware that the attack was not a protest but a terrorist act.\n\n5. The report's timeline shows that the administration, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, initially claimed the attack was a response to an inflammatory video, but private communications revealed a different story, with the focus on the video being a pretext for the actual terrorist operation.\n\n6. The report's release was met with criticism from Rep. Elijah Cummings, who called the Select Committee's work \"partisan\" and accused the Republicans of hiding exculpatory evidence and preventing transparency.\n\n7. The final report from the Benghazi Select Committee, after being delayed, confirmed that the attack was a terrorist act and criticized the State Department's handling of the situation, particularly regarding the uniforms and the lack of a stand-down order.\n\n8. The report's summary states that the Benghazi attack was not a result of a stand-down order or a political attempt to shape public opinion, and that the administration's initial statements were based on incorrect information.\n\n9. The report's release did not significantly alter the understanding of the attack, and Cummings argues that the public should not be misled by the report's presentation.\n\nIn conclusion, the news highlights the internal divisions within the US government, the administration's misleading narrative about the Benghazi attack, and the Select Committee's efforts to uncover the truth.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked.

According to a recent study published in the Lancet, the United States leads the world in obesity, with 13% of the population being obese, despite having only 5% of the global population. However, this problem is not unique to the US, as obesity rates are rising globally, with no country seeing a decline in the past three decades.\n\nThe study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, reveals that obesity is a growing concern in many countries, with rates increasing in both men, women, and children. Developing countries, particularly in the Middle East, Central America, and the Pacific, are experiencing particularly high obesity rates, with some countries like Kuwait, Qatar, and Tonga seeing obesity rates exceed 50% in both men and women.\n\nThe rise in obesity is attributed to factors such as increased access to cheap, high-calorie, processed foods, sedentary lifestyles, and changes in gut bacteria. The problem is not limited to wealthy nations, as obesity rates are also on the rise in poorer countries. The global obesity rate has doubled since 1980, with 2.1 billion people affected, or 30% of the world's population.\n\nThe report's authors, Christopher Murray and Roland Sturm, emphasize that there is no country that has successfully reduced obesity rates over the past three decades. This includes both developed and developing nations, with obesity rates increasing in all regions. The World Health Organization (WHO) is currently conducting a study to address the rising obesity among children, highlighting the need for solutions to combat this growing health issue.\n\nIn summary, the world is witnessing a global obesity epidemic, affecting millions of people across different countries, with no clear solution to date.

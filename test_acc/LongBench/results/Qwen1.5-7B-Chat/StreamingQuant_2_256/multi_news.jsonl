The symptoms include muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and in severe cases, paralysis that can require ventilator support. There is no specific cure for AFM, and treatment is often focused on managing symptoms and supportive care.\n\nIn 2014, a large outbreak of AFM, possibly linked to the Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) strain, occurred, affecting mostly children.

Enteroviruses, particularly EV-D68, have been suspected but not definitively proven to cause the majority of cases.\n\nThe CDC advises maintaining good hygiene, avoiding contact with sick individuals, and staying up to date with vaccinations as preventive measures. Parents and healthcare providers should be aware of the symptoms and seek medical attention immediately for any sudden limb weakness in children.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found them to be inconsistent with the supposed positions of a person in the crucifixion, casting doubt on the traditional narrative. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various poses and found that the blood flow on the shroud does not match the reported wounds, particularly in the hand and arm positions.\n\nThe researchers observed that the bloodstains on the shroud, if real, indicate a standing model, rather than a person hanging from a cross or lying on the ground. The blood flow on the fabric is inconsistent with the supposed angles of a crucifixion, with rivulets appearing at angles that do not align with the natural flow of blood from a crucifixion wound. The analysis, which involved real and synthetic blood samples, suggests that the blood patterns are more consistent with a model being positioned to mimic the wounds rather than a live person.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for the Shroud's origin and the techniques used to create the image on the cloth. While the Vatican has not officially weighed in on the authenticity, this investigation challenges the idea that the shroud is a genuine relic from the time of Jesus.

The Malian army, already weakened, is unable to counter the rebels' advance, and the international community, including the Economic Community of West African States, has imposed sanctions on the junta to pressure them into restoring civilian rule.\n\nThe situation in Timbuktu, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is particularly alarming as the city's cultural heritage is at risk due to the arrival of Islamist rebels who have imposed their interpretation of Islamic law. The Malian government, under the leadership of President Alassane Ouattara, is working with regional partners to address the crisis, but the lack of unity among regional leaders and the ongoing conflict have limited their effectiveness.\n\nThe sanctions have caused a severe impact on Malians, with residents lining up at gas stations to fill up their vehicles before supplies run out.

BP's remuneration committee, led by Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg, has promised to review its pay policies in light of the shareholder concerns.\n\nDudley's pay increase, which included a portion in the form of pension and deferred bonus shares, was criticized by shareholder advisory groups like Glass Lewis, which raised concerns about the correlation between the executive's pay and the company's underperformance. The group recommended that shareholders vote against the pay package, and their concerns were echoed by some institutional investors.\n\nThe vote comes at a time when other major corporations, such as Shell, have also faced shareholder backlash over executive pay, with some CEOs seeing their salaries decrease despite company performance. BP's rivals, like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell, have seen their pay packages fall in comparison.\n\nThe company's board, however, defended the pay decision, stating that Dudley had met or exceeded performance targets set for him. BP's Chairman Svanberg acknowledged the shareholder dissatisfaction and pledged to engage with them to understand their concerns and potentially revise the company's pay policy for the upcoming year.\n\nThis rejection of executive pay packages highlights growing shareholder activism in the UK and globally, with investors pushing for more accountability and a connection between executive performance and compensation.

The PCTA reports a 200% increase in trail-related website traffic due to the book and movie, leading to a rise in permit requests for long-distance hikes. The trail, which stretches 2,650 miles across California, Oregon, and Washington, has traditionally seen only 3,346 completed through-hikes since its inception in the 1950s, but the recent attention has attracted more than 4,000 thru-hikers in 2016, with 3,000 of those getting permits. The PCTA's new quota system, limiting daily permits to 50, aims to prevent overcrowding and protect the trail and its environment.\n\nThe increase in hikers has led to concerns about the impact on the trail, with some fearing a potential \"lost souls\" phenomenon, where inexperienced hikers may cause disturbances and strain on resources. The PCTA, along with Cheryl Strayed, has launched a campaign called #responsiblywild to promote Leave No Trace principles, encouraging hikers to maintain the trail's natural beauty and minimize their environmental footprint.\n\nWhile the PCTA's permit system has been effective in managing the growing number of hikers, the high demand has led to a near sellout of daily permits, highlighting the need for continued management and awareness. The trail's appeal has also diversified, with more women hikers and a growing interest from those seeking a spiritual or transformative experience, as seen in the case of Strayed's hike.\n\nIn response to the overcrowding, the PCTA is considering further adjustments to the permit system, possibly expanding the number of permits or implementing a lottery system.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015.

With a small, bird-like body and a Velociraptor-like skull, it likely had a feathered tail for aerodynamic purposes, making it the oldest known creature with this adaptation.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Similar protests and economic impacts have been observed in other jurisdictions, such as Philadelphia and Cook County, where the tax was also met with customer backlash and decreased sales. The tax's effectiveness in achieving its health and revenue goals remains a topic of debate.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol, were found to have a 29% higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD and a 37% higher risk of hyperkinetic syndrome, even when taking it to reduce fever symptoms. The researchers caution that the study does not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but suggests that pregnant women should avoid chronic or long-term use of the drug until more research is conducted.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data from 64,000 Danish children and their mothers, found that acetaminophen use was not limited to treating infections, as some women reported taking it for pain relief without realizing the potential side effects.

This followed the escape of another lion from a South African park, prompting discussions about relocating the animal instead of killing it due to concerns about the species' declining population and the difficulty in tranquilizing lions in such situations.\n\nIn Kenya, the stray lion, Mohawk, a 13-year-old celebrity lion with a distinctive Mohawk mane, was killed by rangers after it attacked a motorcyclist, despite attempts to capture and relocate him. The killing sparked outrage among locals and social media users, with many questioning the decision to use lethal force without attempting a tranquilizer dart.\n\nIn South Africa, a lion named Sylvester, who had escaped from Karoo National Park, faced similar scrutiny when wildlife officials considered killing him to prevent potential threats to humans. The park's fences and the increasing urbanization around the park have contributed to the rise in lions straying from their natural habitats.\n\nBoth countries are grappling with the challenge of managing lions in the face of habitat loss, human-lion conflicts, and limited resources for capturing and relocating the animals.

Planet Nine, estimated to be around five to ten times the mass of the Earth, is inferred to be influencing the orbits of distant dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system.\n\nBrown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, argue that the gravitational influence of Planet Nine is the best explanation for the unusual clustering of these objects, unlike Pluto, which was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. The planet's existence, if confirmed, would rewrite the solar system's history and potentially restore Pluto to a more prominent position.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine has been challenging, as it is located at a distance where it would be extremely difficult to observe with current technology. Telescopes on multiple continents are currently scanning the area, and the discovery of Planet Nine would require a combination of luck and precise observation.

This shift has implications for treatment and screening guidelines.\n\nYounger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to have advanced stages and distant metastases, which are associated with higher mortality rates. However, they also tend to receive more aggressive treatments, such as surgery, compared to older patients. Despite the higher risk, younger patients have slightly better survival rates, particularly when diagnosed with localized disease.\n\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data, analyzed by the National Cancer Institute, revealed that younger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to be diagnosed with regional or distant tumors, which are more aggressive. This has led some researchers to suggest that screening guidelines may need to be reevaluated, with a potential shift towards starting screening at a younger age, similar to breast cancer, which is recommended to begin at 40.\n\nHowever, experts like Dr. David Weinberg and Dr. Andrew Chan, while acknowledging the rise in colon cancer among younger patients, are cautious about altering screening guidelines without further research. They argue that the increased risk might be due to environmental factors or a combination of factors, and more evidence is needed to determine if earlier screening would effectively prevent the disease.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising number of younger patients with colorectal cancer challenges current guidelines and prompts a discussion about the need for updated screening practices and risk assessments. While the impact on overall survival is mixed, the study underscores the importance of continued surveillance and awareness of early warning signs.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "Archaeological discoveries in South Australia have revealed a previously unknown human settlement in the Flinders Ranges dating back 49,000 years, challenging the commonly accepted timeline of human arrival in the region. The site, located near a rock shelter with evidence of fire-making and the use of ochre, contains artifacts and bone fragments from large megafauna, suggesting coexistence and possibly interaction between humans and these animals. The findings push back the earliest known human occupation in the arid interior by 5,000 years and indicate that humans migrated southward from the northern regions much earlier than previously thought.\n\nLead archaeologist Giles Hamm, working with Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard, stumbled upon the site during a survey. The site, Warratyi, has yielded around 4,300 artifacts and 200 bone fragments, with the oldest dated to 49,000 years. The discovery of ochre use and the development of bone tools challenges the assumption that these innovations were brought from other regions. The site's location in the arid interior also supports the idea that humans were able to adapt and survive in the region despite the harsh climate.\n\nThe presence of megafauna bones and eggshells, along with the use of stone tools and ochre, suggests a complex relationship between humans and the environment. This finding contradicts the belief that climate change alone was responsible for the megafauna's extinction, as humans were actively interacting with the land during this time.\n\nThe dating of the site, particularly the bone artifacts and ochre usage, is crucial in understanding the timeline of human technological advancements in Australia. The study, published in Nature, challenges the conventional narrative of human colonization in the continent and highlights the ingenuity and adaptability of the earliest Australians.\n\nThese findings contribute to the ongoing debate about the timing and methods of human migration in Australia, with some researchers suggesting a more rapid expansion than previously thought. The study also underscores the importance of considering Indigenous knowledge and perspectives in understanding prehistory.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

The first passage introduces a model proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, which suggests three stages of technological advancement (Level I, II, and III) where civilizations expand their energy resources to maximize their potential. The paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, adds a new twist to this concept, stating that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for survival as the universe expands and makes stars inaccessible. Hooper argues that advanced civilizations would actively capture and harvest stars to secure their energy resources and maintain contact with other galaxies.\n\nIn the realm of science fiction, the idea of capturing stars through massive satellite structures, such as Dyson spheres or statites, is explored.

This period saw the use of larger, more specialized tools, possibly indicating foraging over larger areas due to unpredictable landscape changes.\n\n2. The Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya, home to the oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, displays a trend of downsizing tools and the emergence of obsidian, suggesting long-distance trade and potential cooperation among hominid populations. The tools, made from distant sources, point to the existence of trading networks.\n\n3. The shift to Middle Stone Age tools, characterized by smaller, specialized tools, coincides with a period of increased environmental variability, possibly driven by climate changes. This period, around 320,000 years ago, is seen as a time of innovation and adaptation to changing landscapes.\n\n4. The discoveries challenge the traditional view of a sudden \"human revolution\" for the emergence of modern behaviors, as some of these innovations were present in the African stone age, around 300,000 years ago. This challenges the idea that modern behaviors, like symbolism and art, arose solely after Homo sapiens left Africa.\n\n5. The shift to Middle Stone Age tools, with their smaller size and specialized design, indicates a more complex and technologically advanced society, involving long-distance exchanges of raw materials like obsidian, which were not common in earlier stone age tool-making.\n\n6.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it?

On NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, Trump explained that gun control wouldn't help because \"they can be sick as hell and they’re geniuses in a certain way. They are going to be able to break the system.” He also told NBC that to avoid copycat killings, the media should have followed the local sheriff's advice and refused to name the gunman after the mass shooting in Oregon.

{"pred": "In recent news, scientists have discovered significant evidence of a large ancient ocean on Mars, suggesting that the planet was more habitable in its youth. A massive water body, comparable to a quarter of Earth's Atlantic Ocean, covered a significant portion of the northern hemisphere, potentially providing a favorable environment for life. The study, published in the journal Science, used data from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, the Keck II telescope, and the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope to analyze the Martian atmosphere and detect a high concentration of deuterium, a key indicator of water loss over time.\n\nThe atmospheric maps reveal that water near the polar regions is enriched in deuterium, with an enrichment level up to 8 times that of Earth's ocean, equivalent to a global ocean layer 137 meters deep. This indicates that Mars had a much thicker and more extensive water reservoir in its past, with estimates suggesting that the planet once possessed enough water to cover a fifth of its surface in a global ocean.\n\nThe presence of this ancient ocean challenges the previous understanding of Mars' water cycle, as flowing water was previously believed to be scarce and intermittent. The study's lead author, Michael Mumma, suggests that Mars was wet for a longer period, up to 1.5 billion years, which raises the possibility of past habitability. However, the exact amount of water and the distribution of this ocean across the planet remain uncertain due to the escape of hydrogen into space.\n\nMethane detection by NASA's Curiosity rover has also been mentioned, but it is not conclusively linked to life on Mars. The debate about the planet's habitability continues, with some researchers arguing that the high deuterium content in the remaining water suggests a warmer and wetter past, potentially conducive to life.\n\nIn summary, these discoveries point to a more hydrated and potentially habitable Mars in its early history, challenging the current understanding of the planet's climate and the possibility of past life. Further research is needed to determine the exact extent and nature of the ancient ocean and its potential impact on Mars' potential for supporting life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaur vocalizations, particularly those of the iconic Tyrannosaurus rex, were more akin to the coos of birds like doves or the mumbles of ostriches. These \"closed-mouth vocalizations\" were likely produced through a process involving a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch, which allowed for low, throaty sounds rather than the high-pitched calls of modern birds.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the iconic Jurassic Park, explained that creating the raptor and dinosaur sounds required a mix of real animal recordings and creative manipulation. For instance, the raptor's hiss was inspired by a goose's angry hiss, while the T. rex's roar was based on a baby elephant's sound slowed down to create a more menacing effect.\n\nThe study also found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are low-pitched and produced by animals like pigeons and Cassowaries, are not universal among dinosaurs. The researchers believe that these vocalizations may have been limited to large-bodied dinosaurs, possibly as a result of their size and the need for low-frequency sounds, which are more easily produced in their esophageal pouches.\n\n闭嘴发声，或称为“关闭性发声”，是鸟类通过喉囊产生的一种独特声音，与通过打开的喙发出的高音调鸣叫不同。这种发声方式在恐龙中可能并不常见，因为大型恐龙的化石记录中缺乏直接证据。然而，由于鸟类和鳄鱼都属于有闭嘴发声能力的动物，这表明这种行为在某些恐龙中也可能存在，特别是在大型恐龙中，它们可能拥有类似鸟类的低频发声能力。\n\n闭嘴发声的进化可能是为了适应大型身体和特定的社交需求，如繁殖展示。研究人员认为，这种行为在不同的恐龙种类中至少独立演化了16次，这在体型较大的鸟类中更为普遍，如鸽子和鹦鹉。尽管大部分鸟类使用的是开放性发声，但大型恐龙如果具备类似的发声机制，可能会发出类似鸽子或鹦鹉的低沉声音。\n\n总的来说，这些发现挑战了我们对恐龙声音的传统认知，将恐龙的咆哮声与现代鸟类的鸣叫相联系，揭示了一个可能与我们想象中的电影中的声音截然不同的史前世界。未来的研究将继续探索恐龙", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

This breakthrough, known as \"mind-reading\" in a rudimentary sense, suggests the possibility of decoding internal imagery, such as dreams and memories, without visual cues.\n\nThe experiment involved subjects lying still in an MRI machine, with their brain activity monitored.

Bayesian statisticians have been instrumental in refining search strategies and adjusting probabilities based on new information, such as the plane's flight path and communication system shutdown. In the case of Flight 447, Bayesian methods helped locate the wreckage after a two-year search, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.\n\nThe search for Flight MH370, which disappeared in 2014, presents a more complex challenge due to the possibility of a deliberate act and the need to account for multiple dimensions, including wind, ocean currents, and the likelihood of the plane's location based on previous searches. Bayesian techniques are applied to update the search probability distribution as new data becomes available.\n\nHowever, statisticians like Bayesian expert Tony O'Hagan argue that the situation with Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 might not be suitable for Bayesian methods, as the new evidence suggests a more remote possibility of the plane being in the initial search area. The search for the missing plane has faced difficulties, with the likelihood of finding it shifted towards areas closer to the last known position due to the increased probability of a deliberate act.\n\nIn the Air France case, Bayesian statistics combined with expert judgment led to the successful recovery of the wreckage, highlighting the importance of considering multiple scenarios and adjusting probabilities as new information arises. The search for MH370, on the other hand, remains inconclusive, with the possibility of the plane being in an underwater location where debris might not necessarily lead to the discovery of the entire aircraft.\n\nOverall, Bayesian statistics, though not a perfect match for the complexity of the Malaysia Airlines case, provide a systematic approach to integrating new information and adapting search strategies in challenging situations.

In 2012, a US soldier from the 87th Supply Battalion of the 3rd Infantry Division distributed new uniforms, but the State Department was concerned about the potential impact of Marines wearing uniforms on the region's perception of diplomacy, despite earlier warnings against it.\n\n2. The House Benghazi investigation revealed that the 2012 video conference, led by White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, focused more on the video's role in the attack than on immediate evacuation plans. The discussion also included concerns about the use of uniforms, with State Department officials suggesting they might hinder security due to potential identification.\n\n3. The final report by the House Benghazi Select Committee, along with a 51-page \"additional views\" by Reps. Jordan and Pompeo, exposes the administration's misrepresentation of the Benghazi attack. They claim the Obama administration intentionally provided a false narrative to the public, downplaying the role of terrorism and linking it to an anti-Islamic video.\n\n4. The report highlights inconsistencies between public statements made by officials and private communications, revealing that the administration was aware of the attack's coordination with al Qaeda and the involvement of an organized group, yet continued to attribute it to a spontaneous protest.\n\n5. The State Department's position on the uniforms issue was that it did not affect the military's ability to respond, with State Department spokesperson Mark Toner stating that the clothing choice did not impact the response to the attack.\n\n6. The Benghazi Select Committee's final report, despite being released, was met with criticism from Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who accused the committee of partisanship and a lack of transparency, particularly in accessing information.\n\n7. The report's summary, despite containing new details, did not alter the conclusion that the Benghazi attack was a terrorist act, contradicting the public narrative provided by the administration.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the State Department's confusion over uniform usage, the House Select Committee's investigation revealing a cover-up by the Obama administration, and the political fallout from the Benghazi affair, with questions surrounding the handling of the situation and the accuracy of the official narrative.", "answers": ["The Republican-led House Benghazi committee released its final report Tuesday after two years of investigations.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked.

Despite their divorce and a year apart, sources claim Cruise's note had a positive impact on Holmes, who is said to have been \"genuinely touched\" by his words.\n\nIn other news, the article mentions a Royal Bodyguard warning about potential danger to Kate Middleton's baby, but does not delve into further details.

{"pred": "In the first three phases of Egypt's parliamentary elections, the country's first since the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak, Islamists have made significant gains, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party leading the way. The Brotherhood is expected to consolidate its position, possibly securing a majority, despite doubts from some analysts. The election comes amid ongoing political tensions, with protesters demanding an end to military rule and a transition to civilian governance. The trial of Mubarak, now in his hospitalized condition, has resumed, with prosecutors charging him with tyranny and corruption. The court has heard arguments that Mubarak's rule was marked by oppression and violence, particularly during the uprising that led to his downfall. The outcome of the elections remains uncertain, with the military council's formula for allocating seats among parties yet to be announced. The new parliament, due to be formed, will likely face challenges in defining its powers and forming a new government. Economic growth has slowed due to the unrest, with foreign currency reserves declining and the stock market suffering. The Brotherhood, while maintaining a commitment to forming a coalition, aims to minimize the influence of more conservative Islamists and maintain a degree of liberal representation in the parliament.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house.

Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes.

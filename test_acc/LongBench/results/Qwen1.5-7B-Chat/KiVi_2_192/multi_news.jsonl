{"pred": "Two recent studies, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, reveal the harmful effects of cigarette smoke on antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Researchers from the University of California, San Diego, and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System found that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA to antibiotics, making it more difficult to treat and causing it to become more aggressive.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, shows that cigarette smoke extract hampers the immune system's ability to fight off MRSA, as it stresses the bacteria and makes them less susceptible to the immune cells' defenses. Specifically, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke becomes more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are crucial for combating bacterial infections. The research also indicates that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA is more likely to adhere to human cells, enhancing its survival and infectivity.\n\nThe study findings suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also contributes to the increased resistance of MRSA, making it more resilient to antibiotics. The bacteria's cell walls become more resistant to the immune system's defenses, allowing it to evade traditional treatments and potentially leading to higher infection rates in hospital settings and other healthcare environments where smoking is prevalent.\n\nCrotty Alexander, the lead researcher, warns that cigarette smoke's effects on MRSA could be a contributing factor to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infections. The study also highlights the need for further research on the interaction between smoking and other pathogens, as well as the development of new strategies to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nIn a related study, e-cigarette vapor was found to have a similar effect on MRSA, making it more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and cell wall stress. However, the researchers noted that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA exhibited a stronger resistance, with a 10-fold increase in resistance compared to e-cigarette vapor.\n\nOverall, these studies emphasize the negative impact of cigarette smoke on MRSA and suggest that understanding these interactions could contribute to the development of new strategies to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria and reduce the risk of infections in smokers.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The disease, known as acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), affects the spinal cord and can be caused by various viruses, including enteroviruses and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. In 2014, a link was suggested between a strain of enterovirus, likely EV-D68, and a surge in AFM cases, but the CDC has not detected the virus in recent years in cases of AFM.\n\nThe symptoms of AFM include muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and facial drooping. There is currently no specific cure for the disease, and treatment is often focused on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. Rehabilitation and therapy are often necessary for patients who have lost function. Parents and healthcare providers are advised to practice good hygiene, such as hand washing, to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nEnterovirus D68, though not directly linked to the current AFM outbreak, was present in the US in 2014, and its recurrence or a new strain could potentially contribute to the rise in cases. The CDC is urging doctors to report any suspected cases of AFM and is conducting research to identify the cause and potential treatments.\n\nChildren affected by AFM, particularly those in 2014, often experienced a respiratory illness before the paralysis set in. Some cases required ventilation support, and while some children have partially recovered, the long-term effects can be severe, leaving some with limited mobility. Parents and healthcare professionals are concerned about the lack of understanding about the disease, with one parent stating, \"There needs to be more information about it.\"\n\nThe rise in AFM cases has raised concerns among health officials, who are monitoring the situation closely and urging doctors to report any cases.

Researchers, Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used forensic techniques to analyze the bloodstains on the cloth, known as Bloodstain Pattern Analysis. Their findings indicate that the blood patterns are inconsistent with a person lying flat, as seen in the Shroud, suggesting the image could not have been made by a body in that position.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found that the blood on the cloth, which contains iron oxide possibly from pigment or blood, does not match the position of wounds consistent with the crucifixion wounds of Jesus as described in religious tradition. The researchers tested various positions, such as a standing mannequin with a standing position and a hand with a \"blood belt\" on the waist, and found that the blood flow angles do not match the ones on the shroud.\n\nThe bloodstains on the hands and the lance wound in the torso, particularly the rivulet formation, are incompatible with the supposed position of the body during crucifixion. The blood flow on the wood surface, which should have been influenced by gravity, was inconclusive, further supporting the idea that the shroud's image might be a medieval representation rather than a direct depiction of the crucifixion.\n\nThe investigation, which used both real and synthetic blood samples, challenges the commonly held belief that the shroud's blood patterns are consistent with the crucifixion story. The lack of a consistent blood flow pattern and the inconsistency in the angles of the bloodstains point to a possible standing model being used to create the image, casting doubt on the shroud's authenticity.\n\nWhile the study does not definitively prove the shroud's forgery, it raises questions about its authenticity and the methods used to create the image.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

In 1996, the internet archive's crawl data, donated by Alexa Internet, were added to the Wayback Machine after a embargo period. The founder of Lumos, inspired by a photograph of a child in an institution, began writing letters to influential individuals, leading to the establishment of the charity and its mission to shed light on the plight of millions of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination.\n\nLumos' CEO, Georgette Mulheir, shares the harrowing reality of these institutions, describing them as \"nightmarish\" with inadequate living conditions and severe consequences for children's development. The issue of child institutionalization affects 8 million children worldwide, with the majority being in institutions due to lack of adequate care, healthcare, and family support. Lumos aims to eradicate this practice by 2050 through investments in inclusive education, healthcare, and fostering alternatives. The organization has seen significant progress in countries like Moldova, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70%, and the Czech Republic, where there has been a 75% decline in admissions.\n\nThe global community is encouraged to support these efforts, as ending institutionalization not only improves the lives of affected children but also presents a more cost-effective and socially beneficial solution. Lumos, with its partnerships and advocacy, is setting a precedent for donors and governments to prioritize family-based care and work towards a world where the practice of institutionalization becomes a thing of the past.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The vote, which was non-binding, came amid a backdrop of falling oil prices and a $5.2 billion loss for the company. BP's Chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, defended the pay raise, stating that it was based on the company's strong performance during a challenging year, but he promised to review the compensation policy in light of the shareholders' concerns.\n\nThe shareholder backlash against BP's pay packages extends beyond BP, with other companies, such as Smith & Nephew and Royal London Asset Management, also facing shareholder protests over executive pay. In the case of BP, this is the first time since 2011 that a top British company has faced such a significant rejection of a pay package. The company's remuneration policies and the performance of other major oil companies, like Shell, have been criticized for not aligning with their underperforming financial results.\n\nGlass Lewis, a shareholder advisory group, raised concerns about the correlation between executive pay and performance, arguing that the bonuses awarded to BP's executives, including Dudley, were not commensurate with the company's poor financial performance. The issue has led to calls for stricter corporate governance and a reconsideration of executive pay practices across the industry.\n\nThe growing trend of shareholder activism over executive pay highlights the changing landscape of corporate governance, with investors pushing for greater transparency and accountability in the wake of the financial crisis and the drop in oil prices.

The dinosaur's fossilized feathers, with traces of melanosomes, suggest that it had a vibrant, possibly iridescent, appearance.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

Martinez had told her mother she was working on a marijuana farm in Humboldt and had not been in contact for a week. Her disappearance was part of a larger story about the high number of missing persons in Humboldt County, which has the highest per-capita rate in California. \n\nA separate article highlights the \"Humboldt 35,\" a list of 35 people missing in the county, with Bekah Martinez being one of them. Despite her discovery on \"The Bachelor,\" the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office continues to investigate her case, as she was last seen in November 2017 and her mother's report was not confirmed until December. The high number of missing persons in the area, despite the high standard for reporting, is attributed to factors like the county's transient population, foster care, and the lack of a waiting period for missing persons reports.\n\nThe article also discusses the challenges in comparing Humboldt County's missing persons rate to the state average due to California's lenient reporting requirements. Some cases, like Martinez's, involve individuals who have chosen to go off the grid or are in the process of reconnecting with estranged family members.\n\nAdditionally, the article covers a broader issue of missing persons in the region, with a focus on the \"Humboldt 35\" and the high number of children reported missing, often due to the county's high number of foster youth, who are at a higher risk of becoming missing. The article also mentions the case of Cody Conoboy, a missing juvenile whose case remained on the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) despite a positive match to a DNA sample.\n\nIn conclusion, the news highlights the complex nature of missing persons cases in Humboldt County, involving factors like the local cannabis industry, transient populations, and the challenges in tracking down missing individuals.

Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, found that women who frequently took acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol, were 29% more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD and 37% more likely with a rarer condition called hyperkinetic syndrome. The study, published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics, suggests that pregnant women should avoid chronic or long-term use of acetaminophen, but more research is needed. The researchers caution that the findings do not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, and other factors, such as genetic predispositions, may also play a role in ADHD development. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the manufacturer of Tylenol, stated that there is no conclusive evidence linking acetaminophen use to adverse effects on child development, and they encourage pregnant women to consult with their doctors.

House Speaker John Boehner has proposed a bill to fund the government until December 15, including conditions that would delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for one year and repeal a tax on medical devices. Senate Democrats, however, refuse to accept changes to the ACA and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any such bill. The House's decision to attach these conditions to the funding bill is driven by conservative Republicans seeking to challenge the ACA and fulfill their campaign promises.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid is urging a tough stance, encouraging the House to delay the ACA without making concessions. If the House passes a bill with ACA provisions, Senate Democrats are expected to reject it, leading to a government shutdown. The Senate, controlled by Democrats, is likely to strip the ACA provisions and allow a short-term funding bill to pass, forcing the House to either accept a clean funding bill or face a shutdown.\n\nThe potential consequences of a shutdown are significant, affecting around 200,000 federal workers in the Washington region, with an estimated daily loss of $200 million and the closure of popular attractions like the National Zoo and Smithsonian museums. The economic impact extends beyond the region, with local governments and businesses depending on federal funding.\n\nThe political calculus is complex, with both parties and the White House vowing not to budge on the ACA. The shutdown could become a test of public opinion, with Republicans potentially suffering more politically, and the White House and Democrats hoping to capitalize on the public backlash against the House's actions.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown.

{"pred": "A significant shift in colorectal cancer incidence is being highlighted by a growing body of research, particularly involving younger patients. According to a study by the University of Michigan, one in seven colorectal cancer cases now occurs in individuals under 50, challenging the traditional belief that the disease mainly affects older men. This shift has implications for screening guidelines, as younger patients are more likely to have advanced stages of the cancer and require more aggressive treatments, such as surgery, compared to their older counterparts.\n\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data analyzed by the researchers revealed that younger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to have distant-stage tumors, which are associated with higher mortality rates. However, they also have better survival rates when diagnosed, possibly due to earlier detection and more aggressive treatment. The study, published in Cancer, suggests that nearly 15% of colorectal cancer patients could be missed if screening begins at the traditional age of 50.\n\nYounger patients with colorectal cancer are also receiving more aggressive treatments, with 72% of those with distant metastasis undergoing surgery compared to 63% for older patients. Despite the higher risk, younger patients have a slightly better five-year survival rate, especially for localized tumors.\n\nThe study's authors argue for a review of screening guidelines, considering the need for earlier detection and risk assessment for younger individuals. However, there is debate about whether changing the screening age would significantly reduce colon cancer incidence, as some experts, like Dr. David Weinberg, believe the benefits might not outweigh the costs.\n\nIn the meantime, doctors are encouraged to be vigilant for early warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as dark blood in stool, and to consider starting screening earlier for those with a family history or other high-risk factors.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

In a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a team led by Giles Hamm, a La Trobe University consultant archaeologist, found evidence of a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, the oldest known in the arid interior of the country. Hamm's colleague, Clifford Coulthard, stumbled upon the site during a routine exploration, discovering it while looking for a toilet break. The site, with its evidence of fire-making and the use of ochre, challenges the commonly held belief that humans entered Australia from the north after a 50,000-year-old timeline. The artifacts and bone fragments found at Warratyi, including evidence of bone tools and ochre use, push back the development of key technologies in Australia by several thousand years. The site also reveals interactions with megafauna, with evidence of coexistence and possibly even hunting, as indicated by the presence of bones from the extinct Diprotodon and other megafauna. These findings challenge the notion that climate change was the sole driver of megafauna extinction, suggesting a more interactive relationship between humans and the environment.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The film, starring actors like Will Poulter and Algee Smith, aims to show the appalled officers and the impact of racism on the characters, but it is criticized for not diving deeply into the characters' backgrounds.\n\nThe second passage emphasizes the film's approach, which combines real events with fictional elements, including a police officer, played by Will Poulter, who is portrayed as a menacing figure.

The first article introduces the concept of Kardashev's three types of technological advancement, where civilizations progress from harvesting local resources (Level I), to星星' energy (Level II), and eventually, entire galaxies (Level III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for survival and preventing the universe's stars from becoming inaccessible due to the expansion of the universe driven by dark energy. Hooper argues that advanced civilizations would actively capture and harvest stars to secure their energy supply as stars in neighboring galaxies become unobservable.\n\nThe second passage is a brief explanation of the WARCZone, a collection of uploaded WARCs (Wayback Machine records) that are not necessarily part of the Wayback Machine but are maintained for reference by the team. Hooper's paper in the WARCZone explores the possibility of alien civilizations using Dyson spheres or similar structures to collect energy from stars, particularly Type III civilizations that might have already started this process. These structures, such as Dyson spheres or statites, would require enormous amounts of energy and could be detected through their unique radiation signatures.\n\nIn summary, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is linked to the need for advanced civilizations to adapt to the expanding universe and the challenge of harvesting distant stars. Hooper's model proposes that the pursuit of energy resources is a key factor in intergalactic exploration, and the presence of such structures could be identified through their distinctive energy signatures.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "The news articles cover various aspects of human evolution and stone age tool-making, with a focus on the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya. Here's a summary of the main findings:\n\n1. Climate-driven tool advancements: Researchers have discovered evidence of tool-making advances and trading networks among Homo sapiens or their relatives around 320,000 years ago in the Olorgesailie Basin. This period, known as the Middle Stone Age, saw the use of larger, specialized tools for foraging over more extensive areas due to unpredictable climate changes, leading to the need for more distant tool procurement and potentially long-distance communication.\n\n2. Olorgesailie tools: The oldest Middle Stone Age tools found in the area, such as hand axes, date back to approximately 320,000 years ago. These tools, made from obsidian sourced from distant locations, indicate the development of trading networks and the potential for inter-regional cooperation.\n\n3. Climate-driven tool changes: The shift from the earlier stone tools to the more specialized ones suggests a response to environmental changes, with frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions. This period coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens, indicating the importance of adaptability and resourcefulness in a rapidly changing landscape.\n\n4. Evidence of trading: The discovery of obsidian tools, which are not commonly available locally, indicates the existence of trading networks. This could have facilitated the exchange of resources and potentially contributed to the development of complex social behaviors.\n\n5. Technological advancements: The new tools from the Middle Stone Age, characterized by smaller and more specialized stone tools, suggest a higher level of planning and division of labor. The presence of obsidian from distant sources hints at the exchange of raw materials, possibly indicating the establishment of social networks.\n\n6. Middle Stone Age as a precursor to modern humans: The findings challenge the traditional view of a sudden \"human revolution\" occurring after the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, suggesting that some of these behaviors and innovations were present much earlier in the region.\n\n7. Regional context: The Olorgesailie discoveries challenge the idea that modern human behaviors emerged solely outside Africa, pointing to a more complex and diverse picture of human evolution in the continent.\n\nIn summary, the Olorgesailie findings suggest that our ancestors were highly adaptable and innovative, with complex social networks and trade networks already in place 320,000 years ago, long before the traditionally recognized \"human revolution.\" This evidence supports the idea that modern human behaviors and traits may", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

{"pred": "The news can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. In 2011, the Justice Department raided the Gibson Guitar Corporation in Tennessee, alleging the company's use of illegally sourced wood, a violation of the Lacey Act. This marked the second such raid, following a previous one in 2009 over an ebony shipment from Madagascar. The company, however, maintains it did not violate any laws and disputes the claims based on evidence provided.\n\n2. The Lacey Act, which addresses the trade of endangered species, including plants, was amended in 2008 to include the import of illegally harvested wood. The Environmental Investigation Agency's director, Andrea Johnson, clarified that the act does not require independent certification, but rather requires end users to verify the legality of their supply chains.\n\n3. Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, expressed frustration over the raids, stating that the company has not been charged and has lost millions in business due to the lack of transparency in the investigation. The U.S. Justice Department has not disclosed the specific violations it believes Gibson committed.\n\n4. The Lacey Act's enforcement has led to concerns among musicians and industry professionals, particularly those using illegally sourced materials like Madagascar rosewood. Some, like Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., believe the law is necessary to combat illegal logging, while others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, argue that it creates uncertainty for those who may have purchased wood before the ban.\n\n5. The Internet Archive, which has received data donations from Alexa since 1996, has a feature called the Wayback Machine, which archives web pages to preserve internet content. This highlights the intersection of music and environmental regulation, as the吉他 manufacturer's situation raises questions about the legality of using wood sourced from endangered forests.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the legal battle between Gibson Guitar and the U.S. Justice Department over the alleged use of illegally sourced wood, as well as the broader issue of environmental regulation and the impact on the music industry. The case highlights the complexities of enforcing the Lacey Act and the challenges faced by musicians and businesses in verifying the legality of their wood supplies.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

Gaza's capital, Gaza City, and Tel Aviv were both targeted with rockets, causing no casualties but damaging infrastructure. Hamas, the ruling group in Gaza, claimed responsibility for the attacks on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Egypt's prime minister visited Gaza to denounce Israeli aggression but failed to secure a truce, as the conflict escalated with both sides launching more airstrikes and rocket strikes.\n\nIsrael's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted many of the rockets, but not all, resulting in the deaths of 30 Palestinians and three Israelis, with scores of injuries. The situation has raised concerns about a potential ground invasion by Israel, which could escalate tensions further. The United States has urged both sides to de-escalate the situation, with the US Secretary of State, Mark Toner, calling on Hamas to stop rocket attacks. Egypt, under the new leadership of President Mohamed Morsi, is involved in diplomatic efforts, sending a message that it will not tolerate aggression but also seeking a peaceful resolution.\n\nThe situation has strained Egypt's relationship with Israel, as the country's $1 billion aid to Israel under the previous government has been paused. The international community, including the United Nations, has condemned the violence, with the Nonaligned Movement demanding the UN to take action against Israel.

A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times.

It's also steadily sending troops and armored vehicles to the border, notes CNN—between 1,500 and 2,000 are already there, one official said. Israel claims the attacks have weakened Hamas' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but Hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple Israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with Hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new Egyptian regime would be more active in helping the Palestinians. \"The time has changed,\" he said. \"No longer the Israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the Palestinians without being held responsible.

{"pred": "In recent years, Mars has emerged as a more promising location for extraterrestrial life due to the discovery of a massive ancient ocean覆盖 a significant portion of the northern hemisphere, as reported by NASA scientists. A study published in the journal Science revealed that a substantial body of water, comparable to an Earth-sized ocean, covered the planet around 4.5 billion years ago. This ancient ocean, which was 10 times larger than the current Martian polar caps, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, and its high concentration of deuterium (D/H) suggests a global water layer up to 137 meters deep.\n\nThe presence of such a large body of water on Mars challenges the previous understanding that the planet was primarily arid and had limited water availability. The study, conducted using powerful telescopes, analyzed the Martian atmosphere's water vapor, which showed a significant enrichment in deuterium, indicating that Mars had lost a significant amount of ordinary hydrogen due to its leakage into space.\n\nThe high deuterium content in the remaining water, particularly in basins and mountainous regions, suggests a global water enrichment of up to 8 times Earth's standard (VSMOW), which would require a global layer of water ice at least 137 meters thick. This discovery raises the possibility of past habitability on Mars, with the presence of liquid water potentially supporting the existence of life.\n\nHowever, the exact amount of water and its distribution on the planet remain uncertain, with some researchers suggesting that the water may have pooled deeper in the planet's low-lying plains, forming a global ocean. The search for life on Mars is expected to intensify in 2022 with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which aims to find chemical signs of life and further investigate the planet's habitability.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "The European Court of Justice has ruled that Nestlé's attempt to trademark the shape of the KitKat chocolate bar, known as the \"four-finger wafer shape,\" has been rejected. This comes after a long legal battle between Nestlé and rival chocolate manufacturer Mondelez, with Nestlé arguing that the unique shape was distinctive enough to be protected as a trademark. However, the court found that Nestlé failed to prove its shape is recognizable across all EU countries, and the EU's Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must reconsider its decision. The ruling has implications for other brands operating in the EU, as it highlights the need for a product's distinctiveness to be proven across all markets within the bloc. The case is not yet closed, as both Nestlé and Mondelez can still present new evidence to the EU trademark office. The legal battle over KitKat's shape, often seen as a symbol of the UK's relationship with the EU, has also been mentioned in the context of Brexit, with some arguing that the EU's handling of the case could affect the future of the product in the UK.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long associated with ferocious roars in popular culture, may have actually made bird-like sounds, according to new research. A study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaurs, particularly large-bodied species, may have produced sounds similar to those of today's birds, such as coos or mumbles, rather than the loud, high-pitched screams often imagined. The iconic \"Jurassic Park\" T. rex roar, created in a sound studio, was not based on actual dinosaur vocalizations. Instead, it combined elements from various animals like baby elephant cries, tiger chuffs, and a gurgling alligator. Some dinosaurs, like the cooing of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich, could have been their natural sounds if they possessed a bird-like syrinx, which is a two-pronged organ in the chest.\n\nThe lack of fossil evidence for dinosaur vocalizations makes it difficult to pinpoint specific sounds, but scientists believe closed-mouth vocalizations, which are low, throaty sounds, may have evolved separately in different animal lineages due to the presence of a bird-like organ called an esophageal pouch. This organ allows large-bodied dinosaurs, like today's birds, to produce these sounds without the need for a vocal cord. The study's lead author, Chad Eliason, suggests that if dinosaurs had a similar vocal system, they might have made sounds like those of doves or ostriches.\n\nWhile the iconic T. rex roar from \"Jurassic Park\" is a product of sound design, the study challenges the common perception of dinosaurs' sounds, suggesting they might have been more akin to those of their living relatives, rather than the roar heard in the film. This understanding of dinosaur vocalizations could provide insights into their behavior and communication patterns, which remain largely unknown due to the limited fossil evidence.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

They have developed a technique that allows them to reconstruct YouTube videos from the brain activity of participants, creating a continuous, albeit blurry, representation of the original content. This breakthrough, known as \"mind reading\" or \"internal imagery reconstruction,\" suggests the possibility of someday viewing a person's thoughts and dreams without visual cues.\n\nThe study involved subjects lying still in an MRI machine, with their brain activity linked to specific visual elements in the videos. By analyzing the patterns of brain activity, the researchers were able to predict and, to some extent, reconstruct the content of the videos. This represents a significant leap forward from previous attempts to reconstruct static images, as it now handles dynamic visual experiences.\n\nThe technology has potential applications beyond mere entertainment, as it could potentially reveal internal imagery, such as dreams and memories. However, the researchers caution that the current level of understanding is limited, as it relies on brain activity during visual processing, and more complex regions of the brain, like those related to interpretation and memory, remain unexplored.\n\nWhile the researchers envision the technology's potential for broadcasting imagery to paralyzed individuals, using it to decode memories or even in criminal investigations raises ethical concerns.

{"pred": "The news articles discuss the use of Bayesian statistics in the search for missing aircraft, specifically focusing on the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the Air France Flight 447. Bayesian methods, developed by Thomas Bayes, have been applied in past searches for submerged objects and have proven effective in refining search strategies. In the case of Flight 447, Bayesian calculations helped narrow down the search area after initial efforts failed.\n\nIn the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 case, Bayesian inference helps investigators update their probability estimates based on new information, such as the likelihood of a deliberate disappearance and the plane's flight path. The search involves considering multiple dimensions, including latitude, longitude, and the probability of a crash caused by human intervention. Bayesian statisticians, like those from Metron Scientific Solutions, have been involved in past successful searches, demonstrating the value of their approach in adapting to new information and adjusting search strategies accordingly.\n\nHowever, the article also highlights the limitations of Bayesian methods, particularly in situations where new evidence significantly changes the situation, as in the case of the Malaysia Airlines flight, where Bayesian statistician Brad Efron argues that the method may not be suitable due to the sudden change in the situation. Bayesian techniques require careful consideration of subjective judgments, which can be challenging in complex situations like the missing plane mystery.\n\nDespite the challenges, Bayesian methods provide a structured framework for integrating new information, allowing search teams to refine their search areas and adapt to changing circumstances. The use of Bayesian statistics in the Malaysia Airlines search, though, is not without controversy, with some critics arguing that it may not be the best approach given the complexity of the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayesian statistics, particularly in the form of Bayesian inference, plays a crucial role in refining search strategies for missing aircraft, but its effectiveness depends on the availability of accurate data and the ability to adapt to new information. The ongoing search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 remains a challenging and complex case, with the search team using Bayesian techniques to update their probability distributions as new information comes to light.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

His career in the 1990s saw him shift from prestigious projects to embracing roles in animated films, such as \"Aladdin,\" where his voice acting brought immense joy and imagination to children. He often went to great lengths to please his audience, taking on challenging roles in films like \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and \"Hook,\" where he disguised himself to fully embody the characters and their innocence. Despite his success in serious projects, Williams struggled with the changing landscape of adult-oriented cinema, as his interest in those roles diminished. His final performance, in \"The Fisher King,\" showcased his range as an actor, even if it was after his heyday in comedy.

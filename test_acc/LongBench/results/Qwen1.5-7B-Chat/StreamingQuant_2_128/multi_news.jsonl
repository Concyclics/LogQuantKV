Researchers from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, including Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, have found that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resilience of MRSA, making it more difficult to combat and causing it to become more aggressive.\n\nCigarette smoke, according to the research, stresses MRSA by altering its cell walls, making it less susceptible to the immune system's defenses. Specifically, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract is more resistant to reactive oxygen species, antimicrobial peptides, and has a stronger ability to adhere to human cells. This results in a slower death rate for the bacteria and increased resistance to common immune responses.\n\nThe study shows that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also aids in the survival and aggression of MRSA. Cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was found to be four times more resistant to macrophage killing and twice as resistant to antimicrobial peptides. The bacteria's resistance persisted even 24 hours after exposure, and when tested in mice, the smoke-exposed MRSA was more lethal and better at infecting human cells.\n\nThis research suggests that cigarette smoke may contribute to the increased prevalence of MRSA infections, as it primes the bacteria to evade the immune system. The findings echo a previous study on e-cigarette vapor, which also showed that e-cigarette smoke can alter MRSA's cell walls, making it more resistant.

The Kinect constantly listens and records data, even when the console is turned off, leading to comparisons to the telescreens in 1984. Microsoft claims that the device is only active when a specific command is given, like \"Xbox On,\" and that it runs in an energy-efficient low-power mode in listening mode.\n\nSimilarly, Microsoft's Xbox One's always-on Kinect raises privacy worries, as it can potentially be used to monitor users without explicit command. While the system is not actively recording all the time, the constant listening and lack of explicit opt-out option has been criticized.\n\nBoth companies, Microsoft and Samsung, have stated that they take privacy seriously and have implemented measures to protect user data. However, the constant monitoring and lack of transparency in some cases have sparked debates about the potential for data misuse.\n\nIn summary, these developments highlight the growing concern with internet-connected devices collecting and potentially listening to users' personal information, even when not actively in use, raising questions about the balance between convenience and privacy.", "answers": ["Own a Samsung smart TV?

The settlement, which covers the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons, awards each cheerleader $2,500 per season and an additional $400 for photo shoots. Former cheerleader Krystal C., who filed the initial suit in 2014, alleged that the cheerleaders were underpaid and not compensated for practice time. The settlement, which includes interest, addresses these claims and provides a benchmark for fair pay in the NFL cheerleading industry.\n\nState Senator Diane Savino, who has advocated for cheerleader pay equity, praised the settlement and called for similar action from the Buffalo Bills, another NFL team that has faced similar wage disputes. Other NFL teams, such as the Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Oakland Raiders, have also faced lawsuits over pay for their cheerleaders, with some reaching settlements or agreeing to pay millions of dollars.\n\nThe settlement in the Jet-Jets case, led by attorney Patricia Pierce, highlights the ongoing battle for better pay and working conditions for NFL cheerleaders. The cheerleaders' argument that their pay was below minimum wage, considering the time spent on appearance requirements and transportation, was successful in securing a significant payout.

Researchers from the Journal of Forensic Sciences have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and found them to be inconsistent with the supposed positions of a person in the crucifixion, casting doubt on the traditional narrative. The study, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used live subjects and mannequins to simulate various positions and found that the blood flow on the shroud does not match the reported wounds of Jesus, particularly in the \"blood belt\" at the waist and the back of the hand.\n\nThe bloodstains, which are said to contain iron oxide, either from pigment or real blood, do not support the idea that the image was transferred by a person lying flat on the fabric. The researchers found that the blood flow on the shroud is inconsistent, with rivulets on the hand and arm not aligning with the reported angles, suggesting a standing model was used to create the blood patterns.\n\nThe investigation, known as Bloodstain Pattern Analysis, used both real and synthetic blood to test the flow patterns, and the results indicate that the Shroud's depiction of blood flow does not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion, leading the researchers to conclude that the bloodstains are more consistent with a standing model, rather than a crucifixion as described in the Bible.\n\nWhile the Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, this investigation challenges the idea that the bloodstains are authentic and suggests the possibility of a medieval forgery.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The Tuareg rebels, backed by a growing number of Islamists, have taken control of the northern regions, demanding independence for Azawad. This has led to the formation of a regional diplomatic emergency committee, including Ivory Coast's Alassane Ouattara, to apply sanctions and pressure on the junta, which controls the capital, Bamako. The Malian military, already weakened, is unable to effectively counter the rebels, and the international community is being urged to provide support.\n\nThe situation in Timbuktu, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is particularly alarming as the city's cultural heritage is at risk due to the imposition of Islamic law by the rebels. The African Union has condemned the coup and imposed sanctions, causing panic among Malians who rely heavily on fuel imports for daily life. The country's economy is expected to suffer as a result of the embargo, with many businesses, including gas stations, facing shortages.\n\nThe Malian government, under the junta, has not yet shown any commitment to restoring democracy, and negotiations with the rebel group, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, are yet to materialize. The situation has escalated into a humanitarian crisis, with over 200,000 people displaced and 13 million in need of aid due to a drought and the conflict.\n\nIn summary, the coup in Mali has created a regional security threat, with the potential for instability to spread and threaten the stability of West Africa.

This data, after a embargo period, contributes to the documentation of these institutions through the Wayback Machine.\n\nThe story then pivots to a heart-wrenching image that motivated the founder to start Lumos, a charity aimed at ending child institutionalization. She attributes the existence of such facilities to a widespread lack of awareness and the belief that it's better to place children in institutions due to poverty, disability, or local infrastructure challenges. The founder's personal actions led to significant progress, with Lumos estimating that eradicating child institutionalization could be achieved globally by 2050.\n\nThe article highlights the harrowing conditions in these institutions, with children often living in cramped, unsanitary conditions and facing numerous negative consequences, both physically and mentally. It emphasizes that the majority of these children have parents who can care for them, but lack of resources and support leads to their placement.\n\nThe author recounts the establishment of Lumos and its mission to raise awareness about the issue, using the example of a photograph that sparked her to action. The charity's work includes advocating for policy changes and providing evidence of the detrimental effects of institutionalization on children's development.\n\nThe article also discusses the global scope of the problem, with 8 million children separated from their families, and the need for international donors to play a role in addressing this issue. The success stories from countries like Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has significantly decreased, serve as examples of the feasibility of ending this practice.\n\nFinally, the founder's commitment to leading Lumos for life and the launch of the #Letstalklumos campaign highlight the urgency and potential for change.

The presence of a crest and asymmetrical feathers on its tail indicate possible aerodynamic adaptations.\n\nThe discovery challenges the traditional understanding of dinosaur feather evolution, as it represents the earliest known creature with such complex feathering. Researchers are intrigued by the potential functions of the iridescent feathers, such as attracting mates or serving as a display, but more study is needed to fully understand Caihong's behavior and the role of its feathers in its life.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation.

{"pred": "Seattle's controversial soda tax, aimed at reducing sugar consumption and funding community programs, has faced widespread backlash and is seen as a burden on businesses and consumers. Formerly hailed as a cutting-edge policy, the tax has led to a significant increase in the cost of sugary beverages, with a case of Gatorade increasing from $15.99 to $26.33. Retailers, including Costco, have responded by directing customers to purchase outside the city to avoid the tax, resulting in reduced sales for Seattle. The tax has been criticized for its regressiveness, hitting low-income families harder, and for its lack of effectiveness in promoting health or generating significant revenue. The tax has also sparked public protests and led to a decrease in sales for businesses, with some chains like Costco seeing a boost in sales in neighboring areas where the tax is not imposed. The tax's impact on local businesses, particularly small retailers, has been negative, with some owners reporting significant drops in sales. The tax's effectiveness and popularity have been called into question, with some arguing that it is a regressive tax and a burden on consumers. A similar tax in Philadelphia was repealed after experiencing a similar public backlash.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Researchers from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) found that women who frequently took acetaminophen, also known as Tylenol, had a 29% higher risk of having a child diagnosed with ADHD and a 37% higher risk of hyperkinetic syndrome. The researchers caution that the study does not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, but suggests that pregnant women should avoid chronic or long-term use of acetaminophen until more research is conducted.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data from 64,000 Danish children and their mothers, found that even when taken to reduce fever symptoms, acetaminophen use was associated with ADHD in children.

Senate Democrats, however, have refused to accept changes to the ACA, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any bill with these provisions. \n\nHouse Republicans, led by Boehner, are seeking to push their conservative agenda, particularly in their opposition to the ACA, and are likely to resist any compromise that does not fully address their concerns.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The Neiman Marcus breach, which began as early as July 2013, went undetected until mid-December when the company discovered suspicious activity linked to credit card usage. Neiman Marcus then notified affected customers about the potential compromise of their payment card information but did not disclose the extent of the data stolen, such as Social Security numbers or birth dates, until after a journalist's inquiry. The company stated that the attack had been contained by January 1, 2014.\n\nTarget, on the other hand, suffered a massive data breach in late November 2013, affecting over 100 million customers due to malware placed in point-of-sale (POS) systems. The report from a computer firm, iSight, filed to the US Secret Service, revealed that the attack was carried out using a type of malware that allowed the hackers to extract credit and debit card data without encryption. The report did not attribute blame but mentioned that the operation was sophisticated and innovative, with the malware being \"new to eCrime\" and designed to evade detection.\n\nBoth Neiman Marcus and Target were targeted by a sophisticated international hacking group, with the report suggesting that the breach was part of a larger, coordinated effort. While Neiman Marcus confirmed the data breach in mid-December, Target disclosed the incident much earlier, in response to inquiries from the journalist Brian Krebs and to address the potential impact during the holiday season. The report from iSight did not identify the attackers but indicated that the operation was well-planned and executed, with the malware's capabilities allowing for large-scale data theft with low risk.\n\nGrowing concerns have emerged about the companies' handling of the situation, with some questioning Neiman Marcus for not disclosing the breach earlier. The joint investigation by state attorneys general, including those from Connecticut, New York, and Illinois, is examining the possibility of a connection between the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches, as well as the source of the malware used in both cases.\n\nIn summary, both Neiman Marcus and Target experienced significant data breaches in 2013, with Neiman Marcus' breach lasting until it was discovered, and Target's being disclosed promptly.

The first incident occurred on March 30, 2016, when a ranger from the Kenya Wildlife Service shot and killed a male lion that had attacked a man in Kajiado, Kenya. This decision was made due to the lion's aggressive behavior and the potential danger it posed to the crowd. In South Africa, a lion named Sylvester, who had escaped from Karoo National Park, was also being considered for relocation or killing, as it had caused concern for human safety.\n\nThe case of the lion in Kenya, known as Mohawk, gained significant attention after being shot and killed by rangers. Mohawk had been cornered and attacked a motorcyclist, leading to a heated debate about the use of tranquilizers and the decision to kill the lion to prevent further harm. Kenyan wildlife officials claimed that the lack of tranquilizers and the urgency to protect the man's life necessitated the lethal intervention.\n\nBoth lions, Mohawk and the one in South Africa, were part of a larger issue of declining lion populations due to habitat loss, hunting, and conflicts with humans, particularly in areas where urbanization is encroaching on their natural habitats. Conservationists and wildlife experts are grappling with the challenge of balancing the need for human safety with the preservation of these endangered species.\n\nIn response to the incidents, Kenyan wildlife officials emphasized the importance of maintaining the integrity of the park's fences and the difficulty in managing lions in densely populated areas. The South African parks service, faced with the same issue, is considering various options for the escaped lion, including relocation or killing if it poses a significant threat.\n\nThese events highlight the complex dynamics between conservation efforts and the challenges faced by wildlife in the face of human encroachment, as well as the need for better management strategies to minimize conflicts and protect both lions and human lives.", "answers": ["An escaped lion, a taunting crowd, and an ill-prepared first-response team came together in Kenya to cause what some are saying was the unnecessary, senseless death of the lion, the country's Star reports.

CAD can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and potentially life-threatening events if not managed properly. The passage also highlights the significance of a healthy lifestyle in preventing and managing CAD.\n\nPassage 3 focuses on a recent study that found yo-yo dieting, or weight cycling, could have even more severe consequences for individuals with pre-existing CAD. The study, led by Dr. Bangalore, found that those with the largest weight fluctuations had a 124% higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and deaths compared to those with minimal changes. The research underscores the need for further investigation into the potential role of gut microbes in triggering yo-yo dieting.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the negative effects of yo-yo dieting on heart health, particularly for individuals with CAD. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining weight stability and suggests that a healthy lifestyle is crucial in preventing and managing CAD. However, the studies are observational and do not establish causality, leaving room for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another. And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

She is accused of not following the doctor's orders and not providing the baby with necessary medical attention, citing concerns about animal by-products. The baby was eventually rescued by police and taken to the hospital, where she was found to be in need of immediate care. Markham faces charges of child neglect and was arrested. Her fate, including potential time in prison, will be determined by a judge at the end of August.\n\nIn the second story, a similar situation occurred in Orlando, Florida, where a mother, also named Sarah (but not the same as the previous case), had her newborn taken away by Child Protective Services due to concerns about the child's rapid weight loss. The doctor recommended hospitalization, but Sarah refused, opting for a vegan formula instead. After a court hearing, a judge ruled that she would regain custody, but with the condition of providing a nutritionist's report. This case highlights the difference in how the courts perceived the situation, as the judge saw no evidence of abuse or neglect but rather a disagreement between the mother and a medical professional.\n\nBoth cases illustrate the complexities of vegan parenting and the challenges that can arise when parents' dietary choices conflict with medical advice. In the first case, the mother's refusal to comply with medical recommendations led to an arrest, while in the second, she regained custody with the understanding to seek professional guidance.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products.

An analysis of data from the University of Michigan found that one in seven colorectal cancer patients are under 50, with a growing number diagnosed at a younger age. This shift has implications for screening guidelines, as younger patients tend to have more aggressive forms of the disease but also benefit from more aggressive treatments, leading to better survival rates.\n\nYounger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to have distant-stage tumors, which are more aggressive and have higher mortality rates. However, they are also more likely to receive surgery and radiation therapy compared to older patients. Despite the higher risk, younger patients have a slightly better five-year survival rate, particularly for localized disease.\n\nThe study by the University of Michigan's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program revealed that nearly 15% of colorectal cancer patients are below 50, with a higher likelihood of advanced disease at diagnosis. This finding prompts a call for improved risk assessment and screening strategies for younger individuals.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, emphasize the importance of recognizing early warning signs like blood in stool, which can be indicative of colorectal cancer but may be overlooked. They suggest that individuals with a family history of the disease or those at higher risk should start screening earlier.\n\nWhile some experts, like Harvard Medical School's Andrew Chan, argue that the increase in colon cancer among young adults is a cause for concern, he believes more research is needed before altering screening guidelines. The Cancer journal article calls for a reevaluation of when to start screening for colorectal cancer, acknowledging the potential benefits and challenges of earlier detection.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients necessitates a closer examination of current screening guidelines and risk assessment, with the ultimate goal of balancing prevention and treatment options.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

In a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a site dating back 49,000 years has been found, revealing one of the most important prehistoric sites in Australian prehistory. The discovery was made by Giles Hamm, a La Trobe University consultant archaeologist, and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard during a survey. The site, Warratyi, contains evidence of human activity, including the use of fire, stone tools, and ochre, as well as the presence of megafauna bones, suggesting coexistence and possibly interaction between humans and these giant animals.\n\nThe site's significance lies in its age, estimated to be around 49,000 years, which pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the arid interior of the continent. The discovery challenges the previously accepted timeline of 50,000 years for the arrival of humans in the region. The presence of burnt eggshells, which were dated to 45,000-49,000 years ago, indicates the use of fire and the development of early technologies like bone tools and ochre use. The site also revealed the earliest known evidence of human interaction with megafauna, with bones from the extinct Diprotodon optatum and eggshells from a giant bird, suggesting a complex relationship between humans and these animals.\n\nThe findings challenge the notion that climate barriers prevented early humans from moving south, as the site's location in the Flinders Ranges indicates that people were able to adapt and settle in the region even during periods of aridity. The study also highlights the ingenuity of Indigenous Australians, as the development of advanced technologies occurred locally without the need for a direct connection to the coastal settlements.\n\nThese discoveries challenge the traditional view that human settlement in the interior of Australia was delayed compared to the coastal regions. The research, published in Nature, underscores the importance of the Warratyi site in understanding the early interactions between humans and the environment in Australia. The study also underscores the need for continued research and analysis to refine the dating and interpretations of these ancient artifacts.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The first passage introduces a model proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, which suggests three stages of technological advancement (Level I, II, and III) where civilizations expand their energy usage to maximize their resources and potentially colonize the universe. The paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, takes this concept further by suggesting that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for survival as stars beyond our Local Group become inaccessible due to the expanding universe. Hooper argues that advanced civilizations would actively seek to capture and harvest stars before they are too far away to access.\n\nThe second passage is a brief overview of the WARCZone collection, which contains outsider-uploaded WARCs (Wayback Machine records) that may or may not be included in the official Wayback Machine. These records serve as a reference for the team and are accessible to the public for research purposes.\n\nThe third passage introduces the idea of ancient extraterrestrial civilizations, particularly those described in Olaf Stapledon's novel \"Star Maker,\" which proposes that advanced civilizations could create massive, energy-harvesting structures, such as Dyson spheres or statites, to harness the energy of their stars. These structures would likely be recognizable by their waste heat, which would give off a unique infrared signature.\n\nIn summary, the articles explore the concept of advanced civilizations, their energy needs, and the potential detection methods. Hooper's model suggests that advanced civilizations would actively seek to capture and utilize distant stars to stay ahead of the expanding universe, while the search for alien life involves looking for unusual galaxy signatures and energy patterns. The WARCZone and Dyson sphere concepts from science fiction literature also contribute to the discussion of potential alien technologies and their implications for understanding advanced civilizations.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

A study published in Science reveals that shifts in climate may have driven the development of tool-making advancements and trading networks among early Homo sapiens or their relatives in the Middle Stone Age, around 320,000 years ago. This includes the use of long-distance traded obsidian, suggesting the existence of trading networks among early humans in the region.\n\n2. The Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya, home to the oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, displays a trend of tool size reduction and specialized tools in response to changing environmental conditions. These tools, including obsidian-made ones, indicate potential for long-distance communication and cooperation among early humans.\n\n3. The tools found in Olorgesailie, with their specialized design and distant origin, suggest the development of a more sophisticated tool-making culture and trading networks, possibly hinting at the emergence of Homo sapiens or a closely related species.\n\n4. The shift from the earlier Acheulean culture to the Middle Stone Age around 320,000 years ago, as evidenced by the new tools, coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens, suggesting a connection between environmental changes and technological advancements.\n\n5. The discovery of red pigment and its potential use for signaling or artistic expression, as well as the use of obsidian from distant sources, indicates a level of cultural complexity and social interaction among early humans.\n\n6. The existence of a \"human revolution\" or a significant change in behavior and tool-making may not have solely occurred after the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, as previously believed. Instead, the evidence suggests that these behaviors were present earlier, around 300,000 years ago.\n\n7. The new studies challenge the notion that modern human behaviors, such as symbolism and art, emerged only after leaving Africa, pointing to a more complex and earlier history of these developments in the continent.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the complex interplay between climate, tool-making, and social interactions among early humans in the African landscape, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of the \"human revolution\" and the development of modern behaviors.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

This move, aimed at reducing the impact of marijuana possession on the island's residents, particularly young people, and promoting a regulated medical cannabis industry, has been facilitated by the creation of a cannabis licensing authority. The law also allows Rastafarians to use marijuana for religious purposes, and tourists with a prescription for medical marijuana from abroad can obtain permits to legally purchase small amounts.\n\nHowever, the government emphasizes that it will not tolerate transnational drug trafficking or the cultivation of illegal plots. National Security Minister Peter Bunting stated that the legislation does not signal a relaxation of the country's stance on drug trafficking, and the security forces will continue to enforce international treaty obligations.\n\nThe move comes after decades of debate and failed attempts to decriminalize marijuana due to concerns about violating international treaties.

{"pred": "In recent news, researchers have discovered significant evidence of a large ancient ocean on Mars, suggesting that the planet was more habitable in its youth. A massive water body, comparable to a quarter of Earth's Atlantic Ocean, covered a significant portion of the northern hemisphere, potentially providing a favorable environment for life. The study, published in the journal Science, used advanced telescopes to analyze Martian atmospheric water vapor and found that the planet's deuterium (D/H) ratio, a proxy for water loss, is enriched by a factor of 7 compared to Earth's oceans, indicating a high level of water loss over time.\n\nA team of scientists from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the European Southern Observatory have uncovered evidence of a global ocean on Mars 4.5 billion years ago, after observing the depletion of normal hydrogen and the enrichment of deuterium in the remaining water. This ancient ocean covered a fifth of the planet's surface and held an estimated 20 million cubic kilometers of water, which, if evenly distributed, would have created a global ocean up to 137 meters deep.\n\nThe study's lead author, Geronimo Villanueva, suggests that the water was likely concentrated in the northern low-lying plains due to the planet's terrain. The presence of such a large body of water on early Mars challenges the previous belief that Mars was primarily a dry and cold planet, with intermittent water flows. The high deuterium content in the polar regions indicates that Mars had a significant amount of water stored in its ice, possibly up to 8 times more enriched in deuterium than Earth's oceans.\n\nMethane on Mars, detected by the Curiosity rover, has also been linked to past water presence, although it does not necessarily mean the presence of life. The combination of these findings has led some researchers to argue that Mars could have been habitable for a longer period than previously thought, fostering the possibility of past microbial life.\n\nHowever, the exact amount of water and the persistence of liquid water on Mars are still under debate, with some scientists suggesting that the planet's initial water content may have been much larger than currently observed. The search for life on Mars is expected to intensify with upcoming missions, such as the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which aims to investigate the planet's potential habitability.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Instead, it relies on Smith's charm and Robbie's transformation, as well as some amusing scenes, to entertain audiences.\n\nWill Smith plays the role of Nicky, a seasoned con artist, while Margot Robbie's character, Jess, is a young apprentice learning the trade. The film's plot, which involves a high-stakes con involving a football game and a wealthy businessman, is criticized for its absurdity and lack of depth.

The study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaur vocalizations, particularly those of the iconic Tyrannosaurus rex, were more akin to the coos of birds like doves or pigeons. The sounds were likely \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" which involve low, throaty sounds produced by a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch. These sounds, unlike the high-pitched calls of birds with open beaks, were not commonly heard in dinosaurs, as they evolved separately in different animal lineages, possibly due to the size and anatomy of their bodies.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the iconic Jurassic Park, created many of the dinosaur sounds using a mix of real and manipulated animal noises. For instance, the raptor roars were based on the hissing of a goose, the Velociraptors' communication was inspired by mating tortoises, and the T. rex's roar was a combination of a baby elephant's sound slowed down. The study's authors note that the majority of dinosaur vocalizations were likely \"closed-mouth\" sounds, similar to those of birds, rather than the loud, high-pitched calls often associated with dinosaurs in popular culture.\n\n闭嘴发声，即通过封闭的口腔和喉部产生低音，是鸟类独有的声音特征。这种发声方式在大型鸟类中更为常见，因为它们的身体结构允许它们发出低沉的咕噜声，而非像多数小型鸟类那样发出尖锐的鸣叫。恐龙，特别是体型较大的种类，如霸王龙，可能也有类似的声音，但没有直接的化石证据来证实这一点。\n\nThe study's findings challenge the common perception of dinosaur sounds in films like Jurassic Park, where the iconic T. rex roar was created using a blend of animal noises, including a baby elephant. This suggests that the sounds we associate with dinosaurs may be a product of our cultural imagination rather than reflecting the actual vocalizations of these prehistoric creatures.\n\nIn the context of evolutionary history, the evolution of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and dinosaurs suggests that these behaviors may have evolved independently in different lineages, possibly as a result of their large body size, which allowed for unique vocal characteristics.

{"pred": "The article discusses the use of Bayesian statistics in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the challenges involved in locating the plane's wreckage. Bayesian statisticians, known for their ability to update probabilities based on new information, have been instrumental in refining the search strategy. The plane's disappearance, with increased likelihood of a deliberate act, has shifted the focus to specific areas, making the search more complex.\n\nThe Bayesian approach involves analyzing data such as flight paths, ocean currents, and previous search efforts to calculate the probability of finding the plane at any given location. The method is compared to traditional methods, highlighting the importance of considering expert judgment and the potential for subjective biases. The search for Air France Flight 447 in 2009, where Bayesian techniques led to the discovery of the wreckage, serves as a successful example.\n\nHowever, the current search for Flight MH370 faces additional complexities due to the uncertainty surrounding the cause of the disappearance and the need to account for new information, such as the possibility of a deliberate act. Bayesian statisticians, like those from Metron, use Bayesian methods to adapt to changing circumstances and update their search models as new data becomes available.\n\nNot all experts agree that Bayesian statistics is the best approach for the Malaysia Airlines case, as it may not be suitable when the situation changes drastically, as suggested by statistician Bradley Efron. Nevertheless, Bayesian techniques provide a systematic way to integrate and update probabilities, allowing for flexibility in adjusting to new information.\n\nThe search for Flight MH370 is complex due to the large area to cover and the need to account for previous searches, which can be challenging without detailed records. Bayesian methods, despite their limitations, offer a structured approach to dealing with uncertainty and contradictory information, making them valuable in the context of the missing plane search.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayesian statistics plays a role in refining search strategies for missing aircraft, but its effectiveness depends on the nature of the case and the availability of accurate data.

The House Benghazi Select Committee released a final report, revealing that the 2012 attack was initially discussed in private, with the focus on the video that the administration later used to blame for the violence. The report finds that the administration was aware the attack was not a spontaneous protest but intentionally misled the public.\n\n3. The majority report by Reps. Jordan and Pompeo includes a timeline that contradicts the public narrative presented by the administration, showing that they were aware the attack was a terrorist act but still attributed it to a protest and an inflammatory video.\n\n4. The report reveals that the State Department, undersecretary Patrick Kennedy, raised concerns about the use of uniforms, suggesting they might hinder security, but the military was never dispatched due to the lack of a direct threat.\n\n5. The State Department's official response stated that the clothing issue did not affect the response time, but the report by the Benghazi Select Committee suggests that the administration's handling of the situation was marked by partisanship and a desire to avoid blame.\n\n6.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has reported a suspected hacking attempt on its voter database, prompting a call for increased vigilance from security expert Bob Lord, who highlighted the vulnerability of various systems, including those used for voter registration and political influence operations. These incidents, along with Russia's continued influence on social media and efforts to manipulate think tanks, emphasize the changing nature of cyber warfare in politics.\n\nThe DNC discovered the alleged hacking attempt on Tuesday, which it believes was a \"simulated phishing test\" carried out through a fake login page designed to resemble a legitimate access point for the party's voter database. The incident was detected by a cloud service provider and a security research firm, and the DNC, along with these partners, managed to thwart the attack.\n\nThe widespread concern about foreign interference and domestic manipulation has led to heightened security measures by political groups and government organizations, such as Microsoft, which recently disclosed that Russian intelligence attempted to target the Senate and US conservative think tanks using fake website creations. Facebook has also reported identifying a campaign to disrupt the midterms, with the company uncovering additional disinformation efforts worldwide.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the growing threat of cyber attacks on election infrastructure, the evolving tactics employed by hackers, and the collaborative efforts between governments and private entities to protect against such attempts.

According to a recent study published in the Lancet, the United States leads the world in obesity, with 13% of the population being obese, despite having only 5% of the global population. However, this problem is not unique to the US, as obesity rates are rising globally, with no country seeing a decline in the past three decades. The study, which analyzed data from 188 countries, reveals that obesity is a growing concern in many nations, particularly in the Middle East, Central America, and the Pacific Islands.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) reports that obesity is a major health issue, contributing to various diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis. The number of overweight and obese individuals worldwide has increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013, representing 30% of the global population. This includes a significant rise in obesity rates among men and women in countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Kuwait, as well as in children and adolescents.\n\nThe rise in obesity is attributed to factors like the availability of cheap, high-calorie, processed foods, sedentary lifestyles, and changes in gut bacteria. The problem is not limited to wealthy nations, as obesity rates are also on the rise in developing countries. Notably, the obesity epidemic has not shown any signs of slowing down, with no countries managing to decrease their obesity rates over the past three decades.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that the problem is universal, affecting both rich and poor countries, and there is currently no single successful strategy to combat it. The study's authors, from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, call for urgent action, as obesity is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality.

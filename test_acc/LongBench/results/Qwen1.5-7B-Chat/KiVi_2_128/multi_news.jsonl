Researchers, Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, used forensic techniques to analyze the bloodstains on the cloth, known as Bloodstain Pattern Analysis. Their findings indicate that the blood patterns are inconsistent with a person lying flat, as seen in the Shroud, suggesting the image could not have been made by a body in that position.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, disputes the traditional theory that the blood on the cloth is from the three-day crucifixion, as the bloodstains do not match the expected flow patterns. The researchers found that the blood on the hands, for instance, exhibits angles that differ significantly from those on the back, suggesting a standing or upright position for the model that produced the bloodstains.\n\nThe analysis involved comparing real and synthetic blood to determine the flow angles, and the results showed that the rivulet patterns on the fabric do not align with the reported positions of the wounds, particularly on the hand and the back. The blood flow on the hand and the \"lumbar region\" (a term used to describe the lower back) is also inconsistent, which rules out the idea of a single, static pose for the wounds.\n\nOne notable inconsistency is the blood flow around the simulated spear wound, which matches a standing position, but not the one on the shroud. This suggests that the wound might have been inflicted while the model was standing, possibly with the arm held out at an angle that does not align with the image on the shroud.\n\nThe study's findings, if confirmed, could call into question the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, as the blood flow patterns are not consistent with the crucifixion wounds as described in the New Testament. The investigation, however, does not rule out the possibility that the shroud is a medieval representation, rather than a physical artifact from the time of Jesus.\n\nWhile the investigation is not conclusive, it highlights the need for further scientific analysis to authenticate the shroud and shed light on the techniques used to create the image.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The founder of Lumos, inspired by a photograph of a child in an institution, began writing letters to influential individuals, leading to the establishment of the charity and its mission to shed light on the plight of millions of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, or lack of local support.\n\nThe founder, J.K. Rowling, shares the harrowing story of a child in an institution that motivated her to create Lumos and advocate for change. She emphasizes that the majority of these children are not orphans but are placed in institutions due to inadequate care at home or societal attitudes. The issue of child institutionalization affects 8 million children worldwide, with the majority living in conditions that are detrimental to their health and development.\n\nLumos aims to eradicate institutionalization globally by 2050 through investments in education, healthcare, and fostering alternatives. The organization has seen significant progress in countries like Moldova, where there has been a 70% decrease in the number of children in institutions, and the Czech Republic, where the number of children in institutions has dropped significantly. These successes highlight the financial and social benefits of investing in family-based care instead of institutions.\n\nLumos, with the support of international donors, is setting a precedent for positive change.

This feathered dinosaur, with a size similar to a crow, had rainbow-colored feathers that shimmered like those of hummingbirds. The feathers on its head, neck, and chest had a unique structure, with barbs forming a pattern that could produce a rainbow effect. Caihong is the oldest known creature to have asymmetrical feathers, which are believed to have been used for aerodynamic purposes in flight. The dinosaur's fossilized feathers, with traces of melanosomes, suggest that it had a vibrant, possibly iridescent, tail and head feathers that could have been used for communication or sexual display. The study's lead author, evolutionary biologist Chad Eliason, commented on the significance of the discovery, suggesting that the dinosaur's feathers may have been more complex than previously imagined. The fossil's unique features, along with its placement on the evolutionary tree, indicate a distinct branch of paravians with a unique tail feathering pattern. The researchers also noted the presence of nanostructures in the feathers, which are similar to those of modern birds, supporting the idea that these structures are melanosomes, responsible for the iridescent colors. The dinosaur's feathers, despite being 161 million years old, provide insights into the diversity of feathering patterns in early paravians and challenge the traditional understanding of dinosaur feather evolution.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax, which charges 1.75 cents per ounce, has led to a 64% increase in the cost of sugary drinks like Gatorade, with retailers like Costco directing customers to purchase outside the city to avoid the tax. The tax has been called regressive, affecting low-income families and causing a decline in sales for affected businesses, including a 34% decrease at Costco. While some argue that the tax may encourage people to buy less soda, the public backlash and the loss of revenue have been substantial. The tax's effectiveness in improving health or unifying the city around a health goal has been questioned, with opponents pointing to the lack of impact on consumption and the negative impact on small businesses. The tax has also faced opposition from groups like the Chicagoans who have seen sales decline and customers shopping elsewhere. A similar tax in Philadelphia saw a similar drop in sales when it was implemented. The tax's impact on health and revenue collection remains a topic of debate, with some arguing for a more targeted approach to addressing health issues.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Senate Democrats, however, refuse to accept changes to the ACA and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto any such bill.

Simpson appeared before a Nevada parole board and was granted parole for his 2007 armed robbery and kidnapping conviction. Simpson, now 70, expressed remorse and apologized for his involvement, saying he wishes he hadn't gone along with the robbery. The parole decision sparked a media frenzy, reminiscent of the 1994 murder trial, where he was acquitted of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.\n\n2. Parole Hearing Coverage: Simpson's parole hearing received widespread coverage, reigniting discussions about the high-profile case and its lasting impact on society. Simpson's associates, including Tom Riccio, were mentioned for their roles in the robbery, with Riccio claiming Simpson orchestrated the crime.\n\n3. O.J. Simpson's Sentence and Influence: Simpson, who served nine years, said he's been a model prisoner and expressed regret for his actions. The parole board's unanimous decision to grant him parole raised questions about the relevance of his remorse in light of the 1994 murder case.\n\n4. Revisiting the Case: The Simpson case continues to resonate, with the recent documentaries and TV series like \"O.J. : Made in America\" and the FX drama \"The People v. O.J. Simpson\" revisiting themes of race, celebrity, and criminal justice.\n\n5. O.J. Simpson's Legacy: Despite his acquittal, Simpson's civil judgment for the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman remains, and his legal troubles, including a 2008 \"road rage\" case, highlight the ongoing legal battle over his innocence.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the enduring fascination with Simpson's story, the impact of his parole decision, and the ongoing debate over his role in the crimes, as well as the broader societal issues touched upon during the 1994 trial.", "answers": ["OJ Simpson's big moment has arrived.

{"pred": "A significant shift in colorectal cancer incidence is being highlighted by a growing body of research, particularly involving younger patients. According to a study by the University of Michigan, one in seven colorectal cancer cases now occurs in individuals under 50, challenging the traditional belief that the disease mainly affects older men. This shift has implications for screening guidelines, as younger patients are more likely to have advanced stages of the cancer and require more aggressive treatments, such as surgery, compared to their older counterparts.\n\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data analyzed by the researchers revealed that younger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to have distant-stage tumors, which are generally more aggressive, but they also have better survival rates, particularly when diagnosed with localized disease. However, the study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, suggests that this could prompt a review of screening guidelines, as nearly 15% of patients might be diagnosed later in the disease process if the current recommendation of starting screening at 50 remains.\n\nYounger patients with colorectal cancer are also more likely to receive surgery and radiation therapy, reflecting a shift in treatment strategies. Despite the higher risk of advanced disease, these patients have a slightly better five-year survival rate compared to older patients with similar conditions.\n\nThe study, published in Cancer, emphasizes the need for improved risk assessment and increased awareness of early symptoms, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark blood in stool. However, the study's limitations, including the lack of data on family history and potential selection bias, raise questions about the appropriateness of changing screening guidelines.\n\nWhile some experts, like Dr. Andrew Chan, argue that the increased incidence of colon cancer in younger patients is a real concern, more research is needed to determine if earlier screening would be beneficial. In the meantime, doctors are encouraged to be vigilant for early warning signs and to consider starting screening earlier for those at higher risk.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients is a wake-up call for the medical community, prompting discussions on potential changes to screening guidelines and the development of tailored treatment plans for this younger population.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "Archaeological discoveries in Australia have shed new light on the timeline and sophistication of human settlement in the region. In a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a team led by Giles Hamm, a La Trobe University consultant archaeologist, found evidence of a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, the oldest known in the arid interior of the country. Hamm's colleague, Clifford Coulthard, stumbled upon the site during a routine exploration, discovering it while looking for a toilet break. The site, with its evidence of fire-making and the use of ochre, challenges the commonly held belief that humans entered Australia from the coastal regions and developed their technologies later. The site contains evidence of early human interaction with megafauna, with bones from the giant Diprotodon optatum and burnt eggshells, suggesting a complex relationship between humans and these prehistoric animals. The site's artifacts, including stone tools and ochre, date back to around 49,000-46,000 years, pushing back the development of key technologies in the region. The findings challenge the traditional narrative of a sudden and rapid expansion from the coastal areas and suggest a more gradual and locally evolved human presence in the arid landscape.\n\nThe Warratyi site challenges the notion that humans were unable to adapt to the harsh conditions, as suggested by the discovery of well-preserved tools and evidence of occupation despite the site's remote location. The presence of these artifacts and the interaction with megafauna suggests a more complex relationship with the environment, possibly involving hunting and resource management.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of local innovation, as the bone tools and ochre use were found to be locally developed, rather than imported from other regions. This finding contradicts the assumption that Indigenous Australians lacked sophisticated technological advancements.\n\nThe discovery at Warratyi underscores the diversity of human cultures and the adaptability of early humans in Australia, challenging the idea that the continent's interior was uninhabitable for long periods. The study, published in Nature, contributes to our understanding of the complex prehistory of the continent and the role of indigenous Australians in shaping its cultural and environmental history.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "The news covers various topics related to the search for advanced alien civilizations, energy consumption, and the potential strategies that advanced civilizations might employ to harness energy in the face of expanding space and the limitations imposed by the universe's expansion. The first article introduces the concept of Kardashev's three types of technological advancement, where civilizations progress from harvesting local resources (Level I), to星星' energy (Level II), and eventually, entire galaxies (Level III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for survival and preventing the universe's stars from becoming inaccessible due to the expansion of the universe. Hooper argues that civilizations would expand to capture stars before they become unobtainable, possibly using Dyson spheres or other advanced structures like statites to harness their energy.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres, which are massive swarms of satellites designed to collect and recycle starlight, has been proposed by both science fiction author Olaf Stapledon and physicist Freeman Dyson. Hooper's paper posits that advanced civilizations would understand the importance of securing star resources before they become inaccessible due to the expansion of the universe.\n\nIn addition to harvesting distant stars, Hooper also discusses the possibility of detecting alien civilizations by monitoring the radiation emitted by star-harvesting civilizations, which would exhibit unique light signatures due to the altered starlight spectra. These signatures could potentially be detected through astronomical observations.\n\nThe article also mentions the concept of \"warped space\" or \"accelerated\" stars, which could be a sign of alien civilizations moving stars to secure their energy. The search for such civilizations might involve identifying unusual galaxies with missing or altered starlight patterns.\n\nIn summary, the search for alien life and advanced civilizations involves understanding the dynamics of the universe's expansion, the need to act quickly to secure star resources, and the potential detection through unique energy signatures. The search for alien civilizations may involve studying the energy output of distant stars and the structures created by advanced civilizations, such as Dyson spheres, to understand their methods and potential traces in the universe.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "The news articles cover various aspects of human evolution and stone age tool-making, with a focus on the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya. Here's a summary of the main findings:\n\n1. Climate-driven tool advancements: Researchers have discovered evidence of tool-making advances and trading networks among Homo sapiens or their relatives around 320,000 years ago in the Olorgesailie Basin. This period, known as the Middle Stone Age, saw the use of larger, specialized tools for foraging over more extensive areas due to unpredictable climate changes, leading to the need for more distant tool procurement and potentially long-distance communication.\n\n2. Tool technology: The shift from earlier, larger stone tools to smaller, more specialized ones, like obsidian-handled spears, suggests a response to changing environmental conditions. The presence of obsidian from distant sources indicates the development of trading networks and the potential for long-distance communication.\n\n3. Evidence of tool exchange: The Olorgesailie tools, including hand axes and obsidian, suggest the existence of trading networks among early humans, possibly leading to the exchange of resources and ideas. This is supported by the discovery of pigment, possibly used for signaling or artistic purposes, which also required the transportation of raw materials over long distances.\n\n4. Shift to the Middle Stone Age: The transition to this new technology coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens, suggesting a connection between environmental pressures and the development of more specialized tool-making.\n\n5. Challenges in understanding: The lack of direct fossil evidence makes it difficult to determine the exact species responsible for the tool-making advancements, and the Olorgesailie period between 499,000 and 320,000 years ago is a gap in the record, leaving questions about the continuity of tool-making practices.\n\n6. Middle Stone Age as a precursor to modern humans: The discoveries challenge the traditional view of a sudden \"human revolution\" occurring outside Africa, suggesting that modern behaviors and innovations were present in the region much earlier than previously thought.\n\nIn summary, the Olorgesailie discoveries indicate a complex interplay between environmental changes, cultural adaptation, and the development of early human societies, challenging the traditional narrative of a sudden \"human revolution\" and highlighting the importance of long-distance trade and cooperation in shaping human history.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes. Prosin, meanwhile, says her group isn't stopping with the chimps and will also target the release of other animals.

{"pred": "The news can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. In 2011, the Justice Department raided the Gibson Guitar Corporation in Tennessee, alleging the company's use of illegally sourced wood, a violation of the Lacey Act. This marked the second such raid, following a previous one in 2009 over an ebony shipment from Madagascar. The company, however, maintains it did not violate any laws and disputes the claims based on evidence provided.\n\n2. The Lacey Act, which addresses the trade of endangered species, including plants, was amended in 2008 to include the import of illegally harvested wood. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson knew the risks and continued to source wood from Madagascar, despite the ban on exports. The company's actions have raised concerns among the guitar industry, with some fearing retroactive enforcement under the Lacey Act could force them to prove the legality of their vintage instruments.\n\n3. The Lacey Act requires end users to verify the legality of their wood supply chains, but the process is not as straightforward as it seems. Andrea Johnson, director of forest programs for the EIA, mentioned that \"certify\" in the context of the law does not necessarily involve third-party certifications or government-recognized proof. Gibson was reportedly conducting a fact-finding trip to Madagascar to assess sourcing possibilities, but the company continued to source wood despite knowing the risks.\n\n4. Chris Martin, CEO of the C.F. Martin Guitar Company, supports the Lacey Act, believing it helps combat illegal logging. However, attorneys representing guitar makers, like Ron Bienstock, warn about the retroactive nature of the law, which could affect the trade of vintage instruments.\n\n5. The internet archive, which receives data donated by Alexa since 1996, plays a role in preserving web content. This includes the historical record of the Gibson raids, providing a snapshot of the legal situation at the time.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the intersection of music, environmental regulation, and the challenges faced by the guitar industry due to the Lacey Act. The ongoing legal battle between Gibson and the government centers on the company's alleged violation of the law and the impact on the guitar market.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

{"pred": "In recent years, Mars has emerged as a more promising location for extraterrestrial life due to the discovery of a massive ancient ocean覆盖 a significant portion of the northern hemisphere, as reported by NASA scientists. A study published in the journal Science revealed that a substantial body of water, comparable to an Earth-sized ocean, covered the planet around 4.5 billion years ago. This ancient ocean, which was 10 times larger than the current Martian polar caps, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, and its high concentration of deuterium (D/H) suggests a global water layer up to 137 meters deep.\n\nThe deuterium enrichment found in certain basins and high-altitude regions suggests that water on Mars was highly enriched, reaching up to 8 times the Earth's deuterium content, or \"VSMOW.\" This enrichment, combined with the detection of heavy water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, indicates that Mars may have had a more habitable environment in its youth.\n\nThe presence of a global ocean on Mars challenges previous assumptions about the planet's water history, as it was previously believed that Mars had experienced less consistent water flow and no long-lasting seas. The study, conducted using advanced telescopes, analyzed the seasonal variations in water molecules and the concentration of deuterium, which showed that Mars lost a significant amount of its normal hydrogen (ordinary hydrogen) due to atmospheric escape, leaving behind a higher proportion of deuterium.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient ocean raises the possibility of past habitability on Mars, sparking interest in the search for signs of life. However, Mars' current arid conditions and the loss of much of its water have led some scientists to speculate that the planet's habitability may have been limited to specific regions and time periods.\n\nMethane on Mars, detected by the Curiosity rover, has also been a topic of discussion, with some speculating it could be a sign of life, but further investigation is needed to confirm this connection.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights Mars' potential for ancient water and the importance of understanding the planet's past water cycle and its implications for the existence of life. The search for life on Mars is expected to intensify with upcoming missions, such as the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which aims to explore the planet's subsurface for signs of microbial life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

This comes after a long legal battle between Nestlé and rival chocolate manufacturer Mondelez, with Nestlé arguing that the unique shape was distinctive enough to be protected as a trademark. However, the court found that Nestlé failed to prove its shape is recognizable across all EU countries, and the EU's Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must reconsider its decision. The ruling has implications for other brands operating in the EU, as it highlights the need for a product's distinctiveness to be recognized in all markets within the single market. Nestlé, however, maintains that the KitKat shape remains distinctive and vows to continue its fight. The case is now back at the EU trademark office, where the outcome could still preserve the trademark if the office finds the shape distinctive enough.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision.

{"pred": "Dinosaurs, long associated with ferocious roars in popular culture, may have actually made bird-like sounds, according to new research. A study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaurs, particularly large-bodied species, may have produced sounds similar to those of today's birds, such as coos or mumbles, rather than the loud, high-pitched screams often imagined. The iconic \"Jurassic Park\" T. rex roar, created in a sound studio, was not based on actual dinosaur vocalizations. Instead, it combined elements from various animals like baby elephant cries, tiger chuffs, and a gurgling alligator. Some dinosaurs, like the cooing of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich, could have been their natural vocalizations. The lack of fossil evidence for dinosaur sounds makes understanding their actual vocalizations challenging, but the study points to the possibility that large-bodied dinosaurs, like birds, may have had closed-mouth vocalizations, which could have been used in mating displays. These findings challenge the common perception of dinosaurs as roaring beasts and suggest that their vocalizations might have been more subtle and bird-like.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

In the case of Flight 447, Bayesian calculations helped narrow down the search area after initial efforts failed.\n\nIn the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 case, Bayesian inference helps investigators update their probability estimates based on new information, such as the likelihood of a deliberate disappearance and the plane's flight path. The search involves considering multiple factors, like wind and ocean currents, to determine the probability of the plane's location. However, the complexity of the situation, including the possibility of the plane being damaged or the likelihood of different scenarios, makes Bayesian calculations more challenging and less reliant on Bayes' Rule, which is better suited for refining probabilities based on new evidence rather than drastic changes in the situation.\n\nWhile Bayesian methods have not been officially used by the Malaysian authorities, they are being supported by French investigators who have used similar techniques in the past. The search for the missing plane remains a difficult task due to the vastness of the ocean and the need to account for incomplete search records.\n\nIn summary, Bayesian statistics, though not a perfect match for the current Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 case, offers a structured approach to integrating new information and adjusting search strategies, making it a valuable tool in the ongoing search for the missing aircraft.

Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "On Wednesday evening, a car was involved in an unusual incident in Mendon, where it was suspended from a telephone guy wire due to a driver reacting too quickly to a GPS unit's unexpected turn-around instructions. Nabila Altahan, the driver of the Toyota Corolla, experienced a momentary loss of control when the GPS directed her to turn around despite the vehicle being already past its destination. Fortunately, neither Altahan nor her passenger were injured in the incident.\n\nState Police reported that the car left the lane of Route 4 in Mendon while attempting to follow the GPS guidance, causing it to veer off the road and onto the telephone pole. The driver's quick reaction led to the unusual situation, with the car hanging precariously from the wire. When the incident was witnessed by Ray Ault, a passerby, he immediately called for help, and both State Police and Rutland City Fire Department arrived promptly to the scene.\n\nThe situation was quickly resolved, with the car being safely removed from the pole by emergency services. This incident serves as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of relying too heavily on GPS navigation without considering real-time traffic conditions.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP. Police say 30-year-old Nabila Altahan of Dorchester, Mass., was headed west on US Route 4 when she passed her intended destination and reacted quickly to the instructions, leaving the road at a significant enough speed to propel the vehicle up the wires. She wasn't injured. (This driver followed her GPS into a lake.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 310}

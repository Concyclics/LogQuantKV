In the emotional letter, Kalashnikov, who had recently converted to Christianity, questioned whether he was responsible for the deaths of those killed by his weapon, despite his initial intention to design it for defending his country during World War II. The letter, which was published by Izvestia, reveals a shift in his perspective, acknowledging the pain his invention caused, especially considering its widespread use by terrorists and criminals.\n\nKalashnikov's letter reflects on the moral dilemma he faced, as the simplicity and effectiveness of the AK-47 led to its proliferation and misuse. The rifle, which has been estimated to have been produced in excess of 100 million units worldwide, became a symbol of both pride and regret for its creator. Despite receiving numerous state honors, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour, Kalashnikov expressed sadness over its use by criminals and in conflicts beyond its original purpose.\n\nNotably, Kalashnikov's religious conversion and baptism late in life seem to have played a role in his introspection. The Russian Orthodox Church, represented by Patriarch Kirill, acknowledged the weapon's dual purpose, supporting its creation when it serves to defend the nation but not condoning its use for malicious ends.

Users can disable voice recognition and limit data collection, but the similarity to George Orwell's 1984, where telescreens monitored citizens, has sparked担忧 about the internet of things and data collection by companies.\n\nMicrosoft's Xbox One presentation revealed a feature that allows the console to be always listening, responding to voice commands, potentially raising privacy concerns. The updated Kinect can even detect heartbeats and process audio personalized to individuals, leading to speculation about surveillance and data security. While Microsoft claims it listens only when prompted, like with the 'Xbox On' command, the constant connectivity and sensitivity of the device could be seen as intrusive.\n\nBoth Samsung and Microsoft's smart devices emphasize the convenience of voice and gesture controls, but their privacy policies have sparked discussions about the balance between functionality and user privacy. Users are encouraged to review privacy settings and be cautious about the information shared with these devices. Companies, like Microsoft, have been asked to clarify safeguards against potential misuse of collected data.", "answers": ["Own a Samsung smart TV?

The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7 during the 2014 outbreak, and symptoms typically begin with fever and respiratory illness, followed by paralysis.\n\nAFM cases have been reported in at least 17 states, with some experts suggesting a potential link to enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), which circulated in 2014 during a large EV-D68 outbreak. However, no definitive cause has been established, and the 2014 outbreak was initially associated with EV-D68, though no evidence of the virus in AFM cases has been confirmed this year. The condition remains rare, with only a small percentage of cases recovering fully.\n\nThe CDC is urging vigilance and monitoring, as the number of cases has risen steadily since April, with some experts fearing a repeat of the 2014 outbreak. Treatment options are limited to supportive care, and recovery depends largely on the initial severity of paralysis. The condition is particularly concerning due to the lack of understanding about its cause, duration, and long-term implications.\n\nParents and healthcare professionals are expressing concern, with some physicians reporting new cases resembling the 2014 outbreak. The CDC is investigating the possibility of enterovirus D68 or other enteroviruses as potential triggers, though no definitive connection has been made. The CDC is emphasizing the importance of hygiene to prevent the spread of any potential causative agents.\n\nAffected families, like the Roberts and Andersen households, are grappling with the sudden onset and long-term effects of AFM. While some cases have shown improvement with time, the majority of children recover only partially, highlighting the need for more research and potential treatments.\n\nThe situation has prompted a call for increased awareness, surveillance, and collaboration among health agencies to better understand the condition and develop preventive or therapeutic strategies.

Following Rapp's disclosure, numerous other individuals, including fellow actors, a bartender, and a production assistant, have come forward with similar accounts of harassment, assault, or attempted rape, some dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nSpacey's alleged misconduct includes unwanted advances, predatory behavior, and creating a toxic work environment. In response to the mounting allegations, Netflix severed ties with him, and a House of Cards investigation found a \"toxic atmosphere\" on set. The scandal widened when it was revealed that Spacey had apologized to Rapp while simultaneously denying any wrongdoing, which led to criticism from the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nOne of Spacey's co-stars, Harry Dreyfuss, recounted an incident where Spacey allegedly molested him in front of his father, while other accusers described drunken encounters, unwanted sexual advances, and attempts to silence them. The allegations range from 1986 to 2016, and authorities are reportedly investigating some of these claims.\n\nThe severity of the allegations has led to calls for accountability and prompted discussions about the #MeToo movement and the treatment of sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry. Spacey's representatives have acknowledged the need for evaluation and treatment, but he has not directly addressed all the accusations. The impact of these revelations has led to significant changes in his professional life, including the replacement of Spacey in the film \"All the Money in the World\" with Christopher Plummer.", "answers": ["A former Boston TV news anchor says that last year, when her son was 18, he was at a bar in Natucket, Mass., when he met Kevin Spacey.

The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

Traditional loans often involve lengthy procedures and credit checks, while paperless payday loans and no credit check options are becoming popular for their expedited approval process. These loans cater to urgent financial needs like medical expenses, utility bills, and other unforeseen costs. Interest rates and fees should be carefully considered, with short-term loans like installment payday loans having longer repayment periods with lower monthly installments.\n\nEmergency funds are recommended as a cheaper alternative, but those with poor credit history can still access loans, although their terms might be influenced by credit checks. Lenders often have certain eligibility criteria, such as age, employment, and income requirements. Online applications and lack of credit checks simplify the loan application process, making it more accessible.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the need for fast cash solutions, the varying loan options available (including those with quick approvals and those with extended repayment terms), and the importance of considering the costs and terms when choosing a financial aid option.

In 2015, the number of permits for the full trail reached 3,000, and the trend continued in 2016, with permits indicating a potential overflow of hikers. The surge is attributed to both the book and the film, which showcase the transformative power of the trail, inspiring many to embark on a challenging journey.\n\nThe hike, particularly the 2,650-mile trail from Mexico to Canada, has traditionally attracted around 300 thru-hikers annually, but the recent boom has led to concerns about overcrowding and its potential impact on the environment, infrastructure, and fellow hikers. The PCTA introduced a permit system with a daily cap of 50 permits per day to manage the growing numbers and minimize trail degradation. This measure aims to protect fragile desert ecosystems and prevent excessive human pressure on the trail.\n\nThe surge in popularity has led to discussions about the trail's future, with fears that the increasing numbers could change the experience for the worse. Experienced hikers, like Cheryl Strayed, have shared their stories of personal growth, but inexperienced hikers without proper preparation pose risks to themselves and the trail's integrity. The PCTA encourages prospective hikers to be adequately prepared and mindful of their impact, emphasizing the importance of Leave No Trace principles.\n\nThe success of \"Wild\" has inspired not only more hikers but also a shift in demographics, with women reportedly making up a larger portion of the trail users. The PCTA has launched campaigns promoting responsible hiking practices, such as the #responsiblywild hashtag, to ensure the trail's sustainability.\n\nAs the popularity of the PCT continues to rise, the trail community faces the delicate balance between preserving the wilderness experience and accommodating the growing demand.

To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

This dinosaur, with feathers resembling those of modern hummingbirds, had rainbow-colored plumage, making it the first dinosaur with iridescent feathers. The fossil, found in Hebei Province, showcases a mix of dark feathers and iridescent ones, particularly on the head, neck, and chest. The dinosaur had a theropod-like body, Velociraptor-like features, and a crested head, but its feathers suggest a more colorful Jurassic World than previously imagined.\n\nCaihong's feathers, analyzed using microstructure, indicate the presence of melanosomes, supporting the conclusion that the dinosaur had vibrant, iridescent colors. The dinosaur's feathers were not only colorful but also displayed asymmetrical vanes, suggesting a possible role in flight or display, although its ability to fly is debated. The dinosaur's unique features, such as the lacrimal crests and the combination of bird-like and dinosaurian traits, make it a significant find in understanding the evolution of feathered dinosaurs.\n\nThe discovery challenges our understanding of dinosaur plumage and provides insights into the diversity of colors and functions in prehistoric times. While Caihong's feathers were not widespread, like those of the dinosaur's tail, which featured large rectrices, the presence of alula-like feathers on the pollex and similarities to the alula in Microraptor hint at the potential for complex display mechanisms. The study also highlights the diversity of feathered dinosaurs, with Caihong's feathers resembling those of hummingbirds and suggesting that iridescence may have evolved independently multiple times in early paravians.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Caihong juji pushes the boundaries of our knowledge about dinosaur biology and the origins of avian traits, providing a vivid snapshot of a world where dinosaurs adorned themselves with vibrant colors and possibly used feathers for both display and possibly flight, marking a significant step in the evolution of feathered dinosaurs.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

However, the tax faced significant backlash, with critics arguing that it doesn't improve public health, drives consumers to the suburbs, and creates a regressive tax that unites diverse opposition. Seattle's mayor, Ed Murray, had initially promoted the tax as a progressive measure, but its effects on prices, like a $15.99 Gatorade case increasing to $26.33, sparked public anger and protests.\n\nRetailers like Costco responded by informing customers about the higher prices and directing them to neighboring areas where the tax is not applicable. The tax's lack of success was evident in Cook County, which repealed its soda tax within two months due to public uproar. Seattle's exclusion of milk-based beverages from the tax and the subsequent price hikes have led to calls for consistency and questions about the fairness of the tax.\n\nThe tax's impact on businesses, like Costco's 38% decline in sales, prompted retailers to lose customers and face legal battles. The tax's opponents argue that it doesn't address health concerns effectively and instead pushes the financial burden onto consumers, potentially hurting low-income households.\n\nSeattle's experience highlights the challenges of implementing such policies, as seen in other cities like Philadelphia and Cook County, where taxes on sugary beverages have faced strong opposition and unintended consequences.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The study, conducted on 64,000 Danish children, observed a correlation between acetaminophen use and a 29% increased risk of ADHD when taken chronically or for extended periods.\n\nWhile the study does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, it suggests that pregnant women may want to reconsider frequent use of acetaminophen, especially for managing fever and pain during flu-like illnesses.

While Neiman Marcus' breach started in July, it was not fully contained until January, raising questions about the timing of the disclosure.\n\nBoth breaches involved sophisticated tactics, with the malware using memory scraping and covert methods to evade detection. The Target breach compromised an estimated 40 million credit and debit card accounts, with the potential for further attacks using similar methods, as warned by the iSight report. The authorities are actively investigating the connections between the two breaches, with state attorneys general from multiple states leading the probe.\n\nIn conclusion, these incidents underscore the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks on retailers, exposing vulnerabilities in their systems and raising concerns about the potential for future breaches.

His supporters, including his daughter Arnelle, testified in his favor. Simpson's parole was based on his good behavior, lack of prior convictions, and support from family and community. Despite his denial of direct responsibility, Simpson acknowledged the involvement of others and expressed regret for their actions.\n\nThe granting of parole reignited interest in Simpson's story, which was explored in documentaries like \"O.J.: Made in America\" and \"The People v.

This shift, as seen in a study by the University of Michigan, challenges current guidelines recommending screenings begin at age 50. The study, which analyzed data from 1998 to 2011, found that younger patients were more likely to have advanced tumors, with higher rates of regional or distant malignancies, and were treated more aggressively.\n\nYounger patients were diagnosed with more advanced stages of the disease but had slightly longer survival rates due to more intensive treatments. They were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs 63% for older patients) and receive radiation therapy (53% vs 48%). The study highlights the need for earlier risk assessment and screening among younger adults, as the number of cases is expected to rise, particularly by 2030.\n\nThe findings prompt a call to action for the medical community to be vigilant for colorectal cancer symptoms in younger patients, as signs like anemia, changes in bowel movements, and dark stool may be overlooked. While the exact reasons for the increase in younger patients are not fully understood, factors like lifestyle choices and environmental influences may play a role.\n\nDr. Chan from Harvard Medical School cautions against altering guidelines too soon, as the evidence for earlier screening is not yet conclusive. However, he emphasizes the importance of considering family history and risk factors when deciding on screening.\n\nIn conclusion, colorectal cancer is increasingly affecting younger demographics, requiring healthcare providers to adapt their approach and encourage earlier screenings, especially for those with high-risk factors.

At the Warratyi rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a chance discovery by archaeologist Giles Hamm and aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard revealed a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, challenging the conventional timeline of human presence in Australia. The site contains sophisticated tools, bone fragments, and evidence of interactions with megafauna like the Diprotodon optatum, suggesting an earlier colonization than previously believed. The presence of burnt eggshells, ochre use, and dated artefacts push the development of key technologies, such as stone axes and bone tools, to earlier than 46,000 years ago. The discovery implies that humans could have reached the southern interior earlier than previously estimated, possibly as early as 49,000 to 60,000 years ago, indicating a rapid expansion of habitation across the continent. The site, particularly Warratyi, showcases the oldest known evidence of human settlement in the arid zone, suggesting that the harsh conditions were not a significant barrier for early humans.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through resource acquisition and energy harvesting.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's theory proposes a three-step progression for civilizations seeking to dominate the universe. The first step involves utilizing a planet's resources (Type I), followed by harnessing a star's energy (Type II), and eventually capturing energy from an entire galaxy (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that civilizations must actively capture energy from distant stars to prevent being isolated due to the expanding universe's dark energy. As space expands, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible, necessitating proactive measures to secure energy sources.\n\nHooper argues that advanced civilizations, aware of the cosmic horizon's effects, would actively seek to harvest stars by deploying massive structures like Dyson spheres, which consist of solar-powered satellites forming a swarm around a star to capture and transmit its energy. This would enable them to counteract the isolation brought about by the accelerating expansion of the universe.\n\nOlaf Stapledon's science fiction and physicist Freeman Dyson's theories suggest that ancient, advanced civilizations would construct elaborate energy-harvesting structures, such as Dyson spheres or statites (hovering satellites). These megastructures could be detected by their waste heat and unusual light signatures, like a galaxy with starlight dominated by energy-rich massive stars.\n\nWhile humans are currently at a relatively early stage (Type I), Dyson's models predict that civilizations could progress to Type II and III, potentially reaching the point where they manipulate stars themselves. The quest for interstellar energy security and the search for alien life intertwine, with the possibility of observing Dyson spheres or unusual galaxies as signs of advanced civilizations at work.\n\nIn summary, the news revolves around the scientific and speculative ideas surrounding the expansion of civilizations, their pursuit of energy resources, and the implications of cosmic isolation. The quest for survival and growth in the face of an ever-expanding universe drives the need for advanced technologies like Dyson spheres, with potential observable signatures offering clues to the existence of other intelligent life forms.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Marketing chief Phil Schiller's explanation, which was met with ridicule on social media, was criticized for using the term \"courage\" to justify a move that alienated users. The decision to eliminate the headphone jack was seen as arrogant, greedy, and potentially stupid, as it replaced a widely-used and high-quality audio standard with a proprietary Lightning connector.\n\nUsers expressed frustration over the loss of compatibility with various devices, the need for expensive dongles, and the inconvenience of charging and using headphones simultaneously. The elimination of the headphone jack was deemed unnecessary, with critics pointing out that wired audio still generally sounded superior to wireless options like Bluetooth or Apple's AirPods, which required an iCloud account for proper functionality. The move was likened to previous controversial decisions like removing the CD drive or 30-pin connector, but without the same technological justification.\n\nApple's decision was criticized for prioritizing their own ecosystem over user convenience, breaking the \"it just works\" principle that Apple had previously championed.

Despite his tumultuous past, including living in poverty, constant abuse, and being two grades behind academically due to dyslexia, Cruz began to change under Hooper's guidance. He started helping with tasks in her classroom, and their relationship evolved into a bond that transcended their roles as teacher and student.\n\nHooper's home became a sanctuary for Cruz, who faced further abuse at home. After a particularly violent incident, Cruz's mother asked Hooper to temporarily care for him when his stepfather kicked him out at the age of 12. Linda, recognizing the opportunity to provide stability, decided to adopt Cruz, despite initial skepticism from others. Over time, Cruz improved academically, tested out of special education, and eventually graduated from high school.\n\nIn January 1998, at the age of 29, Cruz formally adopted Linda and Gale Hooper as his legal parents, legally changing his name to Cruz Hooper.

The Supreme Court has been involved in cases challenging these detentions, with the latest ruling potentially affecting the fate of Guantanamo detainees and the broader implications for due process.\n\nIn a groundbreaking development, a New York court recently granted a writ of habeas corpus to two chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, at Stony Brook University, making them the first animals in U.S. history to receive such a legal order. This unprecedented decision allows them to have their detention reviewed in court, potentially paving the way for legal recognition of their personhood and arguing for their release. Animal rights groups, like the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP), are using this ruling as a basis to challenge the treatment of chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals in captivity, with plans to file more cases involving elephants, great apes, and cetaceans.\n\nThese news passages highlight the erosion of habeas corpus protections and the ongoing struggle to extend legal rights to non-human entities, pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a legal subject under the law. The cases raise questions about the balance between executive power and individual liberties, with potential long-term implications for the future of animal rights and the application of habeas corpus principles.", "answers": ["The writ of habeas corpus lets prisoners appear in court to make their captors justify why they're being held.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Gibson CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, maintained that the company had purchased the wood legally, but the government claimed that emails and seized documents suggested the company was aware of the potential illegality of the supply chain.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) director, Andrea Johnson, stated that the Lacey Act requires end-users to verify the legality of their wood sources, but Gibson was accused of possibly sourcing from Madagascar despite the export ban on ebony.

{"pred": "Recent studies based on observations of Mars' atmosphere have revealed significant discoveries about the planet's ancient water history. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a substantial portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, up to a mile deep in some areas, persisted for millions of years, providing a warm and wet environment that could have supported the potential for life.\n\nThe water on Mars had a higher concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, due to the gradual leakage of ordinary hydrogen into space, leaving behind a higher proportion of deuterium. This indicates extensive water loss, with the inferred global ocean depth being around 137 meters. The ocean was likely centered in the low-lying northern plains, covering about a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe presence of this ancient ocean suggests Mars was more habitable than previously thought, withstanding for billions of years. Observations like those from NASA's Curiosity rover and the use of advanced telescopes have provided evidence of standing bodies of water, rivers, and possibly even seas, which could have facilitated the possibility of life. However, determining whether life ever existed on Mars remains speculative, with ongoing research suggesting that the conditions were conducive to life at some point in the planet's history.\n\nAs the search for life on Mars intensifies, future missions, such as the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, will continue to explore the planet's past environments and search for signs of past or present biological activity. While the evidence points to a wetter and more habitable Mars in its past, the definitive presence of life remains an open question.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Nestlé had been attempting to maintain a trademark on the shape of its Kit Kat since 2002, claiming it was distinctive enough to be protected. However, the court ruled that the shape alone does not confer sufficient distinctiveness to warrant trademark protection, as it must be recognized as distinctive in every EU country, not just a significant part of it. This decision annuls Nestlé's appeal and sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) for reconsideration.\n\nThe ruling affects not only Kit Kat but also other similar products like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which has a similar four-fingered design. The case highlights the challenge for companies to prove their products' uniqueness across the entire EU, rather than just a significant portion. While Nestlé believes it still has a case to present stronger evidence, the current ruling suggests the trademark office may need to reevaluate the shape's distinctiveness.\n\nSimultaneously, the case has broader implications for trademark law, particularly for chocolate manufacturers, as it sets a precedent for evaluating the distinctiveness of product shapes. The ruling could lead to further scrutiny of existing trademarks, such as Toblerone's shape and Cadbury's purple wrapper color, which were previously registered based on different criteria.\n\nThis legal battle has attracted attention due to its potential impact on the chocolate industry and the perception of Brexit, as some have seen it as an example of perceived EU interference in British traditions.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic roar of the T. rex, suggesting that dinosaurs, including the mighty predator, likely made sounds quite different from what we see in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" According to a study published in the journal Evolution, dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies like birds, might have produced closed-mouth vocalizations akin to cooing or a muffled roar, unlike the cinematic roars associated with dinosaurs. The study, involving researchers from various institutions, analyzed the vocalizations of living and extinct animals, including birds and crocodiles, to uncover patterns in closed-mouth sounds.\n\nThe research found that closed-mouth vocalizations, resembling cooing or a low-pitched mumble, were produced by birds with large air sacs, such as doves or ostriches, during mating displays or territorial calls. The study suggests that the T. rex's roar, heard in movies like \"Jurassic Park,\" was likely a creative blend of various animal sounds, including baby elephant cries, tiger growls, and an alligator's gurgle, rather than a dinosaur's natural vocalization.\n\nWhile the exact dinosaur sounds remain uncertain due to lack of fossil evidence, the study points to a connection between birds and dinosaurs, with both groups potentially sharing similar vocal mechanisms. The researchers propose that dinosaurs, especially those with large bodies, might have produced low-frequency, throaty sounds like a coo or a mumble, similar to ostriches or cassowaries.\n\nThe Jurassic World franchise, including the velociraptors, drew upon real-life animal sounds for its dinosaur effects. The raptors' vocalizations featured a tortoise's mating call, a goose's hiss, and even a baby elephant's breath for the T. rex's roar. The team mixed these sounds to create the iconic movie moments.\n\nThe study highlights the limitations of reconstructing dinosaur vocalizations, as most dinosaur vocal organs would not have fossilized. However, the findings suggest that dinosaurs, especially those with large bodies, might have had the ability to produce bird-like closed-mouth sounds, challenging the traditional roar associated with these ancient beasts.\n\nIn conclusion, the research contributes to our understanding of dinosaur vocalizations, emphasizing the importance of studying living birds to infer possible dinosaur sounds. It opens up intriguing possibilities for dinosaur communication, revealing that the world of dinosaurs was not as simple as Hollywood portrays, with a rich variety of vocal expressions waiting to be deciphered.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The search initially started with statistical tools like Bayesian analysis, which helps estimate the probability of the plane's location considering its last known position, communication-system shutdown, and the likelihood of a deliberate diversion.\n\nIn the case of Flight 447, Bayesian methods played a crucial role in narrowing down the search after initial failures. The search for Air France Flight 447 initially involved complex calculations, including estimating the probability of beacon detection and accounting for potential damage to the black boxes. The search area was adjusted multiple times, ultimately leading to the discovery of the wreckage.\n\nHowever, the search for Flight 370 presents additional challenges due to the new evidence suggesting a deliberate act, which shifts the probability towards areas farther from the takeoff point. Bayesian methods are still being employed, but the search experts acknowledge the difficulty in updating probabilities with limited historical data and the need to account for subjective judgment.\n\nWhile Bayesian statistics were instrumental in the past, experts debate the effectiveness in the current situation. Some argue that the search area is vast and the circumstances have changed significantly, making Bayesian techniques less suitable. Others, like Tony O'Hagan, believe Bayesian methods are adaptable and can handle changing information, even if the input of subjective judgment is necessary.\n\nThe hunt for Flight 370's wreckage faces challenges due to the lack of concrete evidence and the vastness of the search area.

Mubarak's trial, which resumes after a two-month break, focuses on his role in suppressing protests and the violence against protesters during his tenure.\n\nThe election results are crucial as they determine the balance of power in the new parliament, with the possibility of an Islamist-dominated legislature. The military, currently in control, faces opposition from both the Brotherhood and pro-revolutionary forces. Economic challenges, including a decline in foreign reserves and a struggling stock market, loom large in the backdrop of these political developments.\n\nIn the Mubarak trial, the prosecution painted a damning picture, accusing the former president of attempting to install his son, Gamal, as his successor and committing violence against Egyptians. The court heard that Mubarak's regime was corrupt and oppressive, with the prosecutor demanding a severe penalty for the ex-leader.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood, despite its electoral strength, remains open to forming a coalition or unity government to balance power, aiming to prevent an all-Islamist administration. However, their potential majority could limit the influence of rival parties and reshape the political landscape. The trial of Mubarak and his sons, including Gamal, continues, with the prosecution seeking to hold them accountable for the violence during the protests that led to their downfall.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "On Wednesday evening, an unusual incident occurred in Mendon when a Toyota Corolla driven by Nabila Altahan became suspended from a telephone pole after an unexpected GPS navigation command. The driver, following her GPS directions too hastily, veered off the road when her GPS directed her to turn around abruptly because she had already passed her destination, which was a nearby point. The car climbed the wire support of a telephone pole near the Sugar & Spice Restaurant on Route 4. Fortunately, both Altahan and her passenger sustained no injuries during the accident.\n\nWitnesses at the scene, including a minature golf course patron, observed the driver quickly exit the vehicle as it dangled from the wire. Local authorities, such as the State Police and Rutland City Fire Department, responded promptly to the strange situation, resolving the matter without further incident. The incident serves as a reminder of the potential hazards when relying too heavily on GPS guidance, especially when drivers need to exercise caution and adapt to real-time situations on the road.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP. Police say 30-year-old Nabila Altahan of Dorchester, Mass., was headed west on US Route 4 when she passed her intended destination and reacted quickly to the instructions, leaving the road at a significant enough speed to propel the vehicle up the wires. She wasn't injured. (This driver followed her GPS into a lake.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 310}

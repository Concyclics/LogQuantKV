As of August 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 50 cases across 24 states, more than double the number from 2015. AFM primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and is characterized by rapid muscle weakness, often following a viral infection.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak, which saw 120 cases, was linked to enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a common virus that usually causes mild respiratory infections. While the CDC did not find EV-D68 in all 2014 AFM cases, it remains a suspect in the current surge. In 2016, AFM cases were not exclusively linked to EV-D68, with limited detections of the virus in some instances.\n\nAFM affects the spinal cord, leading to symptoms like limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing, and slurred speech. There is no specific treatment, and recovery varies widely, with partial recovery in most cases and full recovery in only a minority. The cause of AFM is still uncertain, and more research is needed to understand its triggers and effective treatments.\n\nPhysicians are concerned about the potential for a repeat of the 2014 outbreak, as cases have been reported in multiple states, including California, Massachusetts, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia. Parents and healthcare professionals are advised to maintain good hygiene, update vaccinations, and be vigilant for symptoms in children.\n\nAffected families, like the Roberts and Carson families, have faced the challenge of grappling with the sudden onset of the illness and the uncertainty of its long-term effects. Rehabilitation and ongoing medical support are crucial for affected children, as seen in the improvements experienced by some, like 6-year-old Laura Carson.\n\nAs the CDC investigates, the urgency to understand AFM and develop preventive measures or targeted therapies is underscored by the distress it causes to parents and the potential long-term impact on affected children's lives.", "answers": ["At first, it seemed like 4-year-old Laura Carson was suffering from a simple headache.

From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully. A CDC study found 68% of patients had a fever and 81% had a respiratory illness before AFM symptoms appeared.

Their study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found that the patterns on the shroud do not match the expected flow of blood from a crucifixion victim.\n\nThe researchers tested various positions, such as blood flow from wounds on the hand, forearms, torso, and waist, replicating the conditions that would have occurred if the cloth were a genuine burial shroud. They observed discrepancies in the angles and consistency of the stains, which do not align with the positions of a crucified or hanging person. For instance, the blood flow from the spear wound and the lower back stain were inconsistent with the shroud's depiction.\n\nThe investigation suggests that the stains on the Shroud of Turin may have been created by a standing model rather than a crucified individual, pointing to a possible medieval forgery.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

In 2016, the trail saw a significant increase in inquiries, permit requests, and hikers attempting the full 2,650-mile trek from Mexico to Canada. The release of \"Wild\" has led to a rise in both male and female hikers, with women's participation increasing from less than 10% to around 30%. The surge has prompted concerns about overcrowding, environmental impact, and the potential for resource depletion.\n\nTo address these issues, the Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) introduced a permit system in 2015, limiting daily hiker numbers to 50, aiming to distribute the load and minimize trail damage, particularly in desert areas. Despite efforts to manage the growing numbers, there have been discussions about the long-term sustainability of the trail, as well as the possibility of future restrictions.\n\nHiking the PCT has become a transformative experience for many, with the Latin phrase \"solvitur ambulando\" (translated as \"it is solved by walking\") reflecting the therapeutic nature of the journey. However, the increasing popularity also brings the risk of inexperienced hikers embarking on the trail without proper preparation, potentially endangering themselves and the environment. The PCTA, with the support of Cheryl Strayed, has launched a campaign promoting safety and responsible hiking practices, known as #responsiblywild.\n\nAs the trail's fame grows, other movies like \"A Walk in the Woods\" based on Bill Bryson's book are expected to further attract hikers.

To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said.

The dinosaur, with its vibrant iridescent feathers, is believed to have had rainbow-like colors, similar to those of hummingbirds. The feathers were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, revealing nanostructures consistent with melanosomes, suggesting the dinosaur's plumage displayed a range of vivid hues.\n\nCaihong had a crow-sized body, a Velociraptor-like skull, and sharp teeth, making it a two-legged predator. It possessed crests above its eyes and had a mix of feather types, including asymmetrical ones, which are thought to have played a role in aerodynamic locomotion. While its feathers were likely not for flight, they could have served as a means of attracting mates and providing insulation.\n\nThe dinosaur's discovery challenges previous assumptions about the colorfulness of the Jurassic world and provides insights into the evolution of paravian feathers. It is the earliest-known creature with asymmetrical feathers, indicating their potential role in flight earlier than previously thought. Caihong's feathers were particularly prominent on its head, neck, and chest, with colors shifting in the light.\n\nFeather preservation on the dinosaur's body, including the head, chest, and tail, revealed a mix of different feather types, from long and linear to sinuous and pennaceous. The presence of feathers on the dinosaur's limbs, particularly the hindlimbs, suggests a more complex feather distribution than previously observed in other non-avialan theropods.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji pushes the boundaries of our understanding of dinosaur biology and the role of feathers in prehistoric life.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Researchers found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen, like Tylenol, had a higher likelihood of their children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related issues later in life. The study, conducted on over 64,000 Danish children, observed a 29% increased risk of ADHD and a 37% increased risk of hyperkinetic syndrome in children whose mothers reported regular use of the drug.\n\nWhile the researchers emphasize that occasional use may not pose significant risks, they advise against chronic or long-term consumption until more research is done. The study's authors suggest that acetaminophen might interfere with fetal brain development, possibly through hormonal effects, though they acknowledge that the cause-and-effect relationship is not yet clear. Other factors, such as viral infections or genetic predispositions, could also play a role.\n\nDr. Beate Ritz, lead researcher, advises pregnant women to consider alternative methods for pain relief, like massages, baths, or acupuncture, instead of relying heavily on acetaminophen.

The sixth-century C.E. container, adorned with crosses, was part of an early Christian basilica and holds great religious significance. The find is particularly noteworthy due to the relic's connection to John the Apostle's reputation for healing, as evidenced by his grave's status as a pilgrimage site for early Christians seeking cures. In addition to the John the Apostle relic, a 10th-century Bulgarian royal seal was uncovered at the fortress, along with other archaeological treasures.\n\nThe reliquary's discovery highlights the importance of Burgas as a historical location, with the ancient and medieval port of Burgos (Poros) serving as a center for Christian pilgrimage in the 6th century. The find echoes previous discoveries, such as the 2010 revelation of relics of St. John the Baptist at an ancient monastery off the coast of Sozopol, Bulgaria. These discoveries shed light on the region's rich religious history and the虔ence with which early Christians revered their saints. The lead tube reliquary, unique in its design and similarities to clay tubes from Ephesus, suggests a connection to the original pilgrimage center for St. John the Theologian.

The planet is estimated to have a mass between five to ten times that of Earth, with a diameter of two to four times Earth's, making it the fifth-largest planet if confirmed.\n\nBrown and his colleague Konstantin Batygin's research initially aimed to disprove the existence of Planet Nine but instead led to a revised model suggesting the gravitational influence of a large, unseen body. The presence of this planet could potentially explain the clustering of certain celestial objects and their orbits. While the planet has not been directly observed, the likelihood of its existence is considered high by some experts, with estimates ranging from 60% to 90%.\n\nNASA's director, Jim Green, cautions that extraordinary evidence is required to confirm the existence of Planet Nine, echoing Carl Sagan's principle. Observations from telescopes worldwide are ongoing in the search for the elusive planet, which could potentially be discovered within the next few years.

The site, found in the Flinders Ranges, challenges the conventional timeline of human settlement in the region, suggesting that Aboriginal Australians reached the southern interior much earlier than previously believed, possibly as early as 55,000 to 60,000 years ago. The discovery includes sophisticated tools, bone fragments from a giant marsupial, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna like the Diprotodon optatum.\n\nThe excavation methods employed were meticulous, involving hand excavation, a 1-meter grid system, and careful recording of artifacts and bone fragments. Optical dating of quartz grains and radiocarbon dating of charcoal and eggshell samples were used to establish a precise chronology. The site pushes back the date of key technological advancements, such as stone axes, bone needles, and ochre usage, to around 49,000 to 46,000 years ago.\n\nThe presence of megafauna remains, including bones and eggs, suggests that humans and these large animals coexisted, raising questions about the role of humans in the extinction of these species. The discovery supports a view that climate change, rather than solely human activity, was not the sole cause of megafauna decline.\n\nThe Warratyi rock shelter, with its rich archaeological findings, contributes to a reevaluation of the narrative surrounding the ingenuity and technological prowess of Indigenous Australians, challenging Eurocentric assumptions about their cultural evolution.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial.

Kardashev's three stages of technological advancement (Type I, II, and III) outline a progression from planetary resource utilization to star and galaxy-scale energy harvesting. Hooper's recent paper, not yet peer-reviewed, highlights the urgency for advanced civilizations to secure energy from distant stars due to the accelerating expansion of the universe caused by dark energy.\n\nAccording to Hooper, civilizations at the Type III stage would be compelled to construct massive structures, such as Dyson spheres or swarms of solar-powered satellites, to capture and harness energy from stars before they become inaccessible. These structures, like Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\"设想 and Freeman Dyson's proposal, involve creating shells or clouds of satellites to stabilize and efficiently collect energy.\n\nHooper suggests that signs of such advanced civilizations could be detected through unusual light signatures, such as galaxies with missing prime stars or those exhibiting shifted spectra due to harvested massive stars. However, current technology may not be capable of detecting these subtle signals from deep space.\n\nWhile humans are still in the early stages of technological development, the possibility of ancient extraterrestrial civilizations with millions of years of experience raises questions about the scale and capabilities of these advanced forms of life.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers, publishing in the journal Science, have found evidence suggesting that dramatic climate shifts around 320,000 years ago played a significant role in driving toolmaking advancements and the potential rise of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. The Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya has revealed the oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, predating previous estimates by tens of thousands of years. These tools, including obsidian spearpoints and specialized blades, indicate increased mobility, resource acquisition, and social networking.\n\nThe考古学家们发现，这些工具的出现可能与气候变化有关，尤其是周期性的干旱和雨量充沛的环境变化，迫使早期人类扩大觅食范围并发展出更精细的工具。研究人员推测，这可能是由于长期气候波动促使人类与其他群体建立联系，进行贸易，以应对食物资源的不确定性。\n\nWhile it is unclear whether Homo sapiens or a related species created these tools, the presence of obsidian from distant locations suggests long-distance trade. The study also uncovers evidence of pigment use, possibly indicating symbolic communication and social status.\n\nThese findings align with genetic evidence placing the origin of Homo sapiens in Africa between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago. They challenge the traditional narrative of a \"human revolution\" occurring around 40,000-50,000 years ago, suggesting that modern behaviors emerged earlier than previously thought, possibly in response to environmental pressures.\n\nHowever, the relationship between these complex behaviors and different hominin species during that time remains to be fully understood.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Marketing chief Phil Schiller defended this decision, claiming it was a \"courageous move\" to improve the device, but his explanation was met with widespread criticism on social media. Critics argued that the decision was arrogant, greedy, and愚蠢, as it eliminated a widely used audio standard and forced users to purchase expensive dongles or rely on inferior wireless options.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack was criticized for lacking a technological justification, with many pointing out that wired connections generally provide better sound quality than wireless. The author, who has followed Apple events since 1998, recounted personal experiences with Bluetooth headphones, acknowledging the convenience of wireless but ultimately preferring high-quality wired options like the Bose QuietComfort 20 headphones.\n\nSchiller's claim that space constraints were the primary reason for the change was questioned, with critics suggesting that the decision prioritized Apple's proprietary ecosystem over user convenience. The removal also affected other devices that relied on the headphone jack, such as Square's credit card reader and various sensors.\n\nThe loss of the \"it just works\" philosophy was evident, as users were now required to adapt to a more封闭 and costly solution. The decision sparked anger among consumers, who felt that Apple was building a \"walled garden\" and passing the costs onto them.\n\nIn summary, Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 generated significant backlash due to perceived arrogance, inconvenience, and the loss of a long-standing industry standard.

The operation was a success, and Kieran expressed delight with his new ears, although he will require a follow-up surgery in six months.\n\nThe surgery, performed by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, highlights the potential of tissue engineering in reconstructive surgery. Researchers at the University College London Institute for Child Health are exploring the use of stem cells to create custom ear frameworks, offering a less invasive alternative to current methods. While this technology is still in its early stages, it holds promise for future treatments. Kieran's story underscores the significant psychological impact such procedures can have on a child's life, improving their self-esteem and overall trajectory.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

{"pred": "Recent discoveries shed new light on the water history of Mars, suggesting that the Red Planet once had a significantly more habitable environment than previously believed. Researchers, using powerful telescopes, have mapped atmospheric water and its deuterated form, revealing a massive ancient ocean that covered nearly half of Mars' northern hemisphere around 4.5 billion years ago. This ocean, up to a mile deep in some areas, held an estimated 20 million cubic kilometers of water, comparable to the Arctic Ocean on Earth.\n\nThe ocean's existence indicates a warmer and wetter Mars during its early days, with persistent bodies of water like lakes, rivers, and deltas. The maps show a substantial loss of water, with a global equivalent layer of at least 137 meters, indicating a vast amount of water loss over time. The isotopic analysis suggests that the planet's polar reservoirs had water ice enriched in deuterium, supporting the idea that Mars once had a more extensive water supply than previously thought.\n\nThe study, published in Science, also challenges previous assumptions about the sporadic presence of water on Mars. Instead, it indicates a more continuous presence, potentially conducive to the origin or proliferation of life. However, determining whether life ever existed on Mars remains speculative, with ongoing missions like the European Space Agency's Exomars rover set to search for chemical signatures of life in 2018.\n\nWhile the findings strengthen the case for habitability on Mars, there is still debate among scientists about the exact amount of water and its impact on the planet's potential for sustaining life. Some argue that the early Martian atmosphere may have had a higher proportion of heavy hydrogen, which could affect the calculations of past water levels. Nevertheless, the accumulating evidence points to Mars as a more favorable environment for life in its past than previously assumed.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

The search initially focused on statistical tools like uniform probability distributions, which were then refined as more details emerged, such as the likelihood of a deliberate diversion.\n\nThe crash of Air France Flight 447 in 2009 provided a real-world example of Bayesian analysis in action. Metron Scientific Solutions, led by Lawrence D. Stone, employed Bayesian methods to analyze data from previous crashes, search patterns, and sensor performance to locate the wreckage. The process involved subjective judgments and multiple iterations, ultimately leading to the discovery of the plane.\n\nHowever, experts debate the suitability of Bayesian techniques in the current search for MH370. While some argue that Bayesian methods are valuable for adapting to changing circumstances, others, like Bradley Efron, express skepticism, stating that drastic changes in the situation may render Bayesian calculations less effective.\n\nDespite the potential benefits, not all airlines or governments, including Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government, have widely adopted Bayesian methods in their search efforts. The hunt for MH370 continues, with statisticians providing guidance, but the chances of locating the plane intact are considered slim, with some experts suggesting the wreckage may never be found.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from the previous year's total by that time. AFM primarily affects children, with symptoms including sudden muscle weakness, paralysis, and in some cases, respiratory issues.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak, which saw 120 cases, was initially linked to enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), but the cause remains uncertain. While EV-D68 cases have not been as prevalent this year, some health officials suspect a resurgence of EV-D68 or other enteroviruses might be contributing to the rise in AFM cases. The condition is particularly concerning due to its rapid progression and lack of effective treatments beyond supportive care.\n\nIn 2014, the CDC began tracking AFM after noticing a correlation with EV-D68, but the connection is not definitive. The disease is extremely rare, with only a small percentage of children recovering fully. Symptoms usually manifest in children under 10 years old, and while most cases occur in late summer and early fall, the recent surge suggests a potential recurrence of the 2014 outbreak.\n\nPhysicians are urging increased vigilance and reporting of cases, as the cause remains elusive. Some doctors have reported improvements with treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and suggest that further research into enteroviruses, such as EV-D68, could lead to understanding and potential treatments. Parents and healthcare professionals are advised to maintain good hygiene to prevent the spread of potential triggers like enteroviruses.\n\nAffected families, like the Roberts and Andersen households, describe the shock and uncertainty of their children's diagnoses, with some experiencing paralysis and long-term disabilities.

In 2015, the number of permits for the full trail reached an unprecedented level, and the trend continued in 2016, with over 4,000 permits issued, reflecting a growing number of both thru-hikers and section-hikers. The surge has prompted concerns about overcrowding, environmental impact, and the potential for resource depletion.\n\nThe PCT, which spans 2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada, has traditionally attracted around 300 thru-hikers annually, but the recent rise in popularity, particularly after the book and film, has led to a 50-per-day permit limit to manage the increasing numbers.

The dinosaur had a mix of dinosaurian and bird-like features, such as a Velociraptor-like skull, but also displayed iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, reminiscent of hummingbird feathers. The presence of melanosomes in the fossilized feathers indicates that the dinosaur's plumage was likely colorful and iridescent, adding a new dimension to the understanding of dinosaur appearances.\n\nCaihong's dinosaurian body and bird-like features, including a possible adaptation for flight, challenge our perception of dinosaur diversity. The dinosaur's small size and probable use of feathers for display purposes, like a potential mating strategy, suggest a more colorful and dynamic world during the Jurassic. The discovery pushes the timeline of iridescence in dinosaurs back, with Caihong's feathers resembling those of modern hummingbirds.\n\nThe study, published in Nature Communications, combines paleontological findings with modern biology to shed light on the evolution of coloration and display mechanisms in early feathered dinosaurs.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Rebekah's presence on the show led to her being removed from the California Department of Justice's missing persons list. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office investigated the case, and after contacting Rebekah, they confirmed her safety.\n\nThe county has a high rate of missing persons reports, with the Humboldt 35 being featured in a newspaper article examining the unusually high number of missing individuals. Factors contributing to this high count include a lenient reporting policy, a transient population due to the cannabis industry, and the possibility of under-reporting as some cases may resolve quickly or involve voluntary disappearances.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office handles a significant number of missing persons cases, with a focus on runaways, particularly among children in foster care. Many cases are resolved relatively quickly, but some remain open, such as the case of 47-year-old Mitchell Hernandez, who disappeared and is still listed as missing.\n\nThe Humboldt County's high rate of missing persons, especially for children, is partly attributed to the transient nature of the cannabis industry workers and the difficulty in locating them due to lack of communication. The local law enforcement acknowledges the challenges in investigating these cases, as some individuals may choose to remain uncontactable for extended periods.\n\nThe Humboldt County's high missing persons rate is not unique to the area; however, the number of cases and the persistence of some cases on databases like NamUs highlight the ongoing efforts to find missing individuals, even after a significant amount of time has passed.

This unseen planet, believed to be between five to four times the size of Earth, is inferred from the unusual orbits of dwarf planets and other small objects. While the planet has not been directly observed, its gravitational pull provides a strong case for its existence.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would rewrite the textbooks, potentially restoring Pluto's status as a planet, as it was once considered the tenth planet before the IAU's reclassification.

Trump defended himself against claims of ties to Russia, stating that he inherited a \"mess\" from the previous administration and denied any coordination with Russian officials during his campaign. He defended his travel ban, asserting that it was not a \"ruse\" and promised a new version would be submitted soon. Trump also discussed the ongoing debate over Russian interference in the election, his stance on immigration, including the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and the need to address issues like the economy, jobs, and the Islamic State (ISIS), which he characterized as a \"small group\" spreading like cancer.\n\nDuring the conference, Trump's demeanor was a mix of frustration, self-assurance, and occasional humor. He lashed out at the media, claiming that the public doesn't trust the press and that he knows when a story is truthful.

Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

At the Warratyi rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a chance discovery by archaeologist Giles Hamm and aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard revealed a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, challenging the conventional timeline of human arrival in Australia. The site, containing sophisticated tools, bone fragments, and evidence of fire, suggests a rapid expansion of human presence, potentially indicating an earlier colonization than previously believed.\n\nThe shelter holds significance as it showcases the presence of humans alongside extinct megafauna like the Diprotodon optatum, providing insights into human-megafauna interactions. The excavation uncovered evidence of early technological advancements, such as sophisticated stone tools, bone technology, and the use of ochre, which were developed locally. The presence of these features at such an early date challenges the notion that these innovations were solely imported from Africa.\n\nThe site's location, some 550 km north of Adelaide, pushes back the estimated arrival of humans in the arid region by around 10,000 years. The discovery supports the theory that climate conditions during the last glacial period allowed for easier migration into the region.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through resource acquisition and energy harvesting.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's theory proposes a three-step progression for civilizations seeking to dominate the universe. The first step involves utilizing a planet's resources (Type I), followed by harnessing a star's energy (Type II), and eventually capturing energy from an entire galaxy (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that civilizations must actively capture energy from distant stars to prevent being isolated due to the expanding universe's dark energy. As space expands, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible, necessitating proactive measures to secure energy sources.\n\nHooper argues that advanced civilizations, aware of their cosmic fate, would strive to build Dyson spheres or other structures like solar-powered satellites (statites) to capture and harness energy from stars. These megastructures, like Olaf Stapledon's \"light-trapping\" gauze or Freeman Dyson's envisioned energy collectors, could be signs of highly evolved societies.\n\nWhile humans are currently at a relatively early stage (Type I), the possibility of alien civilizations, potentially millions of years ahead of us, suggests they might have already reached the later stages of Kardashev's hierarchy. The search for such civilizations could involve observing unusual light signatures, such as galaxies with missing prime stars or Dyson spheres' telltale infrared radiation.\n\nIn summary, the quest for dominance in the universe involves grappling with the cosmic consequences of dark energy and the race against time to secure energy resources before they become inaccessible. The pursuit of advanced technologies, like Dyson spheres, serves as both a scientific speculation and a potential indicator of extraterrestrial life, as seen in science fiction and recent theoretical studies.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "A series of recent discoveries in肯尼亚的Olorgesailie Basin challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors. Researchers, publishing in Science, report on three key findings:\n\n1. Middle Stone Age advancements: Fossil evidence and newly excavated tools, dating back to around 320,000 years ago, suggest dramatic shifts in tool-making and possibly trading networks due to climate fluctuations. The use of obsidian, transported from afar, indicates long-distance interactions among Homo sapiens or their relatives.\n\n2. Technological innovations: The Olorgesailie tools, with their smaller, specialized designs, represent a significant shift from earlier, more primitive tools. These changes, possibly driven by environmental pressures, imply increased adaptability, foraging over larger areas, and the need for resource acquisition through trade.\n\n3. Climate-driven behavioral changes: Researchers attribute the observed tool innovations to the unpredictable nature of food sources due to shifting climate conditions. This period coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens and may indicate the development of complex social networks as a response to environmental variability.\n\n4. Earlier-than-expected milestones: The discoveries push back the timeline for key technological advancements, challenging the traditional narrative of a single \"human revolution\" around 40,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests a gradual process of adaptation and innovation across the continent.\n\n5. Complex cultural shifts: The Olorgesailie findings, along with other African sites, suggest that the development of modern behaviors, such as symbolic art and trade, started much earlier than previously thought. This calls for a reevaluation of the criteria used to distinguish modern humans from their ancestors.\n\nOverall, these studies emphasize the importance of climate change in shaping human behavior and the interconnectedness of early societies, challenging the notion of a single \"revolutionary\" event in human history.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Gibson CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, maintained that the company had purchased the wood legally, but the government claimed that emails and seized documents suggested the company was aware of the potential illegality.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) director, Andrea Johnson, stated that the Lacey Act requires end-users to verify the legality of their wood supply chain, and EIA's investigations indicated that Gibson knowingly imported wood linked to illegal timber harvests. However, Gibson denied these allegations, stating that they had stopped importing wood from Madagascar after the coup that led to concerns about the legitimacy of the government.\n\nThe situation raised concerns among other guitar manufacturers, as the Lacey Act's retroactivity posed potential legal issues for those with imported wood, even if acquired before the amendment. Lawyers warned that the law could affect the provenance of older guitars and the trade of vintage instruments. George Gruhn, a prominent guitar dealer, expressed frustration with the law's impact on the industry, particularly for vintage instruments.\n\nThe case against Gibson remained unresolved, with the company seeking a clear understanding of their compliance and a fair legal process.

{"pred": "Recent studies based on observations of Mars' atmosphere reveal a surprising amount of water and a complex water history on the Red Planet. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a significant portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, which reached depths of up to a mile, persisted for millions of years, providing a potentially habitable environment for life.\n\nThe ocean's existence is inferred from the high concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, in the Martian atmosphere. This indicates extensive water loss over time, with the planet losing enough water to create a global ocean up to 137 meters deep. The water loss occurred primarily due to the thin Martian atmosphere, which allowed water to escape into space.\n\nThe findings challenge previous assumptions about Mars' water history, suggesting a more consistent presence of liquid water, including rivers, deltas, and lakes, compared to earlier beliefs. Mars' wetter past raises the possibility of life existing on the planet, although the search for definitive evidence of past or present life is ongoing.\n\nIn addition to the ancient ocean, Mars' polar regions still hold a significant amount of water, enriched in deuterium, suggesting a substantial water reservoir. The presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere, though not necessarily indicating life, adds to the intrigue about the potential for past or extant biological activity.\n\nAs research continues, the accumulating evidence points to Mars being a more habitable environment in its past, providing a crucial context for future missions and the search for signs of past or extant life on the Red Planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Nestlé, which had been seeking to protect the distinctive shape for over a decade, had initially won a trademark in 2012, but the court ruled that Nestlé failed to provide sufficient evidence that the shape was universally recognized as distinctive across all EU countries. The decision also affects Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, a similar four-fingered chocolate bar, which had been in a long-standing legal battle with Nestlé.\n\nThe ruling states that a trademark must demonstrate distinctiveness in every EU member state, not just a significant part, which was not met by Nestlé's evidence. The case highlights the complexity of trademark laws, with implications for other brands, such as Toblerone's shape and Cadbury's purple wrapper color, which have faced similar legal challenges.\n\nWhile Nestlé plans to continue fighting, the outcome of the case means the Kit Kat shape's EU trademark is currently under threat, potentially opening the door for generic-looking four-fingered chocolate bars in the market.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic roar of the T. rex, suggesting that dinosaurs, including the mighty predator, likely made sounds quite different from what we see in movies like \"Jurassic Park.\" According to a study published in the journal Evolution, dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies like birds, might have produced closed-mouth vocalizations akin to cooing or a muffled growl, similar to the coo of a pigeon or the low rumble of an ostrich. The study, involving multiple species of archosaurs (including birds and crocodiles), reveals that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved independently in birds at least 16 times, with the ability being associated with large-bodied dinosaurs.\n\nThe sounds in \"Jurassic Park\" were creatively crafted by sound designers, using a variety of animal noises. For instance, the T. rex's roar was based on a baby elephant's cry, while the raptors' sounds featured a mix of real-life sources like tortoise mating calls and goose hisses. The team behind the film mixed these natural sounds to create fictional dinosaur vocalizations.\n\nThe research also highlights the lack of knowledge about dinosaur vocalizations due to the scarcity of fossil evidence for vocal organs. Scientists speculate that dinosaurs might have had air sacs and possibly a bird-like syrinx, enabling them to produce low-frequency sounds like the coo of a dove or the mumble of an ostrich. The study's authors argue that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalizations could have evolved independently in different dinosaur lineages.\n\nWhile the movie industry has popularized a dinosaur roar, the reality is that the exact nature of dinosaur sounds remains largely speculative. With only a fraction of dinosaur genera discovered, there's a significant gap in our understanding of their vocal capabilities. The study emphasizes the importance of studying living birds to infer possible dinosaur vocalizations, suggesting that some dinosaurs might have communicated with throat-puffed, bird-like calls, such as the low, throaty sounds of ostriches or cassowaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the research brings a new perspective on dinosaur vocalizations, challenging the iconic roars and revealing a more nuanced understanding of these ancient creatures. As our knowledge of dinosaur vocalizations evolves, it opens up intriguing possibilities for what these long-gone beasts might have sounded like, even if the definitive sounds remain shrouded in mystery.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

In a study, subjects watched YouTube videos while inside an MRI machine, and the researchers used brain patterns to create a continuous, albeit abstract, representation of the videos they were watching. This technology allows scientists to potentially \"read\" dynamic visual experiences, including dreams and thoughts, by analyzing brain activity during both visual stimulation and when the brain processes internal imagery.\n\nThe study, led by Shinji Nishimoto and Jack Gallant, demonstrates a leap in decoding internal mental processes, though it's still in its early stages.

The probability distribution is updated as new information emerges, favoring areas closer to the probable location given the suspected deliberate diversion, rather than accidents. Bayesian methods were instrumental in locating the wreckage of Air France Flight 447 in 2009, despite initial challenges due to unpredictable ocean currents and limited data.

However, experts acknowledge that the search for MH370 is complicated by the vastness of the search area and the lack of definitive clues, leading some to express skepticism about the chances of finding the plane. The hunt for debris or wreckage may provide insights into the general location but is unlikely to reveal the complete fate of the aircraft, according to statisticians.

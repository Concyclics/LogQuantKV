He questioned whether he was responsible for the deaths, especially considering its widespread use by enemies and criminals, including terrorists.\n\nBorn in 1919, Kalashnikov designed the AK-47 during World War II to address the Red Army's need for a reliable weapon. The rifle became one of the most recognizable and widely used assault rifles, with an estimated 100 million units sold globally.

As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from last year's total by that time. AFM primarily affects children, with symptoms including sudden muscle weakness, paralysis, and in some cases, respiratory issues.\n\nThe disease, which saw a surge in 2014, has puzzled health officials due to its potential link with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a virus that caused a large respiratory outbreak that year. While no definitive cause has been established, EV-D68 has not been conclusively tied to this year's surge, though some enterovirus strains have been detected. The CDC is monitoring the situation closely, urging increased reporting and cautioning that the number of cases could continue to rise.\n\nAFM typically affects children aged 7, with symptoms onset often following a fever or respiratory illness. In 2014, 120 children were diagnosed, and recovery rates were mixed, with only a minority fully recovering. Treatment options are limited to supportive care, and the condition's long-term effects remain largely unknown.\n\nParents, like Robin Roberts and Angela Andersen, have shared their harrowing experiences with their children, who lost motor functions rapidly. The condition is rare, with the CDC noting that the rise in cases may be due to increased reporting or a new strain of virus, but more research is needed to confirm causality.\n\nAs the CDC investigates, preventive measures include maintaining good hygiene, especially during the summer months when enteroviruses tend to circulate.

Researchers, including Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the University of Pavia, have performed a bloodstain pattern analysis on the fabric, using live subjects and mannequins to recreate the conditions that would have produced the stains if the shroud were authentic.\n\nTheir study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, found that the blood patterns on the shroud do not match those expected from a crucifixion scenario. The researchers observed discrepancies in the blood flow angles, with some stains suggesting a standing position, which is inconsistent with the traditional interpretation of the shroud as the cloth of a crucified man. The spear wound patterns, for instance, did not align with the expected flow from a crucifixion, and the bloodstains showed variations that could not be replicated in a realistic manner.\n\nWhile the shroud's radiocarbon dating places it between 1260 and 1390 CE, the forensic analysis questions its historical significance.

Despite the non-binding nature of the vote, the unusually high rejection rate signals a shift in shareholder sentiment, with calls for more accountability and alignment between executive pay and company performance.\n\nBob Dudley's pay package, which includes a $19.6 million total compensation, was defended by the company, citing his efforts in managing the aftermath of the Gulf of Mexico disaster and improving safety records. However, critics argue that the pay increase was excessive given the challenging year and the need for cost-cutting measures. The company's chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, acknowledged the shareholders' concerns and promised to review the pay policy in consultation with major investors.\n\nBP's dividend proposal was also affected by the downturn, with the possibility of a reduction discussed due to the impact of low oil prices. The company's performance-based targets for executive pay, which led to bonuses for Dudley and other executives, were met, but the severity of the financial situation and the resulting losses fueled the shareholder backlash.\n\nThe vote against the pay package marked a rare defeat for a top UK company, with some shareholder advisors suggesting that future executive pay decisions could face stricter scrutiny. The outcome of the vote, although non-binding, highlights the growing pressure on corporations to align executive pay with company performance and shareholder interests.", "answers": ["Oil giant BP lost $5.2 billion last year, but the company somehow saw fit to propose maximum bonuses for 2015 for its top executives, including a 20% pay increase for CEO Bob Dudley—a proposal that 59% of shareholders roundly rejected by proxy vote at Thursday's annual meeting, MarketWatch reports.

In 2015, the number of permits issued for the Northbound thru-hike reached an unprecedented level, and the 2016 quota system indicates a continued rise in popularity. The surge has raised concerns about overcrowding, environmental impact, and the potential for inexperienced hikers to put pressure on the trail infrastructure and local communities.\n\nThe hike, often seen as a transformative experience, attracts both seasoned and novice hikers. However, the increasing numbers have prompted discussions about responsible hiking practices. The Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) has implemented a permit system with a daily cap to manage the flow of hikers and minimize trail degradation. This is particularly crucial in the desert sections of the trail, where ecosystems are vulnerable.\n\nThe popularity of \"Wild\" has led to a rise in female hikers, with anecdotal evidence suggesting a shift from 10% to around 30% female hikers. The book and film showcase the challenges and rewards of the trail, including Strayed's own journey of self-discovery and healing.\n\nAs the trail's fame grows, the PCTA emphasizes the importance of preparation, Leave No Trace principles, and financial planning for the demanding hike.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The dinosaur, with rainbow-colored feathers, stands out as the first known creature with asymmetrical feathers, suggesting the potential for steering during flight. Caihong had a mix of dinosaurian and bird-like features, including a Velociraptor-like skull, bird-like feathers, and a crested head. Its feathers, particularly on the head, neck, and chest, were exquisitely preserved, revealing microscopic structures resembling iridescent melanosomes, which indicate the presence of vibrant colors, similar to those of hummingbirds. The dinosaur's feathers were not only colorful but also contributed to its probable display behaviors, possibly aiding in attracting mates or signaling. The discovery pushes the understanding of dinosaur plumage and its role in evolution, with Caihong's feathers suggesting a more colorful Jurassic world than previously thought. The presence of iridescent feathers on a dinosaur challenges the notion that dinosaurs lacked vibrant displays, and it opens up possibilities for further research on dinosaurian displays and the origins of avian traits.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax also sparked unity against it, with opponents ranging from liberals to libertarians, labor unions, and businesses. Seattle's exclusion of milk-based beverages from the tax and the potential for price hikes to disproportionately affect low-income households were major criticisms. The tax's lack of success in achieving its health goals and the migration of sales to neighboring areas without the tax underscored the challenge of implementing such policies. Similar debates played out in other cities, with Seattle's experience serving as a cautionary tale for future attempts at sugar taxes.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Rebekah's case highlights the issue of people being listed as missing due to various reasons, including temporary disappearances or personal choices, as well as the Humboldt County's high rate of missing persons reports, which is partly attributed to the transient nature of the cannabis industry and the difficulty in distinguishing between voluntary disappearances and suspicious cases.\n\nThe Humboldt County has the highest per-capita rate of missing persons in California, with a total of 35 individuals listed on the Attorney General's website. The cases range from adults who went missing for various reasons, including work-related absences, to the mysterious cases of unexplained disappearances like the 1977 disappearance of the Stuart sisters and the ongoing search for missing teenager Chris Giauque, whose body was never found.\n\nThe Eureka Police Department receives around 40 missing persons reports monthly, with many cases being resolved quickly due to missing individuals reappearing or choosing to remain uncontacted voluntarily. The local law enforcement agencies, like the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office, emphasize the importance of thorough investigations but also acknowledge the challenges posed by the transient nature of the cannabis industry workers and the possibility of false reports.\n\nPrivate investigator Todd Matthews' database, NamUs, provides a broader perspective on missing persons cases, but standardization and collaboration among local agencies are needed to improve the situation.

Researchers found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen, a commonly recommended pain reliever, were more likely to have children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related issues. The study, conducted on 64,000 Danish children, showed a correlation between acetaminophen use and a 29% increased risk of ADHD when taken chronically or for extended periods. While the researchers did not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, they suggested that women should consider avoiding long-term use or limit its intake during pregnancy.\n\nThe study authors, like Dr. Beate Ritz from UCLA, emphasize that the link may not be solely due to the drug itself, as other factors like infections or underlying genetic predispositions could be involved.

The lion's death sparked outrage, with calls for non-lethal methods in similar situations.\n\nAnother incident occurred in South Africa, where a lion named Sylvester escaped from Karoo National Park and posed a risk to humans. Although authorities initially considered relocating or tranquilizing the lion, they eventually decided to kill it after it escaped, citing potential harm to livestock and public safety.\n\nThese incidents reflect the decline in lion populations, with the African lion classified as a vulnerable species. The escapes are attributed to habitat loss due to urbanization and encroachment, as well as inadequate fencing.

Trump denied directing Michael Flynn to discuss Russia and defended him, stating Flynn's actions were within his job description. He expressed frustration with the media's portrayal of his administration, claiming it was a \"fine-tuned machine\" despite the challenges faced, including the controversy surrounding Flynn's resignation and reports of contacts between his campaign and Russian officials.\n\nDuring the conference, Trump questioned the credibility of the news reports on his administration's performance, asserting that he knows when a story is truthful or not. He defended his travel ban, saying it was \"not a good question\" and promised a revised version soon. Trump also discussed the need to address Russia without prejudicing the outcome, acknowledging that he had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin but denied any collusion.\n\nThe press conference showcased Trump's combative style, with him joking about CNN's labor secretary nominee, Alexander Acosta, and even suggesting a meeting with a reporter, April Ryan, after her question about the Congressional Black Caucus.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

At the Warratyi rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a chance discovery by archaeologist Giles Hamm and aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard revealed a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, challenging the conventional timeline of human arrival in Australia. The site holds significance due to the presence of sophisticated tools, including sophisticated stone axes, ochre use, and evidence of interactions with megafauna like the Diprotodon optatum. The find pushes the estimated arrival of humans in the region to at least 46,000 years ago, suggesting an earlier migration pattern than previously believed.\n\nThe excavation uncovered a rich cache of artifacts, including bone fragments, 4,300 objects, and a possible presence of early technological advancements. The presence of bone and eggshell fragments from the extinct Diprotodon, along with evidence of coexistence, indicates human interaction with megafauna, which has implications for understanding the relationship between humans and large animals during that era.\n\nRadiocarbon dating of eggshells and charcoal from the site indicate a timeline between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago, supporting the early occupation of the arid region. The discovery challenges the notion that humans arrived in Australia later than 50,000 years ago, potentially suggesting an earlier colonization route.\n\nThe Warratyi rock shelter, with its well-preserved evidence, contributes to a reevaluation of the innovation and adaptability of early Australians, debunking the perception of a simplistic material culture in the region. The site's findings, including the oldest known use of ochre and the development of key technologies, demonstrate a rapid cultural evolution.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the timing of human settlement in the arid interior is ongoing, with some evidence pointing to a more rapid expansion than previously thought.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through resource acquisition.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's theory proposes a three-step progression for civilizations seeking to dominate the universe. The first step involves utilizing a planet's resources (Type I), followed by harnessing energy from a star (Type II), and ultimately capturing energy from an entire galaxy (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that civilizations must actively capture energy from distant stars to prevent being isolated due to the expanding universe's dark energy. As space expands, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible, necessitating proactive measures to secure energy sources.\n\nHooper proposes that advanced civilizations, aware of their cosmic isolation, would construct massive structures like Dyson spheres – either as static shells or swarms of statites – to capture and harness energy from stars. These structures would enable civilizations to counteract the effects of dark energy and maintain access to resources. While humanity is currently in the early stages of this process, Olaf Stapledon's science fiction and physicist Freeman Dyson's theories suggest that more evolved civilizations might have already reached these milestones.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres and other advanced technologies, such as solar sails and rings of statites, are recurring themes in science fiction, reflecting humanity's fascination with the possibilities of interstellar expansion and resource acquisition. As we search for intelligent life, the hunt for signs of alien activity might include observing unusual light signatures or galaxies with missing prime stars, indicating the presence of a civilization actively harvesting energy from afar.\n\nIn summary, the news revolves around the idea that advanced civilizations face a cosmic race against time to secure energy resources as the universe expands.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

This decision was met with criticism, with some arguing that the amount of water being wasted was unnecessary, given the low likelihood of health risks from the incident. Swonger himself denied actually urinating in the reservoir, stating he only relieved himself on a nearby wall. The Water Bureau cited safety precautions as the reason for the water dump, despite tests showing no contamination.\n\nSwonger, along with two friends, received trespassing citations and could face additional charges. The incident led to a debate about the city's handling of the situation and the future of open reservoirs in Portland, which are set to phase out due to federal requirements.

Gibson CEO Henry Juszkiewicz claimed that the company had purchased wood legally, but the government maintained that emails and seized documents suggested the company was aware of the potential illegality of the supply chain.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) director, Andrea Johnson, argued that the Lacey Act required end-users like Gibson to verify the legality of their wood sourcing, and EIA's investigations indicated that Gibson knowingly imported wood linked to illegal timber harvests. Gibson denied these allegations, stating that they had followed legal procedures and stopped importing wood from Madagascar after the 2009 coup that raised concerns about the legitimacy of the Malagasy government's exports.\n\nThe situation sparked concerns among other guitar manufacturers, such as C.F.

{"pred": "Recent studies based on observations of Mars' atmosphere have revealed significant discoveries about the planet's ancient water history. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a substantial portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, which reached depths of up to a mile, persisted for millions of years, providing a warm and wet environment that could have supported the potential for life.\n\nThe water on Mars was initially abundant, with a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. The isotopic analysis, comparing the abundance of deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen) in the Martian atmosphere, indicates that the planet had lost a significant amount of water over time due to its thinning atmosphere. The water loss led to a higher concentration of deuterium, with some areas showing enrichments up to 8 times the Earth's oceanic ratio.\n\nThe presence of an extensive ocean suggests Mars was more habitable than previously thought, with the possibility of liquid water pools, rivers, and even lakes, providing conditions conducive to the evolution of life. Scientists like John Bridges and Charles Cockell emphasize the likelihood of Mars being at least temporarily habitable in the past.\n\nAs research continues, future missions like the European Space Agency's Exomars rover aim to further investigate the potential for past life on Mars, with the recent detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere raising hopes for biological activity. However, determining whether life ever existed on Mars remains an open question, with ongoing debates about the extent of water and its implications for past habitability.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, the court ruled that the shape alone does not confer sufficient distinctiveness for a trademark, requiring evidence of recognition across all EU member states, not just a significant part. This ruling annuls Nestlé's appeal and sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office for reconsideration.\n\nThe Kit Kat shape has been a point of contention for decades, with Mondelez arguing that it lacks distinctiveness across the entire EU.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic T. rex roar from popular culture, suggesting that the mighty dinosaur likely didn't sound like the menacing growl portrayed in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" Instead, scientists argue that T. rex and other dinosaurs may have communicated with sounds closer to those of birds, particularly large-bodied species like ostriches and doves, emitting low-frequency, throaty vocalizations. The study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzes the vocalizations of dinosaurs based on the assumption that birds, which are descendants of dinosaurs, share similar vocal traits.\n\nThe research team, led by University of Texas biologist Chad Eliason, analyzed the vocalizations of living and extinct animals, including birds and crocodiles, to identify a pattern of \"closed-mouth vocalizations\" characterized by throaty coos or mumbles. These sounds, unlike the iconic T. rex roar, were more likely to be produced by dinosaurs with large bodies, such as dinosaurs with air sacs similar to those of birds.\n\nThe study reveals that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved independently in different animal lineages, including birds, suggesting that dinosaurs might have had a bird-like capacity to produce sounds like coos or mumbles. While the exact dinosaur sounds remain speculative, the researchers propose that the T. rex's potential vocalizations might have resembled the quiet coo of a dove or the low rumble of an ostrich.\n\nThe film industry, however, has contributed to the myth of dinosaur roars, with the iconic T. rex sound in \"Jurassic Park\" created using a combination of animal noises, including baby elephant cries, tiger growls, and an alligator's gurgle. The raptors' hissing sound, on the other hand, was inspired by goose vocalizations.\n\nThe study highlights the limitations of reconstructing dinosaur vocalizations due to the lack of fossil evidence for vocal organs. Nonetheless, the findings provide intriguing insights into the possibility of dinosaurs communicating in ways different from popular perception, potentially with throaty, bird-like vocalizations.\n\nAs the field of paleontology continues to uncover more about dinosaur vocalizations, it becomes clear that the world of dinosaurs was far more nuanced than initially imagined, with a range of vocal behaviors that extend beyond the iconic roars we associate with them.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

Bayesian statisticians, who have a history of assisting in locating lost objects, can help refine search areas by updating probabilities based on factors like flight path, wind patterns, ocean currents, and previously searched regions. The probability of finding the plane increases or decreases depending on the likelihood of a deliberate diversion, which has shifted the focus from an accident to a potential intentional act.\n\nStatisticians, like those who helped locate Air France Flight 447 in 2009, employ Bayesian methods to create probability distributions across a search area, considering factors like the plane's last known location, wreckage detection rates, and the probability of different scenarios. However, the complex nature of the search for Flight 370, with new evidence suggesting a deliberate act, adds an extra layer of challenge. Bayesian calculations involve subjective judgments and the integration of conflicting information.\n\nWhile Bayesian techniques were instrumental in locating the Air France wreckage, experts debate their applicability in the current search.

The court heard that Mubarak and his associates, including Interior Minister Habib el-Adli, were accused of corruption and violence against Egyptians. The outcome of the elections could determine the balance of power, with the Brotherhood potentially forming a single-party government or a coalition, depending on the parliamentary composition.\n\nAs the trial continues, Egyptians are preparing for the one-year anniversary of the revolution that led to Mubarak's fall, while the military's authority remains uncertain. The new parliament's role and the formation of a new government are key concerns, with the military's commitment to democratic transition under scrutiny.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "On Wednesday evening, an unusual traffic accident occurred in Mendon, Massachusetts, when a Toyota Corolla driven by Nabila Altahan followed a GPS navigation instruction too hastily. The incident took place when Altahan, while traveling westbound on Route 4, received a sudden command to turn around due to the car having already passed its destination. Reacting swiftly, Altahan steered the car off the road, causing it to become suspended from a telephone pole's guy wire. Fortunately, both Altahan and her passenger sustained no injuries.\n\nThe driver, who was at a minature golf course, managed to exit the vehicle before it became stuck. Local authorities, including the State Police and Rutland City Fire Department, responded to the scene, dealing with the peculiar situation. The incident serves as a reminder of the potential risks when relying too heavily on GPS guidance, particularly when unexpected commands are given.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP.

AFM primarily affects children, with symptoms including sudden muscle weakness, paralysis, and in some cases, respiratory issues.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak, which saw 120 cases, was initially linked to enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), but the cause remains uncertain. While EV-D68 cases have not been as prevalent this year, there is concern that the condition could be related to other enteroviruses. The CDC is investigating and urging vigilance, with cases reported in multiple states, including California, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, and Kansas.\n\nTreatment options for AFM are limited, with physical therapy and, in some cases, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) being tried. Recovery rates for children vary, with only a minority fully recovering. The condition is particularly concerning due to its rapid progression and lack of understanding about its causes and long-term effects.\n\nParents and healthcare professionals are expressing concern, with some fearing a repeat of the 2014 surge.

Researchers, including Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the University of Pavia, employed Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to study the blood-like stains on the linen cloth. They found inconsistencies in the blood flow patterns, which do not align with the expected positions of a crucified or hanging body.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, reveals that the bloodstains on the shroud cannot be replicated by a realistic scenario, such as blood flowing from wounds at the appropriate angles for a crucifixion position. The researchers observed discrepancies like the angle of trickles on the forearm and the lack of consistency between the spear wound, hand, and back stains, which do not match the expected blood flow patterns.\n\nWhile the shroud's radiocarbon dating places it within a timeframe compatible with the life of Jesus, the forensic analysis questions its historical significance. The investigation suggests that the shroud may be a 14th-century artistic representation rather than a genuine relic. The findings have reignited the debate over the shroud's authenticity, with some experts acknowledging the scientific approach but noting that further study is needed to account for factors like body movement during preparation for burial.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin remains an intriguing enigma, with its origins and creation methods yet to be definitively explained.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Ross initially claimed to be worth $3.7 billion, more than his previously reported $2.9 billion, due to undisclosed assets in trusts. Forbes initially listed him at $2.9 billion but removed him from the 2017 Forbes 400 after discovering discrepancies in his financial-disclosure forms. Ross' assets were said to have been transferred to trusts after the election, but he denied providing documentation to support this claim.\n\nRoss' history includes a reputation for dishonesty, stretching back to at least 2004, where he inflated his assets to appear more influential. His bankruptcy expertise led to lucrative deals, such as the purchase of LTV, where he strategically avoided pension liabilities. His rise to prominence involved lying about his wealth, with Forbes reporting discrepancies in his reported net worth, which he initially denied but later acknowledged.\n\nUpon joining Trump's administration, Ross faced scrutiny for his connections to Vladimir Putin's associates and a shipping company with potential conflicts of interest. His confirmation as commerce secretary was marred by questions about undisclosed lawsuits and a lack of full disclosure. Despite Trump's defense of Ross, his past misrepresentations and extravagant lifestyle fueled by false claims about his wealth have persisted.\n\nDuring his tenure, Ross' appointment was criticized by Trump, who believed in his skills but expected him to be \"scrupulous\" about potential conflicts. The secretary's net worth, as calculated by Forbes, was based on the success of his private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., which involved questionable practices, such as underestimating environmental liabilities and potential fees. Ross' inflated net worth figures were driven by the desire to attract more investors, and he misled Forbes about the source of his wealth.\n\nRoss' admission of a $2 billion discrepancy in assets, which he claimed was transferred to trusts, led to questions about the ethics of his actions and the potential influence on his business dealings. The controversy surrounding Ross' wealth and integrity has persisted, with accusations of lying, misrepresentation, and legal issues involving his private equity firm.\n\nIn summary, Wilbur Ross' journey from a prominent bankruptcy specialist to a controversial cabinet member is marked by a pattern of dishonesty, which not only affected Forbes' perception of his wealth but also shaped his business ventures and personal relationships, including his marriage to a socialite.

However, the situation has exposed the fragility of the region, with each country's self-interests at play. The international community, recognizing the gravity of the situation, must step in to prevent a total collapse of Mali.\n\nThe crisis has also raised concerns over the impact on the UNESCO-listed city of Timbuktu, with the possibility of damage to its cultural heritage during the conflict. The fighting has led to the imposition of Islamic law by some rebel factions, including Ansar Dine, which links to al-Qaeda. UNESCO has urged protection of Timbuktu's historical sites, including its mosques and ancient manuscripts.\n\nThe economic consequences are severe, with fuel shortages looming as the country relies on imports from neighboring nations. The sanctions imposed by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have cut off Mali's access to essential resources, causing long queues at gas stations and uncertainty over the government's ability to pay civil servants.\n\nDespite the junta's claims of a coup for national interest, the rebels have made gains, raising tensions. Negotiations with the rebel group, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, have not yet materialized, with the rebels insisting on dialogue with a recognized authority.\n\nIn summary, the crisis in Mali threatens not only the country's territorial integrity but also regional stability, with potential spill-over effects on neighboring nations and the broader Sahel region. International support is crucial to prevent a complete collapse and protect the cultural heritage of Timbuktu while addressing the ongoing security challenges.", "answers": ["Since we last checked in, the situation in Mali following a soldiers' coup has spiraled, with rising concerns over food and gas shortages, violence, and indeed the country's \"very existence,\" according to Le Monde.

The dinosaur had a mix of dinosaurian and bird-like features, such as a Velociraptor-like skull, but also displayed iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, reminiscent of hummingbird feathers. The presence of melanosomes in the fossilized feathers indicates the dinosaur's feathers may have shimmered like a rainbow, adding a vibrant touch to the \"Jurassic World\" picture.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax did not apply to milk-based beverages, prompting Starbucks to refuse the tax. Seattle's tax also faced legal challenges and a potential loss of revenue as people voted with their wallets, choosing to shop outside the city.\n\nThe tax's failure in Seattle mirrors the experience of Cook County, Illinois, which repealed its soda tax within two months due to public outrage. Critics argue that soda taxes don't address health concerns effectively and instead create a regressive system that hurts low-income households and drives businesses away.\n\nSeattle's tax has prompted calls for consistency in applying the tax to all sugary beverages and questioning the fairness of targeting specific products. The tax's purpose to improve public health through behavior modification has been questioned, as people respond to price hikes by seeking alternatives outside the city.\n\nThe Seattle tax serves as a cautionary tale for other cities, highlighting the importance of considering the potential backlash and unintended consequences when implementing such policies.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

At the Warratyi rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a chance discovery by archaeologist Giles Hamm and aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard revealed a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, challenging the conventional timeline of human arrival in Australia. The site showcased sophisticated tools, including sophisticated stone axes, ochre use, and evidence of interaction with megafauna like the Diprotodon optatum, suggesting a presence much earlier than previously believed.\n\nThe excavation uncovered 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, with the age of the site determined to be between 49,000 and 46,000 years old. This pushes the arrival of humans in the arid regions to around 10,000 years earlier than previously thought. The presence of megafauna remains indicates possible hunting and coexistence, which raises questions about the role of humans in the extinction of these large animals.\n\nThe study, published in Nature, integrates various dating methods, including optical dating of quartz grains and radiocarbon dating of eggshells and charcoal, to establish a comprehensive chronology. The findings suggest that humans rapidly expanded into the arid interior, challenging the notion of a delayed colonization. The site, Warratyi, showcases the early development of key technologies and cultural practices, debunking the perception of a simplistic and backward material culture in Australia.\n\nWhile the discovery is significant, it is not without controversy, with some dating estimates differing slightly from other findings. However, the consensus is that this discovery significantly extends our understanding of Australia's prehistory and the adaptability of its inhabitants.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

Notable performances include Will Poulter as a conflicted cop, and John Boyega as a security guard caught in the crossfire.\n\n\"Detroit\" starts with a historical overview of the black migration to urban areas, setting the stage for the Algiers Motel incident.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through resource acquisition and energy harvesting.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's theory proposes a three-step progression for civilizations seeking to dominate the universe. The first step involves utilizing a planet's resources (Type I), followed by harnessing a star's energy (Type II), and eventually capturing energy from an entire galaxy (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that civilizations must actively capture energy from distant stars to prevent being isolated due to the expanding universe's dark energy. As space expands, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible, necessitating proactive measures to secure energy sources.\n\nHooper argues that advanced civilizations would prioritize capturing stars for their energy, potentially using Dyson spheres, which are theoretical constructs of solar-powered satellites forming a shell around a star to extract its energy. This technology, first envisioned by science fiction writers like Olaf Stapledon and later discussed by physicists like Freeman Dyson, could serve as a signature of an alien presence, with their waste heat detectable as infrared radiation.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures, such as statites (hovering satellites), is often explored in science fiction, like Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\" and Larry Niven's \"Ringworld.\" As civilizations progress, they would seek to reach Type III status, which requires capturing energy from entire galaxies.\n\nWhile humans are currently at a relatively early stage, the possibility of alien civilizations millions of years ahead suggests that they might have already begun the process of expanding and securing energy sources. The search for these advanced civilizations could involve observing unusual light signatures, such as galaxies with missing prime stars or those exhibiting signs of star manipulation.\n\nIn summary, the news revolves around the idea that advanced civilizations face a cosmic race against time to secure energy from distant stars before the expanding universe isolates them. Key concepts include Kardashev's three types of civilizations, Dyson spheres, and the potential for detecting alien activity through unusual energy signatures.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "A series of recent discoveries in肯尼亚的Olorgesailie Basin challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors. Researchers, publishing in Science, report on three key findings:\n\n1. Middle Stone Age advancements: Fossil evidence and newly excavated tools, dating back to around 320,000 years ago, suggest dramatic shifts in tool-making and possibly trading networks due to climate fluctuations. The use of obsidian, transported from afar, indicates long-distance interactions among Homo sapiens or their relatives.\n\n2. Technological innovations: The Olorgesailie tools, with their smaller, specialized designs, represent a transition from earlier, simpler tools. This shift is seen as a response to the unpredictable food sources caused by climate changes, requiring increased mobility and resourcefulness.\n\n3. Climate-driven adaptation: The researchers argue that the changing environment, marked by periodic droughts and wet cycles, forced early humans to develop strategies for survival, such as tool-making and trade, that foreshadowed the rise of Homo sapiens.\n\n4. Earlier-than-expected milestones: The discoveries push back the timeline for key innovations, challenging the traditional view of a \"human revolution\" around 40,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence points to a gradual process of cultural and technological advancement over millions of years.\n\n5. Complex behaviors and social networks: The Olorgesailie findings suggest that the development of complex behaviors, including long-distance trade, may have been driven by environmental pressures, potentially setting the stage for the emergence of modern human traits. However, the exact connection to Homo sapiens and its evolution remains a topic of ongoing research.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Previously, Kieran had partial hearing due to a hearing aid, but the surgery, while initially cosmetic, significantly enhanced his quality of life.

Gibson CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, maintained that the company had purchased the wood legally, but the government claimed that emails and seized documents suggested the company was aware of the ban and took steps to maintain a supply chain potentially tied to illegal timber harvests.\n\nEnvironmental Investigation Agency (EIA) Director Andrea Johnson confirmed that the Lacey Act requires end-users to verify the legality of their wood supply chain, and EIA had investigated Gibson, stating that the company knowingly imported legally questionable wood. Gibson denied the allegations and argued that they had followed legal procedures, with a company attorney asserting that they had presented documents supporting their compliance with regulations.\n\nThe situation raised concerns among other guitar manufacturers, such as C.F.

{"pred": "Recent studies based on extensive observations of Mars have revealed significant discoveries about the planet's ancient water history. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a substantial portion of the Martian northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, which reached depths of up to a mile, persisted for millions of years, providing a potentially habitable environment for life.\n\nThe water on Mars, initially abundant, had a lower proportion of ordinary hydrogen due to the planet's thinner atmosphere, causing a higher concentration of deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen). Researchers, using infrared telescopes, mapped the atmospheric water and its deuterium content, indicating extensive water loss over time. The maps show a global water layer that could have been up to 137 meters deep, with variations depending on elevation, with some areas having higher deuterium enrichment and others lower.\n\nThis discovery challenges previous assumptions about Mars' water presence, suggesting a more consistent and prolonged presence of liquid water compared to earlier beliefs. Mars' ancient climate supported the formation of rivers, deltas, and possibly even seas, making it a more favorable environment for life. However, while the evidence points to a wetter past, the exact extent of habitability and the possibility of past life remain open questions.\n\nAs research continues, future missions like the European Space Agency's Exomars rover will further investigate the potential for past life on Mars, with the recent detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere raising interest in biological activity. Despite the lack of definitive evidence, the accumulating evidence suggests that Mars was once a more habitable world than previously thought.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "In a recent legal development, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) dismissed appeals by both Nestlé and Mondelez, overturning a trademark for the shape of the Kit Kat four-fingered chocolate bar. Nestlé, which had been seeking to protect the distinctive shape for over a decade, had initially won a trademark in 2012, but the court ruled that Nestlé failed to provide sufficient evidence that the shape was universally recognized as distinctive across all EU countries. The decision nullifies the Kit Kat's protected shape, potentially opening up the market for competitors like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj and allowing for generic four-fingered snacks in supermarkets.\n\nThe case highlighted the complexity of trademark laws, with the ECJ emphasizing that a product's shape must be distinctive in every EU market for it to be eligible for trademark protection. The ruling affects not only Kit Kat but also other four-fingered treats like Mondelez's Leo bar and Lindt's gold-wrapped Easter bunnies, which faced similar legal battles.\n\nWhile Nestlé expressed its intention to continue the fight, the outcome suggests that the company must present stronger evidence of distinctiveness in each EU country for the shape to be re-registered. This ruling has broader implications for trademark owners, particularly in the context of Brexit, as it underscores the need for clear evidence of recognition across the entire EU market, not just a significant part of it. The case involving the shape of the Kit Kat bar has been a long-standing legal saga with echoes in other disputes, such as Cadbury's attempt to trademark the purple color for its Dairy Milk bars.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic roar of the T. rex, suggesting that dinosaurs, including the mighty predator, likely made sounds quite different from what we see in movies like \"Jurassic Park.\" According to a study published in the journal Evolution, dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies like birds, might have produced closed-mouth vocalizations akin to cooing or a muffled growl, similar to the coo of a pigeon or the low rumble of an ostrich. The study, involving multiple universities, analyzed the vocalizations of living and extinct animals, revealing that closed-mouth sounds evolved independently in birds and crocodiles, hinting at a possible dinosaur adaptation.\n\nThe sounds in \"Jurassic Park\" were created using a variety of animal noises, such as baby elephants, baby elephants' roars, and even a goose's hiss. The film's creators mixed these sounds to create the iconic T. rex roar, which was a cinematic invention rather than a faithful representation of dinosaur vocalizations. The study also suggests that the T. rex's sound might have resembled the cooing of a bird, with throaty, low-frequency vocalizations.\n\nThe research team, led by University of Texas biologist Chad Eliason, focused on \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" which are common in birds with large bodies, like doves and ostriches. These sounds are generated through an esophageal pouch, a feature shared by some dinosaurs. The study found that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved at least 16 times in birds, indicating that it could have emerged independently in different dinosaur lineages.\n\nWhile the exact dinosaur sounds remain largely speculative due to lack of fossil evidence, the study provides insights into the possibility of dinosaurs emitting quiet, throaty vocalizations, possibly resembling the coo of a bird. The findings challenge the popular perception of dinosaurs as loud-roaring beasts and open up a new understanding of their potential vocal repertoire.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

{"pred": "Researchers at UC Berkeley have made a significant breakthrough in understanding human cognition by developing a method to reconstruct videos from subjects' brain activity. In a study, scientists monitored brain patterns of volunteers as they watched YouTube videos, using MRI machines to track blood flow in the visual cortex. By analyzing neural activity, a computer algorithm learned to correlate specific patterns with visual information, creating a continuous, albeit abstract, representation of the videos subjects were watching. This achievement marks a first in decoding dynamic visual experiences, potentially paving the way for understanding dreams, thoughts, and internal mental processes.\n\nThe technology, although currently limited to static reconstructions, could eventually offer insights into the brain's processing of dreams and non-visual experiences. However, it's important to note that the current method is far from reading minds, as it relies on extensive brain activity during visual stimulation. Future research aims to improve the resolution by examining more complex visual areas and additional brain modules, with the ultimate goal of enhancing our understanding of the brain's naturalistic visual processing.\n\nThe study's implications extend beyond scientific curiosity, touching upon potential applications in fields like medicine, where brain activity could potentially aid paralyzed individuals in controlling external devices through imagined visual experiences. While the technology may not yet be applicable for criminal investigations, it opens up intriguing possibilities for understanding and interpreting the inner workings of the human mind.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

{"pred": "The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has sparked renewed interest in Bayesian statistics to aid in the search for the missing aircraft. Bayesian statisticians, who have a history of assisting in locating lost objects, can help refine search efforts by calculating probabilities based on factors like flight path, wind patterns, and previously searched areas. The probability distribution is updated as new information emerges, favoring areas closer to the probable location after considering deliberate diversion or other explanations.\n\nIn the case of Flight 447, Bayesian analysis played a crucial role in narrowing down the search after initial failures. The searchers initially assumed a uniform probability distribution, but subsequent updates, such as the probability of the plane being intact and the probability of signals being detected, led to the eventual discovery of the wreckage. However, challenges include incomplete search records and the need to quantify subjective judgments.\n\nWhile Bayesian techniques were instrumental in locating the Air France Flight 447 wreckage, experts debate their applicability in the ongoing search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Some argue that the complexities of the case, with new evidence suggesting a deliberate act, make Bayesian methods less suitable due to the rapid change in the situation. Others, like Tony O'Hagan, believe Bayesian techniques are adaptable to changing circumstances, allowing searchers to update probabilities as new information comes to light.\n\nDespite the potential benefits, critics caution that the use of Bayesian statistics without proper understanding can lead to flawed conclusions. The search for Flight 370 remains ongoing, with experts like Metron's Colleen Keller suggesting that the hunt should involve combining all available data, accounting for unsuccessful searches and incorporating new information as it arises.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The Virtual Telescope Project, led by astrophysicist Gianluca Masi, is partnering with several astrophotographers, including Dean Hooper, John Stevenson, Chris Stockdale, John W. Johnson, Andrew Wall, Ron Delvaux, and others, to capture and showcase the eclipse from various locations worldwide.\n\nThe event starts at 11:30 UT on January 31, with the total eclipse visible from Australia, western USA, and parts of Asia.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA.

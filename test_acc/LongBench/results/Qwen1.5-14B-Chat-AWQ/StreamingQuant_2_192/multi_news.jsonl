A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine revealed that MRSA becomes more virulent and difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. The smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, thereby enhancing its survival and invasiveness.\n\nIn a previous study, e-cigarette vapor was also found to affect MRSA resistance, but cigarette smoke had a significantly stronger impact, increasing resistance by a factor of 10 compared to non-exposed bacteria. The altered MRSA cells remained more resistant for up to 24 hours after exposure, suggesting a lasting effect. The research not only impacts smokers, who are at higher risk of contracting infections due to compromised immune systems, but also highlights the dual role of smoke – harming humans and assisting bacteria.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist, investigated MRSA's response to cigarette smoke as an alternative explanation for how smoking contributes to disease. It showed that MRSA exposed to smoke was more resistant to host immune defenses and more capable of causing pneumonia in mice. The findings emphasize the need for public health measures to discourage smoking, as it not only affects the smoker's health but also aids in the persistence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nThis research adds to the growing body of evidence linking environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke, to bacterial resistance and the severity of infections.

However, no definitive cause has been established, and the condition remains rare, with recovery rates varying from partial to full recovery.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak saw 121 cases, and while the number of cases has increased, experts caution that more information is needed to determine if this is a sustained surge or a recurrence of the 2014 pattern. Treatment options currently involve supportive care and physical therapy, with no proven cure. The condition is particularly concerning due to its unpredictable nature and the potential long-term effects on affected individuals.\n\nParents and healthcare providers are being urged to remain vigilant, practice good hygiene, and report suspected cases to the CDC for surveillance.

However, the growing number of inexperienced and unprepared individuals raises concerns about overcrowding, environmental impact, and safety. The Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) introduced a permit system in 2015 to manage the increasing numbers, limiting daily permits to 50 per day in the high season, aiming to preserve the trail and minimize strain on resources.\n\nThe hike is not without its challenges, with hikers facing physical demands, logistical issues, and the need for proper preparation.

This dinosaur, with feathers resembling those of hummingbirds, had rainbow-colored plumage, making it the first known dinosaur with iridescent feathers. The exquisitely preserved fossil revealed a mix of dark feathers and iridescent ones, particularly on the head, neck, and chest, suggesting a more colorful world than previously thought.\n\nCaihong had a theropod-like body, with Velociraptor-like features, but it possessed bird-like characteristics, including a crested head, short wings, and asymmetrical feathers that indicate the possible origin of flight in birds. Its dinosaurian traits included a two-legged stance, a crested head, and a short tail with feathered tail vertebrae, resembling the frond-shaped tail feathers seen in early birds.\n\nThe dinosaur's feathers, analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, showed melanosomes, supporting the conclusion that the feathers were iridescent. The presence of these structures suggests that Caihong's feathers displayed vivid colors, possibly shifting hues like a rainbow. The dinosaur's plumage might have played a role in attracting mates or signaling during courtship displays.\n\nWhile Caihong had some bird-like features, it was not entirely capable of flight, as its dinosaurian body and short tail indicated. The discovery pushes the understanding of dinosaurian evolution, revealing a more colorful and diverse array of feathered dinosaurs than previously known.\n\nThis remarkable find challenges researchers to reconsider the role of feathers in dinosaur biology and the potential for colorful displays in their lives. The study underscores the importance of Caihong in understanding the evolution of feather diversity and the origins of avian traits, such as iridescence, which could have played a role in prehistoric social interactions.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Rebekah's case highlights the issue of missing persons in Humboldt County, which has the highest per-capita rate of missing persons in California, as reported by the Attorney General's office.\n\nThe county's high rate of missing persons is not due to a surge in cold cases or serial killings, as previously speculated. Instead, it is attributed to factors such as the lenient reporting policy, a large transient population, and the high number of missing children, particularly those in foster care, due to the area's reputation as a destination for the cannabis industry. Many cases are resolved quickly, with runaways and temporary disappearances accounting for a significant portion of the reports.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office receives numerous reports, with some resulting from misunderstandings or voluntary disappearances. The department is working on cases involving missing adults, often focusing on cases where family members have not heard from loved ones for extended periods, especially in the cannabis industry. The Humboldt 35, a list of 35 people reported missing on the Attorney General's website, includes cases that date back decades, with some unresolved cases like the murder of a young woman and the disappearance of a 15-year-old boy.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office encourages family members to stay in contact and cooperate, as many cases are resolved when additional information is provided. The situation is further complicated by the lack of standardization in reporting across jurisdictions, leading to discrepancies in databases like NamUs and the Attorney General's list.\n\nIn conclusion, while Humboldt County's high missing persons rate is partly due to the transient nature of the cannabis industry, ongoing investigations and collaboration with families are crucial in resolving cases and providing closure for those affected.", "answers": ["It turns out missing people are pretty easy to find when they appear every week in your living room.

Researchers found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen, a commonly recommended pain reliever, had a higher likelihood of their children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related issues. The study, conducted on 64,000 Danish children, observed a correlation between acetaminophen use and a 29% increased risk of ADHD when taken chronically or for extended periods. While the study does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, it suggests that pregnant women may want to reconsider long-term use of acetaminophen, especially for managing minor aches and pains.\n\nExperts advise against drawing definitive conclusions without further research, as the study's findings need to be confirmed by additional prospective studies. Some suspect that acetaminophen's potential impact on fetal development might be due to hormonal effects or interactions with unidentified infections. Other factors, like genetics and prenatal conditions, also play a role in ADHD development.\n\nThe study authors emphasize the importance of weighing risks during pregnancy, as with antibiotics, but suggest that pregnant women should consider alternative methods for pain relief, such as non-pharmacological treatments.

In the past, Brown played a significant role in the demotion of Pluto from planetary status due to his discovery of Eris, a dwarf planet more massive than Pluto. Now, he and his colleague Konstantin Batygin have presented compelling evidence for a ninth planet, which they call \"Planet Nine\" or \"Planet X,\" based on the gravitational influence it exerts on distant dwarf planets and other small objects in the solar system.\n\nThis unseen planet, estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth, is believed to orbit at the edge of the solar system, causing subtle changes in the orbits of known objects without being directly observed. Its existence would reshape our understanding of the solar system's formation and dynamics, potentially filling the gap left by Pluto's demotion. While Brown initially aimed to disprove the existence of a ninth planet, their research led to a \"treasure map\" outlining the planet's potential orbit, encouraging others to join the search.\n\nBrown, known colloquially as the \"Pluto Killer,\" is excited about the discovery, as it would not only validate their previous work but also potentially restore Pluto's standing as a planet, according to some.

He defended himself against claims of colluding with Russia, stating that he had no knowledge of such contacts and that the leaks were likely from the previous administration. Trump also defended his travel ban, denied any connection to Russia, and expressed frustration with the slow pace of policy implementation, including the stalled Obamacare repeal and cabinet confirmation process.\n\nDuring the conference, Trump discussed the economy, saying he inherited a \"mess\" but that his administration was making progress.

The University of Michigan-led study, based on data from 1998 to 2011, found that younger patients were more likely to have advanced malignancies, requiring aggressive treatment. They were diagnosed with more distant and metastatic tumors, and had higher survival rates despite the severity of their disease.\n\nYounger patients were more inclined to receive surgery and radiation therapy compared to older counterparts. The study highlights the need for earlier screening and risk assessment, as nearly 15% of colorectal cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in people under 50 by 2030. This shift challenges current guidelines, which typically recommend screening at age 50.\n\nThe findings stress the importance of recognizing symptoms like anemia, unusual bowel movements, and dark stool, which may indicate colorectal cancer in younger individuals.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

At the Warratyi rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a chance discovery by archaeologist Giles Hamm and aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard revealed a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, challenging the conventional wisdom about the timing of human arrival in Australia. The site holds significance due to the presence of sophisticated tools, including sophisticated stone axes, ochre use, and evidence of interactions with megafauna like the Diprotodon optatum. The find pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the arid region by around 10,000 years, suggesting a rapid expansion of habitation from the coastal areas.\n\nQuartz dating and radiocarbon analysis on eggshells and charcoal indicate a sequence of occupation between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago, with some units exhibiting distinct archaeological phases. The site also marks the earliest known use of ochre and the presence of bone and stone technologies, such as hafted axes, dating back to around 38,000 years ago. The discovery supports the theory that humans, not climate change, played a role in the extinction of megafauna, as evidenced by the coexistence of human remains and megafauna remains at the Warrayti site.\n\nThe Warratyi rock shelter, located in the Flinders Ranges, is a pivotal find that redefines our understanding of the early human presence in the arid interior and showcases the advanced technological capabilities of the first Australians.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through resource acquisition and energy harvesting.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's theory proposes a three-step progression for civilizations seeking to dominate the universe. The first step involves utilizing a planet's resources (Type I), followed by harnessing a star's energy (Type II), and ultimately capturing energy from an entire galaxy (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that civilizations must actively capture energy from distant stars to prevent being isolated due to the expanding universe's dark energy. As space expands, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible, necessitating proactive measures to secure energy sources.\n\nHooper argues that advanced civilizations, aware of their cosmic fate, would strive to construct massive structures like Dyson spheres – either as static shells or swarms of statites – to capture and utilize energy from stars. These structures, like those envisioned by science fiction writers like Olaf Stapledon and Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\" or Olaf Stapledon's \"Ringworld,\" could indicate the presence of ancient, highly advanced civilizations.\n\nFreeman Dyson's concept of a Dyson sphere, a collection of satellites collecting starlight, remains a popular idea for energy extraction. While Earth is currently at a Type I stage, Dyson spheres could represent a future goal for civilizations like those described by Kardashev's hierarchy. The search for such structures could reveal signs of technological advancement, such as unusual light signatures or galaxies with missing prime stars.\n\nIn summary, the news revolves around the pursuit of galactic dominance by civilizations, driven by the need for energy and the looming threat of cosmic isolation due to dark energy.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The early years were marked by clashes, particularly a \"fuck-you meeting\" where Stewart clashed with the writers, pushing for a more aggressive and intentional style. Key hires like Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert, who brought a unique blend of humor and commentary, contributed to the show's growth.

Researchers, publishing in Science, report on significant advancements in toolmaking and potential trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives around 320,000 years ago, during the Middle Stone Age. The shifts in East African climate, marked by alternating wet and dry periods, are believed to have driven behavioral changes, including the development of smaller, specialized tools and increased mobility.\n\nThe excavated tools, some of which are the oldest of their kind, suggest a transition from larger, simpler tools like hand axes and oval hand axes to the more precise Middle Stone Age tools, possibly indicating the need for long-distance foraging and trading. Obsidian tools, typically associated with trade, were sourced from afar, suggesting connections between different hominin populations. The presence of red pigment and evidence of pigment use may indicate symbolic communication and social organization.\n\nWhile it's unclear if these developments were solely driven by Homo sapiens, the timing aligns with their emergence. Climate fluctuations, particularly during the Middle Stone Age, are seen as a key factor in shaping human adaptation and innovation. However, other factors like population dynamics or environmental pressures might also have contributed to tool innovations.\n\nThe Olorgesailie findings push back the timeline for these advancements, potentially placing them much earlier than previously thought.

Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, maintained that the company had purchased the wood legally, but the government claimed that emails and seized documents suggested the company was aware of the potential illegality of the supply chain.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) director, Andrea Johnson, stated that the Lacey Act requires end-users to verify the legality of their wood sources, but Gibson was accused of possibly sourcing from Madagascar despite the export ban on certain woods. Gibson denied the allegations, stating that they had stopped importing wood from Madagascar after the coup that led to concerns about the legitimacy of the government.\n\nThe situation raised concerns among other guitar manufacturers, such as C.F. Martin & Co., who faced potential retroactivity issues due to the Lacey Act's application to vintage instruments and木材 imports. Some, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, criticized the law for its potential to affect long-held collections and the burden it placed on businesses to prove the legality of past acquisitions.\n\nGeorge Gruhn, a prominent guitar dealer, expressed the challenges the new regulations posed for the industry, with the potential for unintended consequences and difficulties in tracing the origin of older instruments. The case against Gibson remained unresolved, with the company seeking a clear understanding of the legal requirements and a fair opportunity to present their defense.\n\nThe government's enforcement of the Lacey Act, while aimed at reducing illegal logging, had unintended consequences for the guitar industry, highlighting the need for clearer guidelines and a balance between combating illegal practices and avoiding hindering legitimate businesses.

{"pred": "Recent studies based on observations of Mars' atmosphere have revealed significant discoveries about the planet's ancient water history. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a substantial portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, which reached depths of up to a mile, persisted for millions of years, providing a warm and wet environment that could have supported the potential for life.\n\nThe water on Mars was initially abundant, with a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. The maps of atmospheric water and its deuterium content show a high D/H enrichment, indicating extensive water loss. The enrichment is particularly evident in the polar regions, with some areas having a D/H ratio up to 8 times that of Earth's ocean (VSMOW), suggesting a substantial amount of water loss over time.\n\nAs Mars' atmosphere thinned, the ocean gradually receded, losing most of its water to space. Mars' current ice caps hold only a fraction of the water that was present billions of years ago. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the sporadic presence of water on Mars, suggesting a more prolonged and widespread wet environment.\n\nScientists, including those from NASA and the European Southern Observatory, have used infrared mapping to trace the planet's water history, revealing a complex and dynamic past. Mars' ancient ocean indicates a more habitable climate, raising hopes for the possibility of life existing on the planet. However, determining whether life ever arose on Mars remains speculative, with ongoing research and future missions, such as the Exomars rover, set to explore this intriguing question further.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "In a recent legal development, the European Court of Justice has dismissed appeals by both Nestlé and Mondelez, the makers of Kit Kat and Cadbury, respectively, regarding the shape of the iconic four-fingered chocolate bar. Nestlé had been attempting to maintain a trademark on the shape of its Kit Kat since 2002, arguing that it was distinctive enough to be protected. However, the court ruled that the shape alone does not confer sufficient distinctiveness to warrant trademark protection, requiring evidence of recognition across all EU member states, not just a significant part. This decision annuls the previous trademark granted to Nestlé and sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office for reconsideration.\n\nThe ruling affects not only Kit Kat but also other similar products like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which has a similar four-fingered design. The case highlights the challenge for companies to prove that a product's shape is distinctive enough to be trademarked, with the court emphasizing that it must be recognizable in every EU market.\n\nIn addition to the Kit Kat shape, the ruling has broader implications for trademark law, particularly for companies operating within the EU single market. It underscores the need for strong evidence of distinctiveness across all member states for a trademark to be upheld. The case has been closely watched by trademark lawyers due to its potential impact on how shapes of products are legally protected.\n\nThe Kit Kat trademark battle has also touched on Brexit discussions, with some arguing that EU courts might not always favor British brands, as seen in the case of the purple color associated with Cadbury's Dairy Milk bars.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic roar of the T. rex, suggesting that dinosaurs, including the mighty predator, likely made sounds quite different from what we see in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" According to a study published in the journal Evolution, dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies like birds, might have communicated with closed-mouth vocalizations akin to cooing or a muffled roar, unlike the high-pitched roars associated with mammals. The study, involving multiple species of birds and crocodiles, reveals that closed-mouth sounds, which are prevalent in birds like doves and ostriches, evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, including dinosaurs.\n\nThe researchers, led by University of Texas biologist Chad Eliason, analyzed the vocalizations of living and extinct animals, finding a connection between large body size and the ability to produce these low-frequency sounds. The study also points out that the iconic T. rex roar, heard in movies, was a cinematic invention, combining elements from various animals such as baby elephants, alligators, and even a goose.\n\nWhile the film industry often draws upon dinosaur sounds from living relatives, the research suggests that actual dinosaur vocalizations might have resembled the cooing of pigeons or the mumbles of ostriches. The study highlights the importance of understanding the physics of sound production, as dinosaurs' vocal organs, though soft-tissue, might have allowed for similar behaviors as seen in birds, like inflating air sacs to produce low-frequency vocalizations.\n\nThe findings challenge the popular perception of dinosaurs as loud and aggressive, opening up the possibility of a more nuanced understanding of prehistoric communication. With dinosaurs' vocal abilities still largely a mystery, this research contributes to the ongoing debate about dinosaur vocalizations, emphasizing the need for further exploration based on both fossil evidence and comparative biology.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

Theories about the cause of the disappearance, with a growing likelihood of a deliberate act, influence the search strategy. Bayesian methods involve calculating probabilities for each location, considering initial estimates, new information, and overlapping probabilities. While these statistical techniques were instrumental in locating the wreckage of Air France Flight 447 in 2011, experts acknowledge that the search for MH370 presents unique challenges due to the vastness of the search area and the complexity of the new information.\n\nThe search for MH370 has faced issues with incomplete records of previous searches, requiring statisticians to make judgments and quantify subjective information. Bayesian calculations involve estimating the probability of the plane being in a specific location, adjusting for factors like the probability of a deliberate act or the probability of the plane being intact. However, critics argue that Bayesian methods may not be suitable when new evidence significantly alters the situation, as in the case of MH370, where the search area could be vast and the causes of the disappearance uncertain.\n\nWhile Bayesian statistics have been used in past air crash investigations, not all airlines or governments, including Malaysia Airlines and the Malaysian government, have employed these techniques in the current search.

The court heard a call for a harsh penalty, with the prosecution arguing that Mubarak's actions led to the deaths of protesters during the 2011 uprising.\n\nThe trial's outcome and the new parliament's composition will shape Egypt's political landscape, with the possibility of an Islamist-dominated government or a coalition that includes both Islamists and liberals. The military's role in governance remains uncertain, with the military council seeking to maintain control despite the growing demands for civilian leadership.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "On Wednesday evening, an unusual incident occurred in Mendon when a Toyota Corolla driven by Nabila Altahan became suspended from a telephone pole after an unexpected GPS navigation command. The driver, following her GPS directions too hastily, took a sharp turn while on Route 4, causing her vehicle to leave the road and become entangled in a nearby wire support. Both Altahan and her passenger were unhurt in the accident. The GPS directed her to turn around because the car had already passed its destination, as indicated by a nearby mini-golf course. The driver, who was quick to react, jumped out of the car upon realizing the situation. Responding authorities included the State Police, Rutland City Fire Department, and witnesses who observed the bizarre scene.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP. Police say 30-year-old Nabila Altahan of Dorchester, Mass., was headed west on US Route 4 when she passed her intended destination and reacted quickly to the instructions, leaving the road at a significant enough speed to propel the vehicle up the wires.

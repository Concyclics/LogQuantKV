{"pred": "Recent research has shed light on the detrimental impact of cigarette smoke on bacterial resistance, particularly in the context of the superbug Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) has revealed that MRSA becomes more virulent and difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. The smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are crucial components of the immune system's defense mechanism.\n\nIn the first study, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract showed a fourfold increase in resistance to macrophage killing and exhibited enhanced adherence to human cells, facilitating invasion. A similar finding was observed with e-cigarette vapor, although the resistance was less pronounced compared to cigarette smoke. The resistance persisted for up to 24 hours after exposure, highlighting the potential long-term impact.\n\nThe research not only affects smokers but also poses a concern for public health, as it suggests that MRSA can become more aggressive and deadly for those around smokers. The study also examined the effects on MSSA, another strain of Staphylococcus aureus, with similar results, indicating that the phenomenon is not limited to a specific bacterium.\n\nThis discovery adds to the understanding that cigarette smoke serves as an \"alarm\" to MRSA, prompting it to adapt and resist the body's defenses. The findings have implications for both smokers, who face increased risks of infections due to compromised immune systems, and the general population, as the bacteria's enhanced resistance could contribute to the spread of antibiotic-resistant infections.\n\nIn conclusion, the studies emphasize the dual threat posed by cigarette smoke – harming smokers while inadvertently aiding the growth of superbugs like MRSA.

As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from last year's total by that time. AFM primarily affects children, with symptoms including sudden muscle weakness, paralysis, and in some cases, temporary or partial recovery. The disease has been linked to enteroviruses, particularly EV-D68, although no definitive cause has been established.\n\nIn 2014, a surge in AFM cases coincided with an EV-D68 outbreak, leading to speculation that the virus might be a factor. However, this year, while no widespread EV-D68 respiratory infections have been reported, the condition's rise is concerning health officials.

The organization aims to eradicate the practice of institutional care by 2050, citing successful examples in countries like Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria.\n\nLumos argues that children's well-being is severely compromised in institutions, leading to long-lasting harm, including developmental delays, abuse, and stunted growth.

By promoting the importance of keeping children with their families and investing in their communities, Lumos believes that ending institutionalization is both morally right and economically beneficial, as it fosters healthier outcomes and reduces long-term dependency.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

{"pred": "In 2018, Seattle implemented a 1.75 cents per ounce tax on sweetened beverages, aiming to reduce sugar consumption, fund community projects, and support healthy food access. However, the tax faced significant backlash due to its regressive nature, as it led to price hikes, revenue loss, and migration of customers to neighboring areas where the tax was not in effect. Seattle's mayor, Ed Murray, had initially promoted the tax as a progressive measure, but its unintended consequences showed that it didn't achieve its goals and united diverse groups against it.\n\nCostco, a major retailer, felt the impact of the tax, with prices doubling for items like Gatorade. The tax exempted beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, causing Starbucks to refuse the tax. Seattle's tax also prompted a public outcry, with opponents including businesses, labor unions, and libertarians. The tax's lack of success in Seattle mirrors that of Cook County, Illinois, which repealed its soda tax within months.\n\nSeattle's tax, which nearly doubled the price of beverages, prompted retailers like Costco to inform customers about alternatives outside the city. The tax's impact on low-income households and the potential for revenue loss due to cross-border shopping demonstrated its regressive nature. The tax's opponents argue that it doesn't address health concerns effectively and instead creates economic challenges for both retailers and consumers.\n\nSimilar debates have played out in other cities with soda taxes, like Philadelphia and Chicago, with mixed results. Critics pointed out the need for consistency in applying the tax and questioned the fairness of targeting specific beverages.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

{"pred": "A recent analysis has revealed a concerning trend in colorectal cancer, with one in seven cases diagnosed in patients under the age of 50, contrary to traditional assumptions. This shift, as seen in a study by the University of Michigan, challenges current guidelines recommending screenings at age 50. The study, which analyzed data from 1998 to 2011, found that younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, but they also had slightly better survival rates due to more aggressive treatment.\n\nYounger colorectal cancer patients were diagnosed with more advanced tumors, including regional or distant malignancies, and were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63% for older patients) and receive radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%). While the reasons for this increase are not fully understood, factors like lifestyle choices, environmental influences, and possibly earlier-onset symptoms could be contributing.\n\nThe study highlights the need for healthcare providers to be vigilant in identifying colorectal cancer symptoms, especially in younger patients, as early detection is crucial. Guidelines for screening may need to be reconsidered, but experts caution that more research is needed to determine the optimal age for screening and the potential impact on cancer prevention.\n\nIn light of these findings, experts emphasize the importance of being aware of symptoms like anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark stool, particularly for those with a family history of cancer or at higher risk. However, the exact implications for changing screening recommendations are still uncertain, and further investigation is necessary to address the growing number of young colorectal cancer survivors who require long-term support.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

At the Warratyi rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a chance discovery by archaeologist Giles Hamm and aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard revealed a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, challenging the conventional timeline of human arrival in Australia. The site, containing sophisticated tools, bone fragments, and evidence of fire, demonstrates the presence of humans in the region much earlier than previously believed, potentially suggesting colonization as early as 49,000 to 46,000 years ago. The rock shelter holds significance as it showcases the development of technologies like stone axes, ochre use, and interactions with megafauna like the Diprotodon optatum, indicating a complex relationship between humans and extinct large mammals.\n\nThe excavation methods employed were meticulous, with hand excavation, grid systems, and careful handling of artefacts to preserve the integrity of the site. Optical dating of quartz grains and single-grain OSL and TT-OSL techniques were used to establish the age of the artefacts and sediments, providing a precise chronology. Radiocarbon dating of eggshells and charcoal fragments, along with Bayesian age modeling, confirmed the site's age and helped reconstruct the sequence of occupation.\n\nThe discovery pushes back the timeline of human settlement in arid Australia, challenging the notion that people arrived in the region only after 50,000 years ago. The presence of megafauna remains, along with evidence of coexistence and hunting, suggests a more complex picture of human-megafauna interactions. The study, published in Nature, contributes to a reevaluation of the ingenuity and adaptability of the early Aboriginal population, debunking Eurocentric assumptions about their technological prowess.\n\nThe findings at Warratyi rock shelter, along with the ongoing debate among archaeologists, highlight the rapid expansion of human habitation in Australia and the need for a reconsideration of the continent's colonization timeline and the role of humans in the extinction of megafauna.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The movie, \"Detroit,\" directed by Bigelow and co-written with Mark Boal, explores the systemic racism and police violence during the height of the riots, which left 43 dead and thousands injured.\n\nThe film, set against the backdrop of the Motor City's turbulent summer, examines the clash between the predominantly white police force and the predominantly Black community. While not shying away from depicting the brutality, it also portrays the moral conflict faced by some officers, like Will Poulter's character, who witness and are appalled by the acts of racism and violence.\n\nDetroit's opening sequence provides a historical context, highlighting the migration of Black Americans to the city and the resulting social disparities. The film's central event, the Algiers Motel incident, is a harrowing account of police misconduct, with the police, including Krauss, shown as catalysts for escalating violence. The film's portrayal of the National Guard and the police's handling of the situation raises questions about the justice system's biases.\n\nWhile \"Detroit\" is praised for its powerful and immersive filmmaking, it is criticized for its lack of character development, focusing more on the situational aspects rather than individual stories.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through resource acquisition and energy harvesting.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's theory proposes a three-step progression for civilizations seeking to dominate the universe. The first step involves utilizing a planet's resources (Type I), followed by harnessing a star's energy (Type II), and eventually capturing energy from an entire galaxy (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that civilizations must actively collect energy from distant stars to prevent being isolated due to the expanding universe's dark energy. As space expands, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible, necessitating proactive measures to secure resources.\n\nHooper argues that advanced civilizations, like those possibly at Type II or III, would comprehend the urgency and actively capture stars, forming Dyson spheres or other structures like solar-powered satellites (statites) to capture and transmit energy. This would enable them to counteract the effects of universal expansion and maintain access to energy sources.\n\nScience fiction has explored these concepts, such as Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\" and Freeman Dyson's proposal based on waste heat detection. Dyson spheres, envisioned as either solid shells or collections of statites, would be massive engineering feats, potentially requiring millions of satellites to surround a star and collect its energy.\n\nWhile humans are currently at a relatively early stage, the possibility of alien civilizations millions of years ahead suggests that they might have already reached the later stages of Kardashev's hierarchy. Detecting these advanced civilizations could involve observing unusual light signatures, like galaxies with harvested stars or Dyson spheres' telltale infrared radiation.\n\nIn summary, the news revolves around the scientific pursuit of understanding the potential for galactic-scale expansion and energy acquisition by advanced civilizations.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Initially, Stewart took over the show in 1999, replacing Craig Kilborn, amidst tensions with the existing staff who were resistant to his vision. Stewart's appointment was met with skepticism, but he aimed to differentiate the show from its predecessor by focusing on a more pointed, purposeful, and satirical approach.\n\nThe transition was marked by clashes, particularly during a \"fuck-you meeting\" where Stewart clashed with the writers, who felt their established format was being undermined. Key hires, such as head writer Ben Karlin and later addition of Stephen Colbert, brought a fresh perspective and a shift in the show's tone. Colbert's presence, with his deceptive charm, became an essential on-air collaborator.\n\nIn the early days, the show struggled to find its footing, with topics like Kilborn-era field pieces being criticized for targeting minor figures. However, the show's format evolved under Stewart's leadership, with a focus on political satire and deconstructing the news process. A turning point came during the 2000 campaign season, where the show covered the primaries, particularly a memorable segment with Steve Carell's unexpected interview of John McCain, which showcased a new level of incisiveness and humor.\n\nThe success of the show coincided with changes in the media landscape, with the rise of cable news networks like Fox News and MSNBC, and the decline of traditional TV news formats.

Researchers, publishing in Science, report on three key findings:\n\n1. Middle Stone Age advancements: Fossil evidence and newly excavated tools, dating back to around 320,000 years ago, suggest dramatic shifts in tool-making and possibly trading networks due to climate fluctuations. The tools, including obsidian-based spearpoints, indicate increased mobility and the need for long-distance resource acquisition, possibly indicating the rise of social networks among Homo sapiens or their relatives.\n\n2. Earlier innovations: The Olorgesailie tools, with their tear-drop shaped hand axes and the earliest Middle Stone Age tools, are found to be older than previously thought, pushing back the timeline of these technological advancements. The researchers attribute this change to the need to adapt to unpredictable food sources caused by recurring climate shifts.\n\n3. Climate-driven behavioral changes: The Olorgesailie region experienced frequent environmental changes, forcing early humans to develop more efficient, smaller tools like points and blades. This shift may have facilitated the expansion of social networks and trade among hominid populations.\n\n4. Long-distance connections: The use of obsidian, transported from afar, suggests the existence of long-distance trade and cooperation among hominids. The discovery of red pigment and the oldest known pigment application also imply symbolic communication and social organization.\n\n5. Earlier human innovations: The findings align with genetic evidence placing the origin of modern humans in Africa around 350,000 to 260,000 years ago. The Olorgesailie tools, with their sophistication, signal a transition to more modern behaviors by 300,000 years ago.\n\n6. Complex cultural shifts: While climate change played a significant role, researchers caution against assuming a single \"human revolution\" event. Instead, gradual changes in tool use and social structures emerged over time, possibly involving multiple hominid species.\n\nThese discoveries emphasize the importance of environmental factors in shaping human adaptation and the development of complex behaviors, challenging the traditional narrative of a sudden \"human revolution.\"", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Gibson CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, maintained that the company had purchased wood legally and claimed to have followed all necessary regulations. However, the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) director, Andrea Johnson, stated that the Lacey Act requires end-users to verify the legality of their supply chain, and EIA's investigations suggested that Gibson was aware of the risks associated with using potentially illegal wood from Madagascar and took steps to maintain a supply chain despite the ban.\n\nThe raids led to the seizure of shipments of ebony and raised concerns among other guitar manufacturers, such as C.F.

A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a substantial portion of the Martian northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, which reached depths of up to a mile, persisted for millions of years, providing a warm and wet environment that could have supported the possibility of life.\n\nThe research, conducted by NASA scientists using infrared telescopes, found that the planet had a substantial amount of water, with a global ocean covering nearly half the planet's surface. The ocean's existence was inferred from the high concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, in the Martian atmosphere. The enrichment indicates extensive water loss, with estimates suggesting a global ocean depth of up to 137 meters at its peak.\n\nMars' water loss, primarily due to the thinning atmosphere, led to the formation of a global ocean that eventually froze and retreated, leaving behind the polar ice caps. The presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere, although not necessarily indicating life, adds to the intrigue about potential past habitability.\n\nThese findings challenge earlier beliefs about the sporadic nature of water on Mars, suggesting a more prolonged and widespread presence.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Despite its initial premise as a peek into the world of swindlers, the film is criticized for lacking depth and authenticity, with many reviewers pointing out the exaggerated and unrealistic portrayal of the criminal underworld.\n\nWill Smith's performance as Nicky brings a charm reminiscent of his earlier roles, showcasing his ability to convince with a cool demeanor. However, the film's romantic subplot between Smith and Margot Robbie's character, Jess, is described as shallow, with Smith's acting style not fully utilized due to the lack of emotional depth in the script.\n\nThe casting process for the film was notable, with various high-profile actors rumored to be attached to the project before Will Smith and Margot Robbie secured the roles.

The film's directorial choices and the characters' banter offer a few enjoyable, if somewhat contrived, encounters.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Focus\" is a movie that offers a blend of charm, style, and a disappointing lack of substance, with Will Smith's performance being a highlight amidst an otherwise underwhelming cinematic experience.", "answers": ["Will Smith stars as Nicky, an established con man who takes on a new apprentice, Australian newcomer Margot Robbie's Jess, in Focus.

{"pred": "In a recent legal development, the European Court of Justice has dismissed appeals by both Nestlé and Mondelez, the makers of Kit Kat and Cadbury, respectively, regarding the shape of the iconic four-fingered chocolate bar. Nestlé had been attempting to trademark the shape of its Kit Kat since 2002, claiming it was distinctive enough to be protected. However, the court ruled that the shape alone does not confer sufficient distinctiveness to maintain the trademark, requiring evidence of recognition across all EU member states, not just a significant part. This decision annuls Nestlé's appeal and sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office for reconsideration.\n\nThe ruling affects not only Kit Kat but also other similar products like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which has been producing a four-fingered chocolate bar since 1937. The case highlights the challenge for companies to prove that a product's shape is distinctive enough to warrant trademark protection, with the court emphasizing that it must be recognizable in every EU market.\n\nIn addition to the Kit Kat shape, the ruling has broader implications for trademark law, particularly for companies operating within the EU single market. The outcome of the case could lead to a reassessment of other shapes and designs that have been trademarked, potentially opening the door for competitors to create similar products without infringing on the original trademarks.\n\nThe Kit Kat shape battle has been ongoing for over a decade, with Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, also disputing the trademark. Meanwhile, Nestlé is expected to continue fighting, although the court's decision suggests a significant hurdle for the company to overcome. The case has attracted attention due to its potential impact on the chocolate industry and the perception of Brexit, as some saw it as an example of perceived EU interference in British traditions.\n\nIn related trademark disputes, Nestlé also lost a case against Cadbury's purple color for its Dairy Milk bars, while Nestlé's attempt to trademark the shape of the Toblerone bar was successful, though the case involving the shape of the chocolate bar remains ongoing. Overall, the ruling emphasizes the need for clear evidence of distinctiveness across the entire EU market for a trademark to be upheld.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic roar of the T. rex, suggesting that dinosaurs, including the mighty predator, likely made sounds quite different from what we see in movies like \"Jurassic Park.\" According to a study published in the journal Evolution, dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies like birds, might have produced closed-mouth vocalizations akin to cooing or a muffled growl, similar to the coo of a pigeon or the low rumble of an ostrich. These sounds are generated through an esophageal pouch, a feature shared by some birds, indicating that the ability could have evolved independently in dinosaurs.\n\nThe study, involving researchers from various institutions, analyzed the vocalizations of living and extinct animals, including birds and crocodiles, to uncover patterns in closed-mouth sounds. It found that roughly a quarter of bird species analyzed emit such sounds, with larger-bodied birds like doves, ostriches, and cassowaries being the most likely candidates for dinosaur vocalizations. The researchers suggest that the T. rex might have resembled an ostrich or a bird with a large body, emitting a low, throaty sound.\n\nWhile the iconic T. rex roar from \"Jurassic Park\" is a cinematic invention, the sound designer responsible for the film, Gary Rydstrom, mixed together various animal sounds to create the dinosaurs' vocalizations. For instance, the raptors' calls featured a tortoise's mating call, a goose's hiss, and even a baby elephant's breath for the T. rex's roar. The team behind the movie used creative techniques, like slowing down sounds and incorporating animal noises, to bring dinosaurs to life on screen.\n\nThe study highlights the uncertainty surrounding dinosaur vocalizations, as most dinosaur sounds remain a mystery due to the lack of fossil evidence. However, the findings suggest that dinosaurs, especially those with large bodies, might have had the ability to produce low-frequency, throaty vocalizations, possibly resembling the coo of a bird or the mumble of an ostrich.\n\nThe research underscores the complexity of dinosaur vocalizations and the potential for dinosaurs to have communicated in ways beyond the iconic roars often portrayed. As our understanding of dinosaur biology expands, it opens up a fascinating world of possibilities, revealing that the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park might have been more nuanced and diverse in their vocal expressions than initially thought.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

This technology allows scientists to potentially \"read\" dynamic visual experiences, including dreams and thoughts, by analyzing brain activity during visual processing.\n\nThe study, led by Shinji Nishimoto and Jack Gallant, demonstrates a leap towards understanding how the brain processes visual information, with implications for decoding internal imagery and potentially offering insights into the mind's private cinema.

The research also highlights the need for further exploration of the brain's various visual modules to improve the accuracy and resolution of these reconstructions.\n\nOverall, these findings represent a major advancement in neuroscience, bringing scientists closer to understanding the inner workings of the human mind and potentially opening doors to assist individuals with paralysis or other conditions through brain-computer interfaces.

The report highlights a concern raised during the attack that State Department officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were worried about the potential impact of Marines wearing uniforms, as it could hinder diplomacy. The committee found that the administration initially blamed the attack on an anti-Islam video, despite knowing that it was a terrorist act, not a protest. The report disputes the claim that the attack was solely due to a video, stating that it was a well-planned terrorist operation involving Ansar al-Sharia, an affiliate of al-Qaeda.\n\nThe report includes a timeline contrasting public statements with private communications, showing discrepancies in the administration's narrative. It exposes that the Obama administration initially tried to attribute the Benghazi attack to an anti-Islam video, even as they were aware of the true nature of the event. The report also accuses the administration of providing false information to the public, with Clinton's initial statement suggesting the attack was sparked by a protest, while private communications acknowledged it as a terrorist act.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, criticized the process, accusing Chairman Trey Gowdy of attempting to prevent accountability and hide information from the public. Cummings argues that the report does not fundamentally alter the understanding of the attack, but adds granularity to the facts, confirming that there was no stand-down order, no attempt to politicize the situation, and no evidence of gun trading.\n\nThe report concludes with a focus on the administration's handling of the situation, particularly regarding Secretary Clinton's role in blaming the video for the violence, even after receiving contrary information.

How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed.

Developing countries are witnessing a faster increase in obesity rates, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and other nations topping the list for women, and New Zealand, Bahrain, and the US for men.\n\nThe obesity epidemic is linked to factors such as the abundance of cheap, high-calorie, and unhealthy foods, as well as declining physical activity. Chronic health issues resulting from obesity, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, claim millions of lives annually. Efforts to curb obesity are limited, with no clear success stories identified in the past three decades.\n\nThe Lancet report calls for urgent action to address this global health challenge, emphasizing the need to tackle obesity at a population level and find strategies to reverse the trend, especially in developing countries where obesity rates are skyrocketing.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns. The 188-country study found that there are 2.1 billion overweight or obese people in the world, making up around 30% of the world's population, up from 20% in 1980, USA Today reports. Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}
{"pred": "On Tuesday, news outlets reported that Tom Cruise, following a year since his divorce from Katie Holmes, has reached out to her with an emotional letter. The surprise gesture comes as Cruise attempts to rekindle their friendship, despite their separation. According to insiders, Cruise's decision to write was prompted by the realization of the reasons behind Holmes' departure and a desire to express his feelings without the need for a phone call. Holmes, who has moved to New York City with their daughter Suri, has reportedly been touched by the letter, acknowledging the depth of Cruise's emotions but seemingly not considering a reunion at this time. Meanwhile, LOOK magazine released its latest issue, featuring key trends for the new season, along with warnings from a royal bodyguard about the safety of Kate Middleton's baby, and discussions on cyber spying and celebrity make-up secrets.

Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one.

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country held its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to solidify its lead, followed by the more conservative Nour party. The first phase of the vote saw Islamist groups gain significant ground, raising concerns about their influence in the new parliament. Egyptians cast their ballots amidst ongoing trials of former President Hosni Mubarak, who was accused of being a \"tyrant\" by prosecutors, who called for a harsh penalty. Mubarak's trial, which resumes after a two-month break, focuses on his role in suppressing protests and the use of violence against protesters.\n\nThe election comes as the military junta, which took over after Mubarak's ouster, faces criticism for its reluctance to cede power. The new parliament's composition could impact the balance of power, with the Brotherhood aiming to form a coalition or a balanced government. Economic challenges, including a decline in foreign currency reserves and a struggling stock market, loom large in the backdrop of these political developments.\n\nThe trial against Mubarak and his sons, including Gamal, who is accused of seeking to succeed his father, continues. Prosecutors painted Mubarak as a tyrant responsible for violence against Egyptians, while his defense remains silent on the first day of the prosecution's argument. The outcome of the elections and Mubarak's trial could shape the future of Egypt's political landscape and its transition from military rule.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house.

Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far.

A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine revealed that MRSA becomes more virulent and difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. The smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, thereby enhancing its survival and invasiveness.\n\nIn a separate study, the team also investigated e-cigarette smoke, finding similar effects but with less pronounced resistance compared to traditional cigarette smoke. The research suggests that cigarette smoke acts as an alarm for MRSA, triggering a defense mechanism that increases its resistance to host immune responses and makes it more capable of causing infections.\n\nThese findings highlight the double-edged nature of smoking, with both smokers and non-smokers at risk due to the increased prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from the previous year's total by that time. The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7 during the 2014 outbreak, and symptoms include rapid muscle weakness, particularly in the limbs and respiratory issues.\n\nAFM cases have been reported in at least 17 states, with some experts suggesting a potential link to enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a virus that circulated in 2014 during the last major AFM outbreak. However, no definitive cause has been established, and the CDC is investigating various viruses, including EV-D68, as potential culprits. Treatment options are limited to supportive care, with some doctors reporting possible improvement with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and anecdotal evidence suggesting Prozac might be beneficial.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak saw 121 cases, with recovery rates varying; while most children experienced partial recovery, only a small percentage fully regained function. The condition remains rare, with the CDC urging vigilance but cautioning against alarm due to the low number of confirmed cases. The 2016 surge has raised concerns among healthcare professionals, with some fearing a repeat of the 2014 outbreak.\n\nParents and families, like Robin Roberts and Angie Andersen, have shared harrowing stories of their children's sudden paralysis, highlighting the need for more research and understanding of the condition. The CDC is actively monitoring the situation, requesting increased reporting and considering potential treatments based on emerging evidence.\n\nAs the number of AFM cases rises, health officials advise maintaining good hygiene to prevent the spread of potential triggers like enteroviruses. While the cause remains uncertain, the 2016 cases have prompted renewed interest in studying enteroviruses, with some researchers experimenting with mice models to better understand the connection between EV-D68 and AFM.\n\nIn conclusion, Acute Flaccid Myelitis, a mysterious and potentially polio-like illness, is on the rise, raising concerns among parents and health authorities.

Regional leaders, including President Alassane Ouattara, have responded swiftly by forming a diplomatic committee that threatens sanctions if the junta does not restore constitutional order.\n\nWest Africa's vulnerability is highlighted by the swift fall of cities in the north, with the military's inability to mount a counter-attack. The international community, including the United Nations, has yet to fully engage, emphasizing the urgency of outside support to prevent a total collapse. The situation has led to an economic crisis in Mali, with fuel shortages and a potential halt in imports, causing long queues at gas stations and concerns about the electricity grid.\n\nThe UNESCO warns that the fighting in northern Mali, particularly in Timbuktu, poses a risk to the city's UNESCO World Heritage site, which includes unique mud and wood architecture.

Despite the challenging environment, Dudley's pay package, including a $1.4 million cash bonus and a total of $4.2 million, was approved, with 59% of proxy votes against it. This marked the first time in decades that a top UK company faced a shareholder rebellion over executive pay, with rival energy CEOs seeing pay cuts.\n\nGlass Lewis, a shareholder advisory firm, recommended voting against the pay packages, citing underperformance and the need for greater alignment with shareholder interests. BP's board, however, defended the decision, stating that Dudley had met targets related to safety, operational cash flow, and strategic goals. The company's chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, pledged to review the pay policy in consultation with shareholders and hinted at potential changes for future years.\n\nBP's dividend proposal was also put into question, with the possibility of a reduction due to the impact of low oil prices. The company's response to the shareholder backlash was to signal a commitment to addressing concerns, without specifying concrete actions beyond discussing changes with major investors.\n\nThe severity of the shareholder revolt extended beyond BP, as other companies like Smith & Nephew and Shell also faced shareholder discontent over executive pay. The growing trend of shareholder activism highlights the pressure on companies to align executive compensation with performance and shareholder satisfaction.\n\nWhile some defended Dudley's pay as commensurate with industry standards, critics argue that his pay rise was excessive, especially considering pay cuts at rival energy companies.

The exquisitely preserved fossil revealed a mix of dark feathers and iridescent ones, particularly on the head, neck, and chest, suggesting vibrant colors that changed with light.\n\nCaihong had a theropod-like body, with a Velociraptor-like skull and sharp teeth, but it also displayed unique features like a crested head, iridescent feathers on its head and neck, and possibly a functional role in attracting mates or aiding in flight, though the latter is debated. The dinosaur's relatively short but strong forelimbs indicate a possible adaptation for gliding or display, with the earliest known asymmetric feathers on its tail suggesting the potential for aerodynamic control.\n\nThe study, published in Nature Communications, combines paleontological findings with modern analysis of nanostructures in the fossilized feathers, revealing that Caihong's melanosomes, the pigmentation units, were similar to those in modern birds. The dinosaur's colorful feathers suggest a more vibrant world than previously imagined, with iridescence possibly playing a role in social displays or courtship.\n\nThis discovery pushes the understanding of dinosaur plumage and its potential functions, as well as the evolution of colorful displays in prehistoric creatures. The presence of feathers on the dinosaur's head and tail, along with the asymmetrical feathers on the caudal vertebrae, points to the possibility of aerial display or even flight capabilities, though the exact function remains speculative.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

However, the tax faced significant backlash due to its regressive nature, with opponents including businesses, unions, and various interest groups. Retailers like Costco responded by informing customers about cheaper alternatives outside the city, causing a decrease in revenue as people voted with their wallets. Seattle's tax exempted beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, sparking debate about consistency in targeting. The tax led to price hikes, with a case of Gatorade increasing by over 64% and prompted Seattleites to shop in neighboring areas to avoid the surcharge.\n\nSimilarily, a Cook County tax on sugary beverages was repealed within two months due to public outrage, with businesses like Costco and the beverage industry celebrating the defeat. Critics argue that soda taxes don't improve health, drive customers out of cities, and disproportionately affect low-income individuals. Seattle's tax has prompted calls for a consistent approach and questioned the fairness of targeting specific beverages.\n\nThe Seattle soda tax has led to price hikes at retailers like Costco, with customers feeling the financial strain. The tax's lack of uniformity and potential to hurt low-income households has fueled discontent.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

They were diagnosed with more distant and metastatic tumors, and had higher survival rates despite the severity of their disease.\n\nYounger patients were more inclined to receive surgery and radiation therapy compared to older counterparts.

At the Warratyi rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, a chance discovery by archaeologist Giles Hamm and aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard revealed a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, challenging the conventional wisdom about the timing of human arrival in Australia. The site holds significance due to the presence of sophisticated tools, including sophisticated stone axes, ochre use, and evidence of interactions with megafauna like the Diprotodon optatum, suggesting a more extensive colonization than previously believed.\n\nThe excavation uncovered 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, with some dating back to 46,000 years ago. This pushes the timeline of human settlement in the arid regions 10,000 years earlier than previously estimated. The presence of megafauna remains indicates possible hunting and coexistence, which raises questions about the role of humans in the extinction of megafauna.\n\nRadiocarbon dating of eggshells and charcoal from the site indicate a sequence of occupation between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago, while Bayesian age modeling incorporated various dating methods to create a comprehensive chronology. The findings challenge the notion of a simple migration pattern and highlight the sophistication of early human technology and cultural practices.\n\nThe oldest known evidence of ochre use and the development of key technologies, such as bone tools and stone axes, were also discovered, suggesting local innovation rather than reliance on imported knowledge. The presence of megafauna remains at the site, like the Diprotodon and ancient bird eggs, adds to the debate about the relationship between humans and megafauna.\n\nThese discoveries, published in the journal Nature, contribute to a revised understanding of the spread and adaptation of early humans in Australia, challenging Eurocentric views on the complexity of Indigenous cultures and the timeline of human settlement in the continent.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

The movie, which combines factual elements with some fictional liberties, highlights the harsh reality of police brutality and the lack of accountability for officers involved in such incidents.\n\nThe film starts with a historical context, detailing the migration of Black Americans to cities like Detroit, leading to the combustible social conditions that fueled the riots. It features intense scenes, such as the Algiers Motel confrontation, where police, including a young patrolman played by Will Poulter, inflict violence on innocent civilians, including musicians and tourists caught in the crossfire.\n\nWhile the film doesn't shy away from depicting the brutality, it also portrays the moral dilemma faced by some officers, like the commanding officer who restrains his men but ultimately fails to hold them accountable. The movie's portrayal of the National Guard and the police response during the riots raises questions about systemic racism and the treatment of Black citizens.\n\n\"Detroit\" is a powerful and emotionally charged film that leaves a lasting impact, despite its focus on character development and the complexities of the situation.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through resource acquisition and energy harvesting.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's theory proposes a three-step progression for civilizations seeking to dominate the universe. The first step involves utilizing a planet's resources (Type I), followed by harnessing a star's energy (Type II), and ultimately capturing energy from an entire galaxy (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that civilizations must actively capture energy from distant stars to prevent being isolated due to the expanding universe's dark energy. As space expands, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible, necessitating proactive measures to secure energy sources.\n\nHooper argues that advanced civilizations, aware of their cosmic fate, would strive to construct massive structures like Dyson spheres – either as static shells or swarms of statites – to capture and harness energy from stars. These structures, inspired by science fiction concepts like Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\" and Freeman Dyson's proposal, would be a sign of extremely advanced societies.\n\nWhile humanity is currently at a relatively early stage (Type I), the possibility of alien civilizations at more advanced levels is considered. The search for such civilizations could involve observing unusual light signatures in galaxies, such as those with harvested stars or Dyson spheres, which would indicate the presence of an active civilization harvesting energy from its surroundings.\n\nIn summary, the news revolves around the expansionist ambitions of advanced civilizations, driven by the need for energy and the looming threat of cosmic isolation due to dark energy.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers, publishing in Science, report on significant advancements in toolmaking and potential trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives around 320,000 years ago, during the Middle Stone Age. The shifts in East African climate, marked by alternating wet and dry periods, are believed to have driven behavioral changes, including the development of smaller, specialized tools and increased mobility.\n\nThe excavated tools, some of which are the oldest of their kind, suggest a transition from larger, simpler tools like hand axes and oval hand axes to the more precise Middle Stone Age tools, possibly indicating the need for long-distance trade and social networking. Obsidian tools, often associated with Homo sapiens, arrived from far-off locations, implying the existence of inter-group communication and resource exchanges.\n\nThe research also connects these developments to the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, potentially marking the beginning of modern human cognition. However, the exact link between climate change, technological advancements, and the rise of Homo sapiens is still uncertain due to gaps in the archaeological record. The Olorgesailie findings challenge the traditional view of a single \"human revolution\" around 40,000-50,000 years ago, suggesting that the process of becoming modern began much earlier, driven by environmental pressures.\n\nThe Olorgesailie discoveries include evidence of long-distance trade in obsidian and the use of red pigment, pointing to symbolic communication and social organization. This aligns with genetic evidence placing the origin of Homo sapiens in Africa around 350,000 to 260,000 years ago. The researchers emphasize that the Middle Stone Age tools and behaviors, such as the ability to adapt to changing landscapes and develop specialized tools, demonstrate the cognitive flexibility of early humans.\n\nWhile the Olorgesailie findings shed light on the roots of modern human behaviors, the relationship between these innovations and the rise of Homo sapiens remains complex, with multiple hominid species present during this time. The archaeological record across Africa shows a gradual progression of technological advancements, challenging the notion of a single revolutionary event. Instead, it highlights a continuous process of adaptation and innovation in response to environmental changes, suggesting that the \"human revolution\" was a more gradual and widespread phenomenon than initially believed.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Over time, Cruz's academic performance improved, and he tested out of special education under the guidance of teachers like Harris. Linda's love and support led to a significant turning point in December 1982, when Cruz's attitude shifted, and he began to embrace a healthier lifestyle.\n\nCruz's desire to formally adopt his teacher's surname and change his last name to Hooper came after years of living with the Hoopers.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes. Prosin, meanwhile, says her group isn't stopping with the chimps and will also target the release of other animals.

Gibson, a prominent instrument maker, maintained that it had purchased the wood legally and was complying with regulations, but the government cited emails suggesting the company was aware of potential legal issues with the supply chain.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) director, Andrea Johnson, argued that the Lacey Act required companies like Gibson to verify the legality of their wood sourcing, including tracing it back to the tree. She claimed that Gibson had visited Madagascar to assess the possibility of sourcing from illegally harvested forests, despite the export ban on certain woods. Gibson denied these allegations, stating that they had stopped importing wood from Madagascar after the coup that raised concerns about the legitimacy of the government.\n\nThe situation also affected other guitar manufacturers, such as C.F. Martin & Co., who faced potential retroactive implications of the Lacey Act, as the law's enforcement could extend to vintage instruments and wood sourced years ago. Some, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, criticized the law's retroactivity and the potential burden on guitar collectors and sellers.\n\nGeorge Gruhn, a prominent guitar dealer, expressed concern about the impact on the industry, stating that the strict enforcement could lead to unintended consequences and hinder the trade of vintage instruments.

{"pred": "Recent studies based on observations of Mars' atmosphere have revealed significant discoveries about the planet's ancient water history. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a substantial portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, which reached depths of up to a mile, persisted for millions of years, providing a warm and wet environment that could have supported the potential for life.\n\nThe water on Mars was initially abundant, with a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. The isotopic analysis of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere indicates a high concentration of deuterium, suggesting extensive water loss over time. The enrichment in deuterium suggests Mars' polar reservoirs had water ice with a D/H ratio enriched by a factor of 7 to 8 times Earth's ocean (VSMOW), indicating a substantial amount of water loss.\n\nAs the planet evolved, Mars lost most of its water due to atmospheric thinning, leaving only about 13% of the original ocean in the polar caps today. The presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere, although not necessarily implying life, adds to the intrigue about the possibility of past habitability. The findings challenge earlier beliefs about the sporadic nature of water on Mars, suggesting a more prolonged and widespread presence.\n\nThese discoveries strengthen the case for Mars being a more habitable environment in its past, raising hopes that it could have provided conditions suitable for the emergence or sustenance of life. Future missions, such as the Exomars rover, will continue the search for signs of past or present microbial existence on the Red Planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "In a recent legal development, the European Court of Justice has dismissed appeals by both Nestlé and Mondelez, the makers of Kit Kat and Cadbury, respectively, regarding the shape of the iconic four-fingered chocolate bar. Nestlé had been attempting to maintain a trademark on the shape of its Kit Kat since 2002, arguing that it was distinctive enough to be protected. However, the court ruled that the shape alone does not confer sufficient distinctiveness to warrant trademark protection, as it must be recognized as distinctive in every EU country, not just a significant part of it.\n\nThe case highlights the complexity of trademark laws, particularly in the context of globally recognized products like Kit Kat. While Nestlé believes it still has a chance to appeal and provide stronger evidence of distinctiveness, the current ruling requires a demonstration of recognition across the entire EU market. This decision affects not only Kit Kat but also other similar snacks like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which has a similar four-fingered design.\n\nThe ruling has broader implications for trademark disputes, as it sets a precedent that a product's shape must be distinctive in all EU member states for it to be eligible for trademark protection. The case has been closely watched by legal experts and has occasionally been cited in discussions about Brexit, with some suggesting that the ruling could impact the protection of British brands in the face of EU regulations.\n\nAdditionally, the ruling touches on other trademark battles, such as Cadbury's attempt to trademark the purple color used for its Dairy Milk bars, which faced a similar legal challenge. The Kit Kat shape trademark case may now return to the EU Intellectual Property Office for further reconsideration based on the court's findings.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic roar of the T. rex, suggesting that dinosaurs, including the mighty predator, likely made sounds quite different from what we see in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" According to a study published in the journal Evolution, dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies like birds, might have communicated with closed-mouth vocalizations akin to cooing or a muffled roar, unlike the high-pitched roars associated with mammals. The study, involving multiple species of birds and crocodiles, found that closed-mouth sounds, which include the coo of a dove or the low rumble of an ostrich, evolved independently at least 16 times in birds, hinting that dinosaurs might have possessed similar abilities.\n\nThe researchers, led by University of Texas biologist Chad Eliason, analyzed the vocalizations of living and extinct animals, focusing on the distribution of closed-mouth sounds in birds and crocodiles. They discovered that birds with large bodies, such as doves and ostriches, were more likely to emit these sounds during mating displays. The study authors suggest that the T. rex, despite its fearsome appearance, might have produced sounds similar to the ostrich's low, throaty calls.\n\nThe creation of dinosaur sounds in movies, like the iconic T. rex roar, largely relied on creative liberties. For instance, the T. rex's roar in \"Jurassic Park\" was a composite of various animal sounds, including baby elephant cries, tiger growls, and an alligator's gurgle. The film's raptors, on the other hand, had elements of real-life goose vocalizations, with the hiss before an ambush resembling a goose's angry hiss.\n\nThe study also highlights the lack of knowledge about dinosaur vocalizations due to the scarcity of fossil evidence for vocal organs. However, the researchers speculate that dinosaurs, with their air sacs, could have produced bird-like closed-mouth sounds, possibly resembling the coo of a dove or the low, throaty calls of large-bodied birds like ostriches.\n\nThe findings emphasize the importance of understanding the evolution of vocalizations in dinosaurs, as it could provide insights into their communication and behavior. While the exact sounds remain a mystery, the study contributes to the ongoing debate and opens up possibilities for future research combining paleontology, comparative biology, and sound modeling to piece together the dinosaurian chorus.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The probability distribution is updated as new information emerges, favoring areas closer to the probable location given the suspected deliberate diversion, rather than accidents.

A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine has demonstrated that MRSA becomes more virulent and difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. The smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it more resistant to the body's immune defenses, such as reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides. The study, published in Infection and Immunity, also compared MRSA's response to e-cigarette smoke, with cigarette smoke having a significantly greater impact on bacterial resistance.\n\nThe research, led by Dr. Laura E.

The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke remained more resistant to bacterial killing mechanisms even 24 hours after exposure, suggesting a potential long-lasting impact. The findings also showed that MRSA exposed to smoke was more successful in invading human cells and causing pneumonia in mice.\n\nThis study adds to previous research that links smoking to enhanced bacterial resistance, with e-cigarette vapor also having a lesser but still notable effect.

The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7 during the 2014 outbreak, and symptoms include rapid muscle weakness, particularly in the limbs and respiratory issues.\n\nAFM cases have been reported in multiple states, with some experts suggesting a possible link to enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a virus that circulated in 2014 during the previous AFM outbreak. However, no definitive cause has been established, and the CDC is investigating various factors, including enteroviruses and other viral infections. Treatment options are limited to supportive care, with no proven cure or marked improvement from treatments like IV immunoglobulin or Prozac.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak saw 120 cases, mostly in children, with only a few recovering fully. The condition remains rare, with the CDC urging vigilance and monitoring of potential clusters.

Using live subjects and mannequins, they tested various blood flow scenarios, such as trickles from wounds on the left hand, forearms, and a simulated spear wound, comparing them to the patterns observed on the shroud.\n\nTheir study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, reveals inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns, which do not align with the expected flow from a crucifixion scenario.

Approximately 8 million children are separated from their families due to poverty, lack of resources, or disabilities, leading to devastating consequences for their development and well-being. Institutions, even those with some resources, have been shown to cause significant harm, with children facing higher risks of abuse, neglect, and lifelong impacts on their health and employability.\n\nLumos's work focuses on advocating for ending the widespread practice of institutionalization and promoting family-based care. The organization cites successful examples from countries like Moldova, where a 70% reduction in institutionalized children has been achieved, and the Czech Republic, with a goal to make 2020 the last year of admitting children to institutions. By supporting inclusive education, health services, and fostering/adoption programs, Lumos aims to create a model that prioritizes keeping families together and improving the lives of these children.\n\nThe launch of the #Letstalklumos social media campaign aims to raise awareness about the issue and encourage international donors, including the EU, US, and the Global Alliance for Children, to continue their support for eradicating the practice of institutionalization.

The FBI initially opposed the memo's release, citing concerns about classified information and potential damage to national security. President Donald Trump eventually approved the declassification of the memo, acknowledging the importance of balancing national security with transparency, as the Constitution allows for the President to classify or declassify information for the public interest.\n\nThe memo highlights concerns over the use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the DOJ and FBI, specifically mentioning the reliance on a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy, which was funded by the DNC and Clinton campaign. The memo claims that the dossier's political origins were not disclosed to the FISA court, despite the FBI knowing about them. It also criticizes the FBI for not disclosing Steele's termination due to unauthorized media contacts and his anti-Trump biases.\n\nIn the second passage, the focus shifts to a tweet discussing the ability to add location information to tweets, with the option to delete location history.

The so-called \"Pishtaco\" gang was said to have murdered up to 60 people and sold their fat for a substantial profit.\n\nHowever, following an investigation, police in Lima and Huanuco revealed that the case was deeply flawed.

In 2015, the number of permits issued for the Northbound thru-hike reached unprecedented levels, and the trend continued in 2016, with permits indicating a potential overflow of hikers. The surge has raised concerns about overcrowding, environmental impact, and the strain on local communities, as inexperienced hikers, often seeking personal redemption, join the trail.\n\nThe PCTA introduced a permit system in 2015 to manage the growing numbers, limiting daily permits to 50 per day, with fears that the fragile desert ecosystems could suffer from increased human activity. The system aims to maintain the trail's integrity and minimize rescue operations. Despite efforts to disperse hikers, anecdotal evidence suggests that the trail remains busy, with some estimating around 3,000 people attempting the full hike in 2016.\n\nThe hike is not just attracting more women, as suggested by the rise in female hikers, possibly influenced by Strayed's story.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

After being spotted on the show, the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office removed her from the missing persons list. Rebekah's case highlights the issue of people being listed as missing due to various reasons, including temporary disappearances or personal choices, as well as the high number of missing persons reports in Humboldt County, which has the highest per-capita rate in California.\n\nThe county's high rate of missing persons is not solely due to cold cases or serial killings, but also includes runaways, particularly among children in foster care, and individuals who may be transient due to work in the cannabis industry. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office receives around 40 missing persons reports per month, with most cases being resolved quickly. The department acknowledges that some reports are due to misunderstandings or voluntary disappearances, and they encourage family members to stay in contact to avoid unnecessary listings.\n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's data suggests that Humboldt County's high missing children reports are primarily from runaways, with many cases resolved within days. The Humboldt 35, a list of 35 people reported missing on the California Attorney General's website, includes cases that date back to 1977, with some unresolved cases like the 1997 disappearance of a mother and her daughters, and the ongoing search for a 47-year-old man named Mitchell Hernandez.\n\nPrivate investigator Todd Matthews, founder of the NamUs database, points out the need for a standardized reporting system for missing persons across the country.

Researchers found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen, a commonly recommended pain reliever, had a higher likelihood of their children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related issues. The study, conducted on 64,000 Danish children, observed a correlation between acetaminophen use and a 29% increased risk of ADHD, particularly when taken for extended periods. While the study does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, it suggests that pregnant women may want to reconsider long-term or excessive use of the drug.\n\nExperts caution that the study does not imply that occasional use is harmful, but rather advise against chronic or prolonged intake. Other factors, such as viral infections or genetic predispositions, could also play a role. Notably, the study does not compare acetaminophen to other pain relievers like ibuprofen.\n\nWhile acknowledging the need to balance risks, some experts recommend alternative pain management methods during pregnancy, like massages, baths, or acupuncture, instead of relying solely on acetaminophen. The FDA has warned about the potential risks associated with large doses, and the study's authors call for more research to better understand the potential hormonal effects on fetal development.\n\nMcNeil Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Tylenol, advises pregnant women to consult their doctors before taking any medication, emphasizing that there is currently no definitive evidence linking acetaminophen to adverse effects on child development.

Democrats, led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, are refusing to budge on any changes to the ACA, fearing it could lead to a major setback for the law and a political backlash. Republicans are considering a short-term funding bill with the goal of delaying the ACA, but Democrats are likely to reject any amendments targeting the law.\n\nIf the deadlock persists, the Senate, which is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday, might face calls to act swiftly.

Now, he and his colleague Konstantin Batygin have presented compelling evidence for a potential ninth planet, which they call \"Planet Nine\" or \"Planet X.\" Based on mathematical models and the gravitational influence on distant dwarf planets, they estimate its mass as five to 10 times that of Earth, making it a gas giant.\n\nThe existence of Planet Nine would challenge current models of the solar system's formation and dynamics.

{"pred": "This summary highlights two main themes: the exploration of galactic expansion and the potential for advanced civilizations to overcome cosmic isolation through energy harvesting.\n\nIn the realm of astrophysics, Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev's three-step plan for dominating the universe, as outlined in his 1962 model, has gained renewed attention. The model categorizes civilizations based on their energy consumption, with Type I (planet-bound), Type II (star-bound), and Type III (galaxy-bound) civilizations. A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that to survive the expanding universe, advanced civilizations must harvest energy from distant stars before they become inaccessible due to dark energy-driven cosmic expansion. This would involve constructing Dyson spheres or other energy-gathering structures, like solar-powered satellites, to capture and utilize starlight.\n\nOlaf Stapledon's science fiction and physicist Freeman Dyson's proposals inspired by Stapledon's work suggest that ancient, advanced civilizations might have already achieved such structures, like Dyson spheres or statites (satellites in stable orbits that collect and beam starlight back to their home planet). These megastructures could indicate the presence of civilizations that have surpassed the Kardashev scale, potentially reaching Type III status.\n\nWhile humanity is currently at a relatively early stage, with estimates placing us around a 0.7 on the Kardashev scale, the search for alien life might reveal signs of these advanced civilizations, such as unusual light signatures or galaxies with missing stars due to energy harvesting. As the universe expands, the race against dark energy becomes a key factor in the quest for interstellar contact and the possibility of encountering civilizations that have mastered the art of harvesting energy from the cosmos.\n\nIn summary, the news revolves around the theoretical progression of civilizations through the Kardashev scale, the importance of energy harvesting in light of cosmic isolation, and the speculative technology like Dyson spheres that could be indicative of advanced extraterrestrial life. The search for these signs could provide insights into the existence of other intelligent beings in the universe.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Initially, Stewart took over the show in 1999, replacing Craig Kilborn, amidst tensions with the existing staff who were resistant to his vision. Stewart's appointment marked a shift in the show's tone, from a more lighthearted approach to a more pointed and purposeful satire. Key hires, such as Ben Karlin and later David Javerbaum, brought a new perspective to the writing, focusing on hypocrisy and political issues. The show's format evolved, with Stewart addressing the 2000 presidential campaign, particularly during a memorable segment where he grilled Senator John McCain, marking a turning point in the show's credibility and political relevance.\n\nSteve Carell and Stephen Colbert, with their unique comedic styles, became integral to the show's success. Carell's addition as a correspondent, followed by Colbert's gradual rise, brought a fresh dynamic to the on-air presence. The show's transition from a Kilborn-era comedy to a more political commentary format was met with resistance from some writers, but Stewart's determination and leadership eventually shaped the show into a cultural phenomenon.\n\nThe Daily Show's success coincided with changes in the broader media landscape, as cable news networks like Fox News and MSNBC emerged, challenging the traditional news format. The show's ability to deconstruct and parody the news media, particularly in the 2000 campaign coverage, earned it critical acclaim and a dedicated fan base.\n\nThroughout the summary, Jon Stewart reflects on the challenges he faced, including power struggles and adapting the show's direction, while maintaining a commitment to finding the \"real news\" beneath the surface.

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show.

Marketing chief Phil Schiller's explanation, which included phrases like \"moving on\" and \"courageous,\" was met with widespread mockery on social media, with critics labeling the decision as arrogant, stupid, and greedy. The removal was criticized for eliminating the most successful and widespread audio standard, with many pointing out that wired headphones generally provide better sound quality than wireless options like Bluetooth or Apple's proprietary Lightning connection.\n\nThe decision was seen as a retreat from Apple's previous \"it just works\" philosophy, as users were now required to purchase expensive dongles or rely on inferior wireless solutions. The AirPods, Apple's wireless earbuds, were mentioned as an example of the company's focus on proprietary technology, which prompted jokes about their potential loss and the inconvenience of charging while using headphones.\n\nThe announcement sparked anger among consumers, who felt that Apple was prioritizing profit over practicality and convenience. The comparison was drawn to other eliminations, such as the CD drive and 30-pin connector, but the lack of a universal standard seemed particularly frustrating. The \"space at a premium\" argument was questioned, as the removal affected not only headphones but also other accessories that relied on the 3.5mm jack.\n\nIn summary, the iPhone 7's removal of the headphone jack sparked a backlash, with critics accusing Apple of arrogance, greed, and a disregard for user convenience.

{"pred": "Recent studies based on observations of Mars' atmosphere have revealed significant discoveries about the planet's ancient water history. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a substantial portion of the planet's northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, which reached up to a mile in depth, persisted for millions of years, providing a warm and wet environment that could have supported the potential for life.\n\nThe water on Mars was initially abundant, with a global ocean that extended up to 137 meters deep. The isotopic analysis of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere indicates a high concentration of deuterium, suggesting extensive water loss over time. This loss, primarily due to the thinning Martian atmosphere, led to the formation of a global ocean that eventually froze and retreated, leaving behind the planet's current polar ice caps.\n\nThe presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere, although not necessarily indicating life, raises questions about the possibility of past habitability. Researchers like John Bridges and James Kasting emphasize that Mars was likely more conducive to life in its distant past, withstanding for longer periods than previously thought.\n\nWhile the exact extent of the ancient ocean may have been underestimated, the accumulating evidence points to Mars being a more habitable environment in its early days. As research continues, the search for signs of life, both past and present, on Mars gains momentum, with upcoming missions like the Exomars rover set to explore these tantalizing findings further.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

While the exact dinosaur sounds remain speculative, the study suggests that they might have communicated in ways similar to large-bodied birds, such as cooing or throaty grunts.\n\nThe film industry, however, has contributed to the popular perception of dinosaur sounds.

The probability distribution is updated as new information emerges, favoring areas closer to the probable location given the suspected cause of the disappearance, which is now believed to be more likely due to a deliberate act.\n\nStatistical tools, like those employed in the 2011 Air France search, involve considering multiple scenarios simultaneously, adjusting for uncertainties, and combining conflicting information. However, the challenge lies in quantifying subjective judgment and accounting for the limited data available, as well as the complexity of the search area, which includes the possibility of the plane being diverted or deliberately hidden.\n\nWhile Bayesian methods were instrumental in locating the wreckage of Air France Flight 447, experts differ on their applicability to the current search. Some argue that the search for MH370's wreckage may be complicated by the vastness of the search area and the lack of definitive clues, making it difficult to rule out certain locations definitively.

{"pred": "On January 31, 2018, history will witness a rare celestial event, a Super Blue Blood Moon total eclipse. This eclipse is unique due to the combination of a Supermoon (when the moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it appear 14% larger and 30% brighter) and a Blue Moon (the second full moon in a month). The event will be visible from various locations, including Australia, western USA, and parts of Asia, with the moon turning red during the eclipse due to the Earth's atmosphere bending the sunlight.\n\nA team of astrophotographers, led by the Virtual Telescope Project, will be capturing the eclipse, including participants from Australia, the United States, and Italy. They will also showcase the Supermoon rising above Rome and other iconic landmarks, providing a global audience with a virtual experience. The project aims to raise funds for The Virtual Telescope Project through donations, offering exclusive content to supporters.\n\nThe last total eclipse of a Blue Moon occurred in 1866, and this event is a highly anticipated spectacle, with a visibility period stretching from central Asia to western North America. For those unable to observe it live, virtual options are available through livestreams from places like the Virtual Telescope Project.\n\nIn addition to the lunar eclipse, the month of January will see three consecutive supermoons, with the final one on January 31 being particularly noteworthy due to the eclipse. Viewers should plan to catch the moonrise for optimal viewing, as it will appear larger and brighter against the horizon.\n\nOverall, this series of celestial events promises to be a spectacular alignment of astronomical wonders, attracting both amateur astronomers and casual observers alike.", "answers": ["Look up at the sky on Jan. 31 and you may witness a sight unseen for 150 years. For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.

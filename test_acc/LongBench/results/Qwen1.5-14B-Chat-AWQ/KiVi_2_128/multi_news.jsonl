A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine revealed that MRSA becomes more virulent and resistant to antibiotics when exposed to cigarette smoke. The smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it more resistant to immune defenses such as reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides. The bacteria can adhere better to human cells, facilitating their invasion. Similar findings were observed with e-cigarette smoke, although cigarette smoke had a more pronounced impact on resistance.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist, showed that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke takes longer to be killed by macrophages, the body's immune cells. The resistance persisted even after the smoke exposure, indicating a potential long-term impact. The research suggests that smoking not only poses health risks to smokers but also aids pathogens in their survival and ability to cause infections.\n\nIn another study, conducted by the same team, the effects were compared between cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor.

The CDC has observed a sharp increase in cases since April, with the peak usually occurring in August and December.\n\nAFM, which has no known cure, has puzzled health officials due to its unclear cause. While it was initially linked to the 2014 outbreak of EV-D68, a surge in cases this year has raised concerns, though no definitive link has been established. The condition is believed to be associated with viral infections, particularly enteroviruses, which can lead to respiratory illnesses but can also cause severe neurological complications.\n\nThe number of cases in 2016 is double that of the previous year, with reports from various states indicating a potential resurgence. While the CDC is investigating the rise, they note that increased reporting could be a factor, and no specific treatment has shown significant improvement in outcomes. The condition is particularly concerning because it can lead to long-term paralysis, with recovery rates often improving minimally over time.\n\nIn 2014, the CDC tracked 120 cases, mostly in children, and the condition was linked to EV-D68, though no definitive connection has been proven. The CDC is urging vigilance and maintaining surveillance, while researchers are exploring potential treatments, such as IVIG, which has shown some promise in animal studies.\n\nAffected families, like the Roberts and Andersen households, express frustration over the lack of understanding and a cure for the mysterious illness. The condition affects not only children but also adults, highlighting the need for further research and awareness.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, health officials advise maintaining good hygiene to prevent potential spread, but the root cause and long-term solutions remain uncertain.

Using live subjects and mannequins, they tested various positions and blood flow scenarios, finding inconsistencies with the patterns supposedly created by a crucifixion victim.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, reveals that the bloodstains on the Shroud do not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion victim. For instance, blood trickles on the shroud do not align with the angles expected from a hanging or crucified position, suggesting a standing model was used to create the imprints. The researchers observed discrepancies in the blood flow, particularly in the spear wound, hand positions, and back stains, which do not match the standard blood flow patterns of a crucifixion victim.\n\nWhile the shroud's radiocarbon dating places it within a medieval timeframe, the forensic analysis questions its historical significance. The investigation adds to the ongoing debate about the shroud's authenticity, with some experts suggesting it may be a 14th-century artistic representation rather than a genuine relic.

Rowling, inspired by a harrowing photograph of a caged child, founded Lumos, an organization dedicated to ending the global practice of institutionalizing children. The majority of these children are separated from their families due to poverty, lack of resources, or disabilities, rather than being orphans. The United Nations and other international actors are increasingly recognizing the damaging effects of institutional care, which can lead to severe emotional, physical, and cognitive harm, particularly for infants and those with special needs.\n\nLumos' work focuses on advocating for alternative care models such as family-based solutions, inclusive education, and support services for families. Their efforts have shown significant progress in countries like Moldova, where a 70% reduction in institutionalized children has been observed since 2007, and in the Czech Republic, where a decrease in admissions and increase in foster care have been achieved. The European Union and other donors are contributing to this global movement by promoting the eradication of institutionalization by 2050.\n\nThe #Letstalklumos campaign, launched by Rowling, aims to raise awareness about the plight of these children and encourage the shift towards supporting families and minimizing the use of institutions. By investing in education, health care, and community-based care, the long-term goal is to create a world where children grow up in loving homes and away from the damaging effects of institutionalization.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer.

The memo is said to reveal concerns about the FBI's use of classified information and potential misrepresentation of facts, including the role of Christopher Steele's dossier and the involvement of political entities like the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the FBI.\n\nThe memo discusses the FBI's surveillance of Carter Page under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), with the initial warrant obtained in October 2016. It criticizes the application for not disclosing the DNC's and Clinton campaign's role in funding Steele's work, the omission of his political ties, and the reliance on uncorroborated information from Steele's dossier.

This dinosaur, with rainbow-colored feathers, is believed to be the first dinosaur with asymmetrical feathers, suggesting the potential for feather steering in birds. Caihong had a mix of dinosaurian and bird-like features, such as a Velociraptor-like skull, dinosaurian body but bird-like feathers, and a crested head with iridescent feathers that resembled those of hummingbirds. The dinosaur's feathers, particularly on its head, neck, and chest, displayed microscopic structures resembling iridescent melanosomes, indicating vibrant colors. The dinosaur's feathers were not only colorful but also contributed to its probable display of social or sexual prowess, possibly through aerodynamic displays.\n\nUnlike previous discoveries, Caihong's feathers were not evenly distributed, with iridescent feathers restricted to specific regions like the head, neck, and possibly the tail. The presence of asymmetrical feathers on the tail suggests a frond-shaped tail, reminiscent of the avialae, a group of dinosaurs that eventually evolved into birds. The dinosaur's feathers, with their unique nanostructures, indicate a diverse palette of colors, possibly suggesting a more colorful world than previously thought.\n\nThe presence of a large crest on its head and the possible function of its feathers in flight, despite its dinosaurian body structure, adds complexity to understanding the evolution of feather usage. The discovery of Caihong challenges our knowledge of dinosaur plumage and provides insights into the diversity of colors and display mechanisms in early feathered dinosaurs.\n\nThe study also highlights the potential for multiple instances of alula-like feathers, which are typically associated with bird-like dinosaurs, hinting at independent evolution of this feature. The preservation of melanosomes in Caihong's feathers allowed scientists to infer the dinosaur's vibrant colors, suggesting a rich tapestry of iridescence, a trait that could have played a role in communication and display.\n\nOverall, Caihong juji's discovery pushes the boundaries of our understanding of dinosaurian diversity and the origins of avian traits, providing a vivid snapshot of a colorful and potentially complex dinosaur world.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Seattle's tax led to price hikes, with a case of Gatorade increasing by over 64% due to the tax. The tax exempted beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, prompting businesses like Costco to display price differences, causing a spike in suburban sales. Seattle's tax also sparked public backlash, with opponents including businesses, labor unions, and even former Mayor Ed Murray, who resigned amidst controversy.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a soda tax was repealed within two months due to public uproar, highlighting the difficulty in implementing such policies. Seattle's tax led to a spike in suburban sales and a decrease in city sales, while critics called for consistency in applying the tax and questioned the fairness of burdening low-income families.\n\nSeattle's mayor and businesses, like Costco, have had to adjust pricing strategies, with some retailers informing customers of alternatives outside the city. The tax's unintended consequences and lack of positive health outcomes have led to calls for clearer messaging and alternative revenue-generating methods.\n\nSimilar to Chicago, Seattle's tax faced legal battles and opposition from various groups, including the beverage industry, which spent millions opposing it. The tax's lack of success in achieving its health goals and the potential for regressive effects on low-income households prompted concerns about the policy's effectiveness and fairness.\n\nOverall, the introduction of soda taxes in Seattle and elsewhere has proven challenging, with mixed results and widespread dissatisfaction. The debate continues over the role of government intervention in consumer choices and the potential unintended consequences for businesses and the community.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

However, Cohen denied that it was a major shake-up, insisting that the campaign was merely responding to changing circumstances.\n\nDuring the CNN interview, Cohen's response to poll numbers was met with incredulity from anchor Brianna Keilar, who pointed out that multiple polls showed Trump trailing Hillary Clinton. Despite the campaign's internal disagreements, Cohen maintained that Trump's team was not yet ready for Conway's hiring but believed it was a step in the right direction. The incident sparked a humorous exchange on social media, with the hashtag #SaysWho trending as users playfully repeated Cohen's query.\n\nIn conclusion, the news passages highlight a period of uncertainty and debate within Trump's campaign, with Cohen defending the changes while acknowledging the need to address public perception.

Mike Brown, often referred to as the \"Pluto Killer\" due to his role in Pluto's demotion from planetary status, has shifted his focus to the discovery of a potential ninth planet. Based on mathematical models and analysis of the orbits of distant dwarf planets and other small objects, Brown and his colleague Konstantin Batygin argue that there is strong evidence for a massive planet, which they call \"Planet Nine,\" located at the edge of the solar system.\n\nThis unseen planet, estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth, is inferred from the gravitational influence it exerts on the orbits of distant objects. While Pluto's demotion from planet status in 2006 was due to its size and the newly defined criteria for planet classification, the discovery of Planet Nine could potentially rewrite the solar system's history. The existence of this ninth planet, if confirmed, would be a significant find, as it would provide crucial insights into the formation and dynamics of the solar system.\n\nBrown and Batygin's research relies on mathematical models and computer simulations, rather than direct observation, as the planet remains unseen.

The site, found by chance when an archaeologist needed a toilet break, holds significance for its age and the evidence it provides about human settlement in the region. The rock shelter, with a blackened roof indicating controlled fires, contained sophisticated tools, bone fragments from a large extinct marsupial (Diprotodon optatum), and evidence of human interaction with megafauna. This pushes back the timeline of human presence in Australia, suggesting a possible colonization earlier than previously believed, possibly as early as 49,000 to 46,000 years ago. The site also marks the oldest known use of ochre in Australia and the presence of early technological advancements like stone axes and bone tools. The discovery challenges the conventional wisdom about the timing of human settlement in the arid regions, with some experts suggesting favorable climatic conditions allowed for rapid expansion. The site, dated to around 45,000 to 49,000 years ago, also hints at interactions between humans and megafauna, potentially influencing the debate over the extinction of megafauna. The findings have been published in the prestigious journal Nature, contributing to a reevaluation of Australia's prehistory and the sophistication of early human cultures.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

In 1967, the Detroit riots and the Algiers Motel incident, where three young Black men were killed by white police officers, are brought to light in a recent film by director Kathryn Bigelow. The movie, \"Detroit,\" directed by Bigelow and co-written with Mark Boal, explores the systemic racism and police violence during the height of the riots, which left 43 dead and thousands injured. The film highlights the stark contrast between the official exoneration of the police and the lingering consequences of racial inequality and police brutality.\n\nThe film, set against the backdrop of the Detroit riots, follows various characters, including a young R&B singer, Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega), and the white security guard (Boyd Holbrook), who finds himself caught up in the chaos. While some officers display horror at the acts they witness, others, like the central antagonist, patrolman Will Poulter's character, perpetuate racism and violence. The film's focus is not solely on character development but rather on the situational narrative, with the Algiers Motel incident serving as a microcosm of the broader social unrest.\n\nThe Algiers Motel incident, which remains unsolved, is a testament to the ongoing struggle for justice and the persistence of racial tensions. The movie's unflinching portrayal of police brutality and the treatment of black citizens during that time echoes current societal issues, highlighting the enduring relevance of the story.\n\nIn addition to \"Detroit,\" the news passages also discuss other works by Kathryn Bigelow, such as \"Strange Days\" and \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" showcasing her ability to tackle sensitive topics. \"Detroit\" is a powerful and intense film, leaving audiences with a sense of unease and anger, reflecting the film's intention to provoke a response from viewers. The film's rawness and lack of sugarcoating have led to mixed reactions, with some critics finding it a soul-crushing and historically accurate account, while others argue it lacks sufficient character development and reflection.\n\nOverall, these news passages paint a vivid picture of a director who confronts uncomfortable truths and the lasting impact of police brutality and racial tensions in America, as depicted in the film \"Detroit\" and her previous works. The movie's intensity and historical context serve as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for equality and the need for accountability in the face of past injustices.", "answers": ["Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit tells the story of a black singer who takes refuge in a dingy motel to escape the 1967 Motor City riots.

Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev's three-step plan for galactic expansion proposes civilizations progress through three stages: Type I (planet-bound), Type II (star-bound), and Type III (galaxy-bound). The recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, revisits Kardashev's model, emphasizing the importance of energy harvesting for long-term survival and resource acquisition.\n\nAs civilizations advance, they face the challenge of dark energy's accelerating expansion, which threatens to make distant stars unattainable due to the cosmic horizon. To counter this, advanced civilizations, like those potentially at Type II or III, would seek to capture energy from nearby stars by constructing Dyson spheres or other structures, such as solar-powered satellites (statites) forming a cloud around the star to harness its energy. This would ensure their continued growth and access to resources.\n\nOlaf Stapledon's science fiction and physicist Freeman Dyson's proposals have inspired discussions on energy-harvesting megastructures, like Dyson spheres, which could indicate the presence of highly evolved civilizations. These structures, like the envisioned ring-shaped structures or rings of statites, would be signs of civilizations capable of capturing stars' energy before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe.\n\nWhile humanity is currently at a relatively early stage, estimated around Type I, the possibility of encountering civilizations that have surpassed these milestones looms. The search for such civilizations involves looking for unusual light signatures, such as galaxies with harvested stars or Dyson spheres, which could reveal the presence of alien technology and resourcefulness.\n\nIn summary, the quest for dominance in the universe involves a race against time, as civilizations strive to secure energy from stars before they become inaccessible due to the expanding cosmos. Advanced technologies like Dyson spheres and energy harvesting techniques are key elements in this cosmic arms race, shaping the future of interstellar expansion and the search for intelligent life.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Stewart, determined to make the show more purposeful and less focused on trivial targets, clashed with the writers, particularly during a \"fuck-you meeting\" and a controversial \"fuck-you\" episode. Key hires like Ben Karlin, a fellow comedian and writer, brought a fresh perspective, pushing for a shift towards political satire and targeting politicians and media. The show's format evolved from a lighter, pop culture-focused approach to a more pointed, satirical one, exemplified by Steve Carell's memorable performance and Jon Stewart's emphasis on deconstructing news and focusing on the process behind the scenes.\n\nDuring the 2000 campaign season, The Daily Show, with Stewart at the helm, gained traction by criticizing politicians and the media, setting a new tone with a field piece questioning John McCain, which marked a turning point in the show's direction.

{"pred": "A series of recent discoveries in East Africa challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors. Researchers, as reported in three papers published in Science, suggest that dramatic climate shifts during the Middle Stone Age, around 320,000 years ago, may have driven significant advancements in toolmaking and social interactions among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. The excavated tools, including sharp obsidian spearpoints and Middle Stone Age tools, indicate a shift from simple, regional stone tools to more specialized instruments crafted from faraway resources like obsidian.\n\nThese innovations, such as the use of obsidian and the development of standardized Middle Stone Age tools, suggest increased mobility, foraging over larger areas, and potentially long-distance trade. The Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, where the oldest of these tools were found, experienced recurrent climate fluctuations, which forced early humans to adapt by altering their toolkits and expanding their social networks. The appearance of obsidian tools, often attached to handles, implies the existence of trading networks among different hominin populations.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether Homo sapiens or a related species created these tools, the evidence points to a gradual transition from simpler tools to the more complex Middle Stone Age designs. The timing aligns with the emergence of Homo sapiens and the proposed rise of social networking as a key factor in their adaptation and success. Climate fluctuations, like those observed in the Olorgesailie region, were likely catalysts for behavioral changes, enabling early humans to develop strategies for resource acquisition and survival.\n\nThe discoveries also challenge the traditional view of a single \"human revolution\" around 40,000 years ago, as the new findings push back the timeline of technological and cultural advancements. Archaeologists argue that the Middle Stone Age tools and the exchange of resources, like obsidian, indicate a level of sophistication that was previously attributed to later stages of human evolution. However, the connection between these developments and the rise of modern behaviors in Homo sapiens remains speculative, as the evidence from Africa suggests a gradual progression of complex behaviors over time, rather than a sudden revolution.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

However, the decision was met with widespread criticism, with many comparing it to arrogance, stupidity, and greed. Critics argued that removing the headphone jack led to inconvenience, as users would need to purchase expensive proprietary accessories like the $9 aux-to-Lightning cable dongles or the $159 AirPods, which were deemed impractical due to their lack of standard compatibility and potential for loss. The elimination of the headphone jack was seen as a move away from Apple's former \"it just works\" philosophy, as the removal affected devices that traditionally plugged into the jack, such as credit card readers and other sensors. The decision was met with ridicule, with some jokingly referring to the lack of the jack as a sign of either courage (Schiller's term) or stupidity. The introduction of the AirPods, which required an iCloud account for connection, further fueled the debate, as users questioned the usefulness and cost of the new technology. The move was criticized for its lack of practicality and the perceived disregard for the convenience of users.

The raid was part of an enforcement of the Lacey Act, a law that extends protection to endangered plants, including the ban on imports of certain hardwoods like ebony due to concerns over illegal harvesting. Gibson, led by CEO Henry Juszkiewicz, maintains its innocence, stating that it believed it was sourcing legally, despite the government's claims that emails and seized documents suggested the company knew about potential illegal practices. The Environmental Investigation Agency's Andrea Johnson argues that the Lacey Act requires end-users to verify the legality of their supply chain, and Gibson was reportedly aware of the risks associated with sourcing from Madagascar, where a ban on exports existed. Some in the guitar industry, like Chris Martin of C.F. Martin Guitar, faced challenges due to the law's retroactivity, as it could potentially affect the provenance of older guitars and the trade of vintage instruments. The situation has raised concerns among guitar makers and dealers about the burden of proving the legality of wood sourcing, especially for those with imported parts from decades ago.

The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

{"pred": "Recent research findings shed new light on the water history of Mars, revealing a previously unseen level of water coverage on the planet. A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once covered a significant portion of the Martian northern hemisphere, similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. This ancient ocean, up to a mile deep in some areas, existed during the planet's early days, providing a warm and wet environment. The ocean persisted for millions of years, with water covering about half of Mars' surface, potentially supporting the possibility of life.\n\nThe study, conducted by NASA scientists using infrared telescopes, discovered that Mars had a substantial amount of water, with a global ocean that extended to a depth of 137 meters. The water loss, primarily due to the thinning Martian atmosphere, led to the depletion of water, leaving behind a heavily deuterium-enriched ice layer, indicating extensive water loss over billions of years.\n\nThe presence of an ocean suggests Mars was more habitable than previously thought, with conditions that could have allowed for the evolution of life. Researchers like John Bridges and Charles Cockell emphasize the potential for life, although it remains uncertain whether life actually emerged. Mars' past wetter climate raises the likelihood of past habitability, with the upcoming Exomars rover mission set to further investigate for signs of life.\n\nWhile the debate continues over the exact extent of water and its implications for life, the accumulating evidence paints Mars as a more Earth-like environment in its ancient past, strengthening the case for searching for traces of past or present microbial life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "In a recent legal development, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) dismissed appeals by both Nestlé and Mondelez, the makers of Kit Kat and Cadbury, respectively, regarding the shape of the iconic four-fingered chocolate bar. Nestlé had been attempting to trademark the shape of its Kit Kat bars in Europe, claiming it was distinctive enough to be protected. However, the court ruled that the shape alone does not confer sufficient distinctiveness for a trademark, requiring evidence of recognition across all EU member states, not just a significant part. This decision annuls Nestlé's appeal and sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), potentially leading to the removal of the Kit Kat shape's trademark protection in the European Union.\n\nThe Kit Kat shape has been a point of contention for decades, with Mondelez, which owns brands like Cadbury, opposing Nestlé's claims. The saga has also involved other chocolate manufacturers, such as Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which has a similar four-fingered design. The ruling implies that a product's shape must be distinctive in every EU market for it to be trademarkable, challenging Nestlé's assertion that the Kit Kat shape is distinctive enough.\n\nWhile the decision temporarily weakens Nestlé's position, the company may still pursue further evidence to support its claim. Meanwhile, the case highlights the ongoing importance of trademark laws in protecting brand identities and shapes, with other disputes like the purple color of Cadbury's Dairy Milk and the shape of Toblerone also being subject to legal scrutiny. The Kit Kat shape trademark battle has attracted attention due to its potential impact on the broader context of EU trademark regulations and the role of EU courts in defining the boundaries of distinctiveness.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

A study published in the journal Evolution reveals that the T. rex's vocalizations might have resembled those of birds, particularly large-bodied dinosaurs like ostriches or doves, emitting low-frequency, throaty sounds similar to cooing or muffled grunts. The study, based on analysis of living and extinct animals, including birds and crocodiles, found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are common in birds with large bodies, could have evolved independently multiple times in ancient reptiles.\n\nThe sounds in the 1993 film \"Jurassic Park\" were created using a variety of animal sounds, such as baby elephants, baby geese, and even a tortoise's mating call. Velociraptors' vocalizations were influenced by goose sounds, with the raptors' calls resembling a goose's hiss. The T. rex's roar, famously heard in the film, was a cinematic invention, combining elements from various sources.\n\nThe study highlights the lack of knowledge about dinosaur vocalizations due to the scarcity of fossil evidence for vocal organs. Scientists speculate that dinosaurs might have communicated with throat-puffed, bird-like sounds, possibly resembling the cooing of ostriches or cassowaries. The discovery of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds suggests that this could have been a plausible dinosaur trait.\n\nThe research underscores the mystery surrounding dinosaur vocalizations, with only a fraction of dinosaur species studied, leaving room for future discoveries.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

{"pred": "The news passages discuss the application of Bayesian statistics in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014. Bayesian statisticians play a crucial role in refining search efforts by updating probabilities based on available data. These statisticians, like those who worked on the Air France Flight 447 case, use a systematic approach to analyze factors such as flight path, wind patterns, ocean currents, and previous search areas to create a probability distribution. Bayesian methods help in assessing the likelihood of the plane being in a specific location, considering the probability of accidents, deliberate acts, and the probability of the plane being intact or damaged.\n\nAs the search for Flight 370 continues, the focus has shifted from an initial assumption of an accident to a higher likelihood of a deliberate act, which influences the search area. Bayesian calculations help refine the search, even when faced with conflicting or incomplete information. However, the challenge lies in quantifying subjective judgment and accounting for the probability of the plane being in a particular location given new evidence.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian techniques were instrumental in narrowing down the search after initial searches were inconclusive. The search for Flight 370 faces similar complexities, with experts estimating probabilities based on historical data, sensor performance, and the probability of wreckage surviving various scenarios. The search for debris might not necessarily lead to locating the entire plane, as the searchers must consider the likelihood of the wreckage being spread across vast areas, potentially requiring multiple iterations of Bayesian updates.\n\nWhile Bayesian methods have been successfully employed in past searches, there is ongoing debate about their suitability in the face of rapidly changing circumstances and limited historical data. Some statisticians argue that Bayesian techniques are valuable due to their adaptability, while others express concerns about the limitations of relying solely on quantitative analysis.\n\nIn conclusion, the application of Bayesian statistics in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 highlights the importance of statistical methods in refining search strategies and updating probabilities as new information emerges. However, the search for the plane remains challenging due to the vastness of the search area and the uncertainty surrounding the cause of the disappearance.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

Egeland told police he'd been attacked after stopping to assist a pregnant driver, but investigators got suspicious when his pricey BMW, his wallet, and his cellphone weren't taken, the Idaho Statesman reports. Then they learned about his recent insurance, and the whole thing unravelled. Now Egeland is facing an extra 3 years and 10 months for his roadside scheme and had his leg amputated from the shotgun blast. Bradford called him a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist,\" the Oregonian reports, but Egeland—who is now on three medications for mental health—has cast his own judgment. \"What bothers me the most is my son—the pain is on him,'' he says. \"If I could take it all back, I would, but I can't.

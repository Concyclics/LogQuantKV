Additionally, the study showed that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was more likely to successfully invade human cells and cause infections in mice, with a significant difference in mortality rates between smoke-exposed and non-exposed MRSA.\n\nThe study also found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA became more resistant to antibiotics and could survive for longer periods, potentially passing on their enhanced resistance to their offspring. The researchers also observed that cigarette smoke exposure led to an increase in the bacteria's ability to adhere to human cells, further aiding their invasion.\n\nThe findings of this study add to the growing body of evidence that cigarette smoke can have harmful effects on both smokers and non-smokers.

The study found that Linnaeus, who is considered the \"Father of Taxonomy,\" was the most referenced individual, with his work being cited across Wikipedia's various language editions. This was attributed to the fact that Linnaeus's contributions to the scientific community, particularly in the field of taxonomy, resulted in a vast number of Wikipedia pages dedicated to the scientific names he established.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of considering both incoming and outgoing links when determining the influence of a person. By combining these two metrics, the researchers arrived at the 2DRank measure, which ultimately placed Carl Linnaeus at the top of the list.\n\nThis study's findings were somewhat unexpected, as they challenged the conventional wisdom that the most influential figures on Wikipedia would be well-known personalities such as Frank Sinatra, Pope Francis, or even historical figures like Jesus Christ. Instead, the study revealed that Linnaeus's influence on the scientific community, as evidenced by the numerous Wikipedia pages dedicated to the scientific names he established, made him the most referenced individual on Wikipedia.\n\nIn a related effort, a separate study by the same researchers aimed to fix all broken links on the web, with a focus on \"No More 404\" sites. The goal was to ensure that references to archived pages would be preserved, allowing readers to access the original content as it was intended by the page's authors.\n\nIn a different but related study, a team led by Young-Ho Eom sought to determine the most influential thinker in the world. The result of this study was", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person. Second place goes to Michael Jackson, and third to Pope Pius XII. When factoring in all 24 language editions of the online encyclopedia, the team found that Adolf Hitler ranked the most important person, while Michael Jackson was again second and Madonna third, reports the Guardian. \"Our analysis shows that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

The shroud, which dates back to between 1260 and 1390 according to radiocarbon dating, has been analyzed for its authenticity, with some claiming it to be a medieval forgery while others maintain its historical significance.\n\nRecent forensic investigations have shed new light on the shroud, particularly concerning the bloodstain patterns on the cloth. A team of forensic scientists, including Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and organic chemist Luigi Garlaschelli, conducted a series of bloodstain pattern tests on the shroud to determine the consistency of the bloodstains with the poses of a crucified person.\n\nThe researchers used real and synthetic blood samples to replicate the bloodstain patterns on the cloth, testing seven different body parts, including the hands, forearms, chest, and lower back. They compared the bloodstain patterns to the expected patterns of a crucified person, such as a T-shaped or Y-shaped crucifixion.\n\nThe results of the forensic analysis revealed inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns, suggesting that the bloodstains on the shroud do not match the expected patterns of a crucified person.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people. That list was the basis for a story in the North Coast Journal about the high number of missing people in Humboldt County. The newspaper shared the story Thursday on Facebook and asked readers if they recognized any of the missing people. Amy O'Brien did. \"I was like wait a minute, she looks so familiar,\" O'Brien tells the Chronicle. \"I instantly thought of The Bachelor.\" The Journal informed the sheriff's office, which contacted Martinez and removed her from the list. \"MOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don’t get cell service on The Bachelor??,\" Martinez tweeted after learning she was a missing person. The Bachelor started filming in September, and it's unclear if Martinez was still filming when she was reported missing. She tweets \"the scariest thing\" about being a missing person \"is that my efforts to conceal The Worst Drivers License Photo Of All Time have been thwarted\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 4630}

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers in Denmark, suggests that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may be associated with an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and hyperkinetic syndrome (HKD) in children.\n\nThe researchers found that children whose mothers took acetaminophen for 20 weeks or more during pregnancy had a 29% higher risk of being diagnosed with ADHD or HKD compared to those whose mothers did not take the medication. Additionally, children exposed to acetaminophen in the second half of pregnancy had a 37% higher risk of ADHD medication prescription.\n\nHowever, the study's authors emphasize that the findings do not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

The Department of Homeland Security recently sent retailers and financial service companies a secret memo warning that the Target hit appeared to be part of a larger international campaign, the Wall Street Journal reports, an insight gleaned with the help of Dallas cybersecurity firm iSight Partners. Yesterday, iSight released its own report, saying that a virus it's calling KAPTOXA \"has potentially infected a large number of retail information systems\"—and noting that the \"intrusion operators displayed innovation and a high degree of skill,\" particularly in terms of the \"operational sophistication\" of the hack. The Journal shares this feature by way of example: The virus focused on stealing data during the peak hours of 10am and 5pm; the data was housed in a Target server that the hackers later accessed. The virus attacks point-of-sale systems in a way that is \"new to eCrime,\" subverting traditional efforts to protect consumer data, the report warns, according to NBC. Parts of the code, which is impervious to all known antivirus software, have been online since last spring.

The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

Traditionally considered a disease affecting primarily older adults, colorectal cancer is now being diagnosed in patients under the age of 50 at an increasing rate. This shift in demographics has prompted healthcare professionals and researchers to reconsider current screening guidelines and risk assessment strategies.\n\nA comprehensive analysis of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program revealed that one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the U.S. are diagnosed before the age of 50, which is the age at which routine screenings are recommended to begin. This finding suggests that colorectal cancer is not solely a disease of the elderly, as previously believed.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, found that nearly 15% of colorectal cancer patients are diagnosed before the age of 50. These younger patients are more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, with a higher likelihood of having cancer that has spread to lymph nodes or other organs. Despite this, younger patients with colorectal cancer tend to live slightly longer after treatment without a recurrence of cancer, possibly due to more aggressive treatment approaches.\n\nThe reasons behind the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults are not yet fully understood. However, researchers have suggested that environmental factors, such as diet, physical activity, and obesity, may play a role in this trend.\n\nThe findings of this study have significant implications for the medical community, as they call for a reevaluation of current screening guidelines and risk assessment strategies. While the study's authors do not yet recommend changing the screening guidelines, they emphasize the need for heightened awareness and vigilance in identifying and treating colorectal cancer in younger individuals.\n\nIn light of these findings, healthcare professionals are urged to be on the lookout for warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as blood in the stool or changes in bowel habits, in patients under 50.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

The operation, which took six hours, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs, shaping it, and attaching it to his head. The surgery was not only cosmetic but also aimed to boost Kieran's self-esteem and social acceptance.\n\nKieran, born with bilateral microtia, a congenital deformity affecting one in 100,000 births, had struggled with social acceptance and bullying due to his appearance. The surgery, led by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, was a success, with Kieran expressing his delight at seeing his new ears.\n\nThe psychological benefits of the surgery are significant. Kieran's mother, Louise Sorkin, expressed her hope that the surgery would help her son fit in better and avoid bullying. The surgery aims to improve Kieran's confidence and social interactions.\n\nThe procedure is not expected to improve hearing, but Kieran can already hear sounds like the wind and birds tweeting. The surgery is a major step forward for children with microtia, who often face social challenges due to their appearance.\n\nThe surgery is not a cure for microtia, and Kieran will need a follow-up operation in six months to ensure the ears are stable and well-positioned.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

The shroud, which dates back to between 1260 and 1390 according to radiocarbon dating, is kept in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy. It has long been a source of fascination and controversy, with some believing it to be the true burial cloth of Jesus, while others, including the Vatican, regard it as an iconic representation.\n\nRecent forensic investigations have sought to determine the authenticity of the shroud by analyzing the bloodstain patterns on the cloth. A team of researchers, including Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the University of Pavia, conducted a series of bloodstain pattern tests on the shroud. They used real and synthetic blood samples to replicate the bloodstains on the cloth, comparing the results to the bloodstains on the shroud itself.\n\nThe researchers found that the bloodstain patterns on the shroud were inconsistent with the expected patterns of a crucified person. The bloodstains on the shroud did not align with the expected patterns of a crucified person, suggesting that the bloodstains were created by a standing model rather than a crucified person.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

A comprehensive analysis by the University of Michigan, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, reveals that approximately 1 in 7 colorectal cancer patients in the U.S. are diagnosed under the age of 50, a demographic where routine screenings are not typically recommended. This finding, published in the journal Cancer, indicates a significant shift in the age distribution of colorectal cancer patients, with nearly 15% of cases diagnosed in individuals younger than 50.\n\nThe study, which examined data from 1998 to 2011, found that young patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer often present with more advanced disease, including metastasis to lymph nodes and other organs. Despite this, younger patients tend to receive more aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy, and have a slightly longer period without cancer recurrence.\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant, as they challenge the current guidelines for colorectal cancer screening, which typically begin at age 50. The researchers suggest that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults are not yet fully understood, but potential factors such as environmental influences, lifestyle choices, and genetic predispositions may play a role.\n\nThe study's findings have raised questions about the need for altered risk assessment and screening strategies for colorectal cancer in younger individuals. While the researchers acknowledge that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults are not yet clear, they emphasize the importance of being vigilant for symptoms and warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as blood in the stool or unexplained changes in bowel habits.\n\nIn light of these findings, the researchers recommend that healthcare providers maintain a high index of suspicion for colorectal cancer in patients under 50 who present with symptoms such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or a change in bowel habits.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

It's \"daring, sophisticated and unforgettably disturbing.\" And \"in scale, scope and the space it offers for a long-awaited moral reckoning, it's nothing less than monumental.\" \"It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is,\" writes Lindsey Bahr at the AP, calling Detroit \"a well-made and evocative film\" jam-packed with \"stomach-churning horror.\" She argues there could be more nuance and perspective. But \"maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with Detroit is the point.\" Chris Klimek says Detroit is \"maddeningly imperfect but still honorable,\" citing \"lightly fictionalized\" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up \"for maximum outrage.\" This is \"messy work, even when it’s done in good faith,\" he writes at NPR. He applauds John Boyega, previously of The Force Awakens. Radiating a \"Denzel-like calm,\" he shows \"he's a bonafide movie star,\" Klimek writes. Peter Howell's main gripe is that the film \"tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people.\" But Detroit still makes for \"urgent viewing,\" he writes at the Toronto Star. Why? \"The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on,\" when \"a person's skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 3798}

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year.

The researchers found that the Martian water vapor contained a higher concentration of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, compared to Earth's water. This suggests that Mars lost a large amount of its water in the past, with the remaining water being mostly locked up in the polar caps.\n\nThe second study, led by Geronimo Villanueva, used the same data to calculate the amount of water that once covered the Martian surface.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The research, led by Dr. Beate Ritz of the University of California, Los Angeles, suggests that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may be associated with an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and hyperkinetic disorder (HKD) in children.\n\nThe study analyzed data from the Danish National Birth Cohort, which included more than 64,000 children born between 1996 and 2002. Mothers reported on their children's behavior, and the researchers examined the number of ADHD medications prescribed and the incidence of ADHD diagnoses.\n\nThe study found that children exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy had a 29% higher risk of being diagnosed with ADHD and a 37% higher risk of receiving a diagnosis of HKD. However, the study's authors emphasize that the results do not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.\n\nThe accompanying editorial in JAIL Pediatrics highlights the need for caution and further research.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged.

Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The breach, which involved the theft of customer payment card data, was initially reported by Neiman Marcus in a late-week notice after a journalist specializing in computer security, Brian Krebs, brought attention to the issue. Neiman Marcus, which had notified credit card companies about the breach in December, stated it had no connection to the Target breach and had not disclosed the breach to the public until after the holiday season.\n\nThe Target breach, which affected 40 million credit and debit card numbers, was part of a broader international hacking campaign. The breach was caused by malware that was inserted into the stores' point-of-sale systems, effectively scraping transaction data from the memory of the cash register systems. The malware, which has been in use since at least 2009, was found to be a sophisticated piece of software that had been used in various regions, including Eastern Europe and Brazil.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

Traditionally, CRC screening guidelines recommend beginning at age 50, but findings from the University of Michigan suggest that nearly 15% of CRC patients are diagnosed before this age. This shift in age demographics for CRC diagnosis is significant and warrants a reevaluation of current screening guidelines.\n\nThe data, derived from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, reveal that 37,847 out of 258,000 CRC patients were diagnosed before the age of 50. This group of patients often presents with more advanced disease, including metastasis to lymph nodes or other organs, and requires more aggressive treatment approaches, such as surgery and radiation therapy.\n\nDespite the higher likelihood of advanced disease at diagnosis, younger patients have shown slightly better long-term outcomes, living longer without cancer recurrence. This paradoxical finding suggests that the aggressive treatment of younger patients may contribute to their extended survival.\n\nThe reasons for the increase in CRC cases among younger adults are not yet fully understood, but factors such as lifestyle choices and environmental influences may play a role. The medical community is urged to be vigilant for symptoms of CRC in younger patients, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or blood mixed with stool, and to consider a family history of CRC as a potential risk factor.\n\nIn light of these findings, there is a growing call to reassess the age at which CRC screening should begin. While the potential benefits of earlier screening are still under investigation, the trend in CRC cases among younger individuals is a significant public health concern that may necessitate a shift in prevention and screening strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, the medical community must remain alert to the changing landscape of CRC incidence and consider the implications for screening and treatment guidelines.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

{"pred": "In a groundbreaking study, scientists have proposed a three-step process for advanced civilizations to harness energy from their universe, as originally outlined by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. The first step involves harnessing all of a planet's resources, followed by capturing the energy of a star, and finally, expanding to harness energy from other galaxies.\n\nA recent paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations would need to capture and harness energy from stars in distant galaxies before they become inaccessible due to the universe's accelerating expansion. To achieve this, Hooper proposes the construction of a Dyson sphere, a swarm of solar-powered satellites that would surround a star, capturing its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe concept of a Dyson sphere has been a popular idea in science fiction, with authors like Olaf Stapledon and Freeman Dyson exploring the idea in their works. In the realm of science fiction, the \"Star Maker\" novel by Stapledon envisions a galaxy surrounded by a gauze of light traps, while Dyson's work in 1960 proposed the concept of a Dyson sphere.\n\nIn summary, the study of Kardashev's three types of civilizations and the exploration of advanced civilizations' energy harnessing methods provide a fascinating glimpse into the potential future of humanity and our place in the universe.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show. Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them.\" Head writer Ben Karlin: \"I remember seeing it in the editing room.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated.

However, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006 revoked habeas corpus rights for certain non-citizens, including legal residents, labeled as \"enemy combatants.\" This act has been criticized for its potential to infringe on civil liberties and for its application in cases like Guantánamo Bay, where detainees have faced indefinite detention without charge or trial.\n\nIn a separate but related development, the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP) has filed a habeas corpus petition on behalf of two chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, held at a Stony Brook University research facility.

The raids, which took place at Gibson's facilities in Nashville, Tennessee, and Memphis, came after the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) raised concerns about Gibson's sourcing of wood from Madagascar.\n\nThe Lacey Act, an endangered species law, was enforced in this case, targeting the illegal logging and trade of wood. Gibson Guitar Corporation, which had been importing ebony from Madagascar, was accused of knowingly sourcing illegally obtained wood. The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, stated that Gibson had not been charged with any wrongdoing and that the company believed it had complied with all relevant laws. However, the EIA and other environmental groups have raised concerns about the legality of Gibson's wood sourcing practices, claiming that the company had not fully complied with the Lacey Act.\n\nThe EIA's director, Andrea Johnson, argues that the Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain. She claims that Gibson's actions have been in violation of this law. Gibson, however, maintains that all of its wood purchases have been in compliance with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe Lacey Act has been a controversial topic in the guitar-making industry, with some arguing that it is a necessary measure to combat illegal logging and promote responsible sourcing of wood. Others, however, have expressed concerns about the retroactive nature of the law and the potential implications for the guitar-making industry.\n\nIn response to the Lacey Act, some guitar makers, such as C.F. Martin Guitar Company, have ceased importing wood from Madagascar altogether. Others, such as Gibson, have sought to comply with the law by presenting documentation to support the legality of their wood sources.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also raised concerns among vintage guitar dealers, who fear that they may be required to prove the legality of the wood used in their instruments", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

Recent findings have provided compelling evidence that ancient Mars was once a warmer, wetter world, with a global ocean covering up to 137 meters deep, equivalent to a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe first news article discusses the discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars, which was once a mile deep and covered a significant portion of the planet's surface. The evidence for this ocean comes from the analysis of the Martian atmosphere and the chemical composition of the water vapor lingering in the atmosphere. The higher concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere indicates that Mars lost a vast amount of water in the past, leaving behind a higher concentration of deuterium. This suggests that the planet was once covered by a global ocean, which would have been a key factor in the planet's habitability.\n\nThe second article focuses on the evidence of a massive ocean that once covered a fifth of the planet's surface. The researchers used data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to analyze the chemical composition of the Martian atmosphere, revealing a higher concentration of deuterium in the planet's water. This suggests that Mars was once a much wetter planet than it is today.\n\nThe third article discusses the implications of these findings for the possibility of life on Mars.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The defense also contends that the federal death penalty is unconstitutional and that Tsarnaev's case should be handled by a federal court due to the nature of the crime.\n\nThe lawyers for Tsarnaev have cited a recent Supreme Court ruling on the vague definition of a \"crime of violence\" as a basis for their argument, claiming that the majority opinion in the case, which upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty, does not apply to Tsarnaev's case. They argue that the appeals process could take up to 10 years, with the quickest possible timeline being 5 years.\n\nDespite the gravity of the situation, Tsarnaev is not the first to face the federal death penalty. Only three inmates have been executed by the federal government in the past 50 years, with the quickest executions being in 2001 for the Oklahoma City bombing and a triple murder in Texas.\n\nTsarnaev's case is unique in that it is being handled by a federal court, which is less common than state-level death penalty cases. The majority of federal death row inmates have been sentenced by individual states, with Texas, Missouri, and Virginia being the most active in this regard.\n\nIn conclusion, Tsarnaev's fate is uncertain, with his death sentence facing potential reversal through the appeals process.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

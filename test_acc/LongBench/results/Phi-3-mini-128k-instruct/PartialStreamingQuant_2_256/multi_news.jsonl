The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but poverty, lack of education, and discrimination have led families to believe that institutionalization is their only option.\n\nThe practice of institutionalization causes significant harm to children, including physical and psychological damage.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The malware, which is similar to a computer virus, was found to be part of a broader international hacking campaign. The report also mentioned that the malware used in the Target breach was part of a larger trend, with the report noting that malware offers cost and risk advantages over hardware skimming techniques.\n\nThe reports from both Neiman Marcus and Target highlight the growing concern over data breaches in the retail industry. Both companies have faced criticism for their handling of the breaches, with Neiman Marcus being accused of waiting too long to disclose the breach. The reports also mention that the breaches appear to be connected to criminal activity in Eastern Europe, with both companies facing inquiries from state attorneys general.\n\nIn conclusion, the news reports reveal the seriousness of the data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target, with both companies facing criticism for their handling of the incidents. The reports also shed light on the sophisticated nature of the attacks, with malware being used to steal credit card information from both companies. The reports also suggest that the breaches may be part of a larger international hacking campaign, with malware being used in multiple breaches across the retail industry.", "answers": ["It looks like the hackers that hit Target had lots of other, well, targets.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

A significant finding from a study led by Dr. Samantha Hendren of the University of Michigan revealed that nearly one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the U.S. are diagnosed before the age of 50, which is the current recommended age for routine screenings. This suggests that colorectal cancer is not solely a disease of the elderly, as previously thought.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data from 1998 to 2011, found that 37,847 out of 258,000 colorectal cancer patients were under 50. These younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, with a higher likelihood of having cancer that had spread to lymph nodes or other organs. Despite this, they lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence, possibly due to more aggressive treatment approaches.\n\nThe findings have raised questions about the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for colorectal cancer in younger individuals. While the study did not establish a clear cause for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults, it is clear that the number of young colorectal cancer patients is rising.\n\nThe reasons for this increase are not yet fully understood, but factors such as smoking, obesity, and a poor diet may contribute. The study also noted that individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer or those at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50.\n\nThe findings have prompted calls for a reevaluation of current screening guidelines and a more aggressive approach to identifying and treating colorectal cancer in younger individuals. However, the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a change are still being debated, and further research is needed to determine the most effective screening strategies for this population.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent study findings have shed light on the need for improved colorectal cancer screening and risk assessment strategies for younger individuals.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

{"pred": "In a groundbreaking study, astrophysicist Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations, such as those hypothetically described by Kardashev and Dyson, would harness the energy of their stars to power their civilizations. This would involve capturing and utilizing the energy of stars, potentially even relocating them to maximize energy extraction.\n\nThe study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, proposes that advanced civilizations would create massive spherical structures, known as Dyson spheres, to capture and harness the energy of their stars. These structures would consist of millions of individual satellites, or \"statites,\" that would hover in space around the star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures has been a popular theme in science fiction. In his 1960 paper, physicist Freeman Dyson proposed the idea of a Dyson sphere, a solid shell surrounding a star, to harness its energy. However, Dyson later realized that a more practical approach would be to create a swarm of individual satellites, each collecting solar energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nIn his study, Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations would be able to detect their presence by observing the unique light signatures emitted by their star-harvesting activities. For example, a Type III civilization, which would be harnessing the energy of an entire galaxy, would emit a distinct light signature that could be detected by astronomers.\n\nIn conclusion, the study proposes that advanced civilizations would harness the energy of their stars to power their civilizations, and that their presence could be detected by observing the unique light signatures emitted by their star-harvesting activities. This research has important implications for the search for intelligent extraterrestrial life and the development of future space exploration technologies.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The U.S. Constitution enshrines this right, and the Founding Fathers considered it essential for preserving liberty and justice.\n\nHowever, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006 revoked habeas corpus rights for detainees at Guantánamo Bay and other locations, effectively creating a second-class system of justice for non-citizens labeled as \"unlawful enemy combatants.\" This has led to concerns about the erosion of habeas corpus and the potential for abuse of power by the executive branch.\n\nIn a separate but related development, a New York court granted a chimpanzee named Leo the right to challenge his detention through a writ of habeas corpus, marking a significant legal milestone. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP) filed a habeas corpus petition on behalf of Leo and another chimpanzee, Hercules, arguing that they were being unlawfully detained and should be moved to a sanctuary.

Recent findings have shed light on the Red Planet's watery past, suggesting that it was once a warm and wet world with a global ocean covering up to 137 meters deep, equivalent to a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe evidence for this ancient ocean comes from the analysis of the Martian atmosphere's water vapor. By studying the composition of the atmosphere, scientists have determined that Mars once had a much higher concentration of deuterium, a heavier form of hydrogen, in its water compared to Earth. This suggests that Mars lost a significant amount of its water over time, with the remaining water being left behind in the polar caps and other reservoirs.\n\nThe research team, led by Geronimo Villanueva, used data from the Keck II telescope and NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility to map the Martian atmosphere and determine the concentration of deuterium. They found that the high concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere indicates that the planet lost a vast amount of water in the past.\n\nThe team's calculations suggest that the ancient ocean on Mars covered a significant portion of the planet's surface, with a depth of around 137 meters. This would have created a warm and wet environment, potentially hospitable to life.\n\nThe findings support the idea that Mars was once a more habitable planet than it is today. The evidence of a vast ocean and a warmer, wetter climate suggests that the planet may have been able to support life, although the exact nature of any life that may have existed on Mars remains a mystery.\n\nIn addition to the evidence of a past ocean, recent studies have also suggested that Mars may have had a thicker atmosphere in the past, which could have contributed to a more habitable environment.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Stumpf said he was \"deeply sorry\" for what happened, New Republic reports. But—according to CNBC—he maintained it wasn't a \"scam\"—Warren's word—but a \"way of deepening relationships\" with customers. Warren accused Stumpf of \"gutless leadership\" for passing responsibility for what happened away from himself and other senior executives while blaming \"thousands of $12-an-hour employees who were just trying to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich.\" The employees' cross-selling scheme was at least partially responsible for Wells Fargo stock going up, making Stumpf's shares alone gain $200 million in value.

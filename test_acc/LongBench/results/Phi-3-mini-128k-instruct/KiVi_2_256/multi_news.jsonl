Researchers from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), have discovered that cigarette smoke can make MRSA more resistant to the body's immune system, potentially leading to more severe infections.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, the team found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became more resistant to macrophage-generated reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are crucial for the immune system to combat bacterial infections. The study also revealed that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA were four times more resistant to macrophage killing and became more invasive in mice.\n\nThe researchers also found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA could adhere better to human cells, making it more difficult for the immune system to fight off the infection.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

But sources tell Page Six that Silva isn't giving in, and \"is forcing the matter to litigation.\" The guitar, the one Cobain played during Nirvana's 1993 MTV Unplugged show and also thought to be the last one he played before taking his life, was once insured for $1 million but, per experts, is probably worth several times that now. Back in August, Silva requested $25,000 a month in spousal support and half of any money Frances made during the marriage, and said the couple had no prenup, TMZ reported. A judge has since ordered Frances Cobain to pay Silva $15,000 a month as part of an interim settlement."], "all_classes": null, "length": 810}

The founder of Lumos, J.K.

The organization aims to end the harmful practice of institutionalization by 2050, with the belief that the majority of children in institutions are not orphans but are separated due to poverty, disability, or other reasons.\n\nThe charity's work is based on the understanding that institutionalization causes significant harm to children, including developmental delays, psychological trauma, and a lack of proper care. Lumos's efforts are focused on keeping children within their families and communities, providing them with the necessary support and resources to prevent the need for institutionalization.\n\nLumos has achieved significant successes in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where they have seen a reduction in the number of children in institutions.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The study, led by Dr. Beate Ritz of the University of California, Los Angeles, and published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, suggests that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may be linked to an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and hyperkinetic syndrome (HKD) in children.\n\nThe study analyzed data from the Danish National Birth Cohort, which included more than 64,000 children born between 1996 and 2002. Mothers reported on their children's behavior, and researchers examined the number of ADHD medications prescribed and the incidence of HKD. The study found that children exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy had a 29% higher risk of being diagnosed with ADHD and a 37% higher risk of HKD.\n\nHowever, the study's authors caution that the findings do not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship. The study's findings are based on observational data, and the results do not prove that acetaminophen causes ADHD. The researchers also noted that the study did not account for the dosage of acetaminophen taken, which could be a significant factor in the observed risks.\n\nIn response to these findings, some experts have suggested that pregnant women should avoid taking acetaminophen unless absolutely necessary. However, other experts caution against drawing sweeping conclusions from the study. They argue that ADHD is a complex disorder with a genetic component, and the study's findings do not prove that acetaminophen causes ADHD.\n\nIn the meantime, the FDA has warned that acetaminophen can cause liver damage in high doses, and the Danish Medicines Agency has recommended limiting acetaminophen use during pregnancy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the study's findings suggest a potential link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and ADHD-like behaviors in children, more research is needed to establish a clear cause", "answers": ["The bad news about acetaminophen just keeps on coming: A new study finds that use of the drug during pregnancy is linked to \"ADHD-like behavioral problems\" in children, CNN reports.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

{"pred": "Recent studies and reports have highlighted a concerning trend in the incidence of colorectal cancer among younger individuals, traditionally considered at lower risk for this disease. A significant finding from the University of Michigan, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, reveals that nearly one in seven colorectal cancer patients in the U.S. are diagnosed under the age of 50, a demographic typically not screened for this type of cancer. This shift in age demographics for colorectal cancer diagnoses, which are now more likely to be advanced at the time of diagnosis, has prompted a reevaluation of current screening guidelines.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Cancer, analyzed data from 1998 to 2011, involving over 250,000 colorectal cancer patients. It found that 37,847 patients, or about 15 percent, were diagnosed before the age of 50. These younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, with a higher likelihood of having cancer that had spread to lymph nodes or other organs.\n\nDespite the advanced stage of diagnosis, younger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to receive aggressive treatment, such as surgery and radiation therapy, and live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. However, the study also highlights the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for this age group.\n\nThe study's findings have raised questions about the need for earlier screening guidelines, as the current recommendations may not be sufficient to detect and treat colorectal cancer in younger individuals. The researchers suggest that a change in the current screening guidelines may be necessary to account for the increasing number of colorectal cancer cases among young adults.\n\nThe study also emphasizes the importance of recognizing the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as blood in the stool, rectal bleeding, or changes in bowel habits. Early detection and treatment can significantly improve outcomes for younger patients with colorectal cancer.\n\nIn light of these findings, the medical community is called to action to improve the early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer in younger individuals.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Borch, who had a fear of animals due to her brother's previous encounter with a rabid raccoon, was terrified and disoriented by the attack. She managed to escape the situation by using her bare hands, which was a self-defense move.\n\nAfter the incident, Borch's father retrieved the raccoon, which tested positive for rabies, and her brother and father drove her to Pen Bay Medical Center. She received six shots of the rabies vaccine, and her last injection is scheduled for June 22. Borch, a vegetarian, expressed her relief that she had survived the encounter, but also her fear of the potential consequences of rabies.\n\nThe Hope Animal Control Officer confirmed that the raccoon was rabid, and the Maine CDC reported that the raccoon was the first of many animals in the area to test positive for rabies. The Hope Animal Control Officer also warned the public about the risk of rabies in animals and the importance of avoiding contact with wild animals, especially those showing signs of aggression or unusual behavior. Borch, who had a strong aversion to animals due to her vegetarianism, expressed her newfound fear of raccoons and other wild animals. She emphasized the importance of vaccination and avoiding contact with potentially infected animals.\n\nIn summary, Rachel Borch's harrowing experience with a rabid raccoon highlights the importance of awareness and precaution when encountering wild animals. Her story serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of rabies and the importance of seeking medical attention and vaccination in the event of an animal attack.

{"pred": "Mars, a Warm and Wet World: An Ancient Ocean on Mars\n\nIn a groundbreaking study, scientists have uncovered evidence that billions of years ago, Mars was home to a vast ocean that could have been a potential habitat for life. The research, led by Geronimo Villanueva of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, suggests that an ancient ocean once covered a significant portion of the Martian surface, potentially providing a suitable environment for life to exist.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Science, reveals that the Martian atmosphere contains a higher concentration of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, compared to Earth's water. This difference in isotopic composition indicates that Mars was once much wetter than it is today.\n\nThe researchers determined that the ancient ocean covered at least 137 meters deep, which would have been enough to cover the entire planet evenly. However, the actual ocean depth is likely much greater, as it probably formed in the low-lying northern hemisphere, which was once home to a much deeper body of water.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient ocean is a significant step forward in our understanding of the Red Planet. It suggests that Mars was once a warm and wet world, with the potential to have supported life. While the evidence does not necessarily indicate that life once existed on Mars, it does provide a more complete picture of the planet's history and its potential for habitability.\n\nThe researchers' findings also have implications for future exploration of the Red Planet. The presence of an ancient ocean could have provided a source of water for future human explorers, and the study of the Martian environment could yield valuable insights into the potential for life beyond Earth.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars is a significant milestone in our understanding of the planet's history and its potential for life. While the evidence does not necessarily indicate that life once existed on Mars, it does suggest that the planet was once a warm and wet world, with the potential to have supported life.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events.

The makeup is “inexcusably campy,” and scenes from the original are “recreated in a fashion that seems more Monty Python than unsettling.” But Ty Burr of the Boston Globe had fun. “The movie is by no means good,” he writes, “but it’s surprisingly enjoyable: a misty, moody Saturday-matinee monster-chiller-horror special.”"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3747}

The Marden Henge, which dates back to 2,400 BC, is the largest prehistoric monument in the area, and its recent excavations have revealed a wealth of information about the people who lived in the region.\n\nThe Marden Henge, a massive enclosure measuring 15 hectares, was discovered to be part of a complex of monuments that once stood on the site. The excavation team, led by Dr. Jim Leary from the University of Reading, has been working on the site for the past six weeks. The team has been uncovering a rectangular house, believed to be one of the best-preserved Neolithic dwellings in the UK, which was part of a larger complex of monuments.\n\nThe house, which was built on a terrace overlooking a mound, was part of a larger complex of monuments that included the Hatfield Barrow, a 1,500-year-old barrow that was once 15 meters tall and now only survives as a 15cm ripple in the field. The team has also uncovered a wealth of artifacts, including flint arrowheads, pottery, and copper bracelets.\n\nThe Marden Henge site is also home to a massive ditch and bank enclosure, which is believed to be the largest of its kind in the UK. The site is believed to have been a significant gathering place for feasts and ceremonies, and the discovery of the child's remains has provided valuable insights into the lives of the people who lived in the area.\n\nThe Marden Henge site is part of a larger archaeological project that aims to better understand the people who lived in the Vale of Pewsey during the Neolithic period.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

The first passage emphasizes the need for people to be aware of the different formalities associated with applying for a loan, such as filling out loan forms and sending them to the lender. It also highlights the availability of fast cash loans, which can be obtained through paperless payday loans without a credit check. However, it is important to understand that these loans come with fees and interest, and borrowers should be cautious of predatory lenders. The passage also mentions the potential consequences of not repaying the loan, such as additional fees and interest.\n\nThe passage further discusses the different types of loans available, including payday loans and installment loans. Installment loans are repaid through monthly installments over a longer period of time, while payday loans are typically for shorter terms. It is important to carefully consider the terms and conditions of any loan before accepting it.\n\nThe passage also highlights the importance of planning ahead and saving money to avoid financial worries. It is recommended that individuals save money in advance to cover unexpected expenses, such as medical bills, home renovations, and wedding expenses.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The study, which analyzed data from the Danish National Birth Cohort involving over 64,000 children and their mothers, suggests a potential link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and an increased risk of ADHD-like behaviors in children.\n\nThe researchers found that children whose mothers took acetaminophen for 20 weeks or more during pregnancy had a 37% higher risk of being diagnosed with ADHD. Additionally, the study indicated that children exposed to acetaminophen in utero had a 37% higher risk of being prescribed ADHD medication.\n\nHowever, the study's lead author, Dr. Beate Ritz, emphasized that the results do not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship.

However, the transient nature of power and status is evident in the stories of 50 individuals who have experienced a precipitous fall from grace.\n\nJames Comey, the former Director of the FBI, has been a controversial figure since the 2016 presidential election. Comey's tenure was marked by his public criticism of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, which many believe contributed to Donald Trump's victory. Comey's firing by President Trump in May 2017, less than two years into his term, has been a subject of much speculation. The White House has provided conflicting reasons for his dismissal, with some attributing it to his handling of the Clinton email investigation and others to his criticism of the FBI's investigation into Clinton.\n\nTiger Woods, a celebrated golfer with 14 major wins, has been embroiled in scandal since 2009. His fall from grace in the golf world is paralleled by his personal struggles with substance abuse and a DUI arrest. Woods' story is a reminder that even the most successful individuals are not immune to personal and professional setbacks.\n\nChris Christie, the former Governor of New Jersey, has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the country. Christie's reputation was sullied by the Bridgegate scandal, which involved a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge in 2013. Christie's fall from grace was further cemented by his failed attempt to secure a cabinet position in the Trump administration.\n\nFinally, James Comey, the former Director of the FBI, has been a controversial figure since the 2016 presidential election. Comey's firing by President Trump in May 2017 was a significant event in the Trump administration. Comey's departure from the FBI was attributed to his criticism of the FBI's investigation into Clinton and his failure to inspire confidence in the company's shareholders.\n\nIn conclusion, the stories of these individuals serve as a reminder that power and success are not guarantees of a trouble-free life.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

The research, led by Dr. Sripal Bangalore of NYU Langone Medical Center, followed 9,509 men and women with CAD over an average of 4.7 years.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

This age group represents a significant proportion of colorectal cancer cases, with nearly 15% of all patients diagnosed being under 50.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, found that the younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, with a higher likelihood of the disease having spread to lymph nodes or other organs. Despite this, younger patients with colorectal cancer lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence, likely due to more aggressive treatment approaches, including surgery and radiation therapy.\n\nThe reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer cases among younger adults are not yet fully understood. However, the trend is a wake-up call to the medical community, as it suggests that a relatively large number of colorectal cancers are now being diagnosed in people under 50.\n\nThe study also highlights the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for this age group.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

{"pred": "In a groundbreaking study, astrophysicist Dan Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations, such as those in the distant future, would harness the energy of their stars to power their civilizations. This concept, known as the Kardashev scale, was first proposed by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. Kardashev's scale categorizes civilizations into three types based on their ability to harness energy: Type I civilizations use all available resources on their home planet, Type II civilizations harness all the energy of their star, and Type III civilizations harness the energy of an entire galaxy.\n\nHooper's research suggests that a Type III civilization would capture and harness the energy of stars in other galaxies, effectively becoming a \"Type III\" civilization. This concept is further explored in science fiction, with authors and filmmakers often depicting megastructures like Dyson spheres to capture and harness stellar energy.\n\nIn a recent paper, Freeman Dyson, a theoretical physicist, proposed the idea of a Dyson sphere, a hypothetical megastructure that encompasses a star to capture its energy. However, Dyson spheres would likely be constructed from millions of individual satellites, creating a cloud around the star to harness its energy.\n\nIn a more recent development, astrophysicist Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations would be able to detect their presence by observing the light signatures of other civilizations. For example, a civilization that has harnessed the energy of a star would emit a unique light signature, which could be detected by astronomers.\n\nIn summary, the search for advanced civilizations and their energy harnessing capabilities continues to be a topic of great interest in both scientific research and popular culture. As technology advances, astronomers may one day be able to detect the signatures of advanced civilizations, potentially leading to groundbreaking discoveries in the astrophysics and astrobiology fields.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The law, which received final approval from both houses of Parliament, allows for the possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana to be treated as a petty offense, resulting in a fine rather than a criminal record.\n\nThe new legislation also permits the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. This move is seen as a significant step towards the development of a legal cannabis industry in Jamaica, which has long been associated with the production and use of ganja (marijuana).\n\nThe Jamaican government has expressed that the passage of this legislation does not mean a softening of its stance on transnational drug trafficking or the cultivation of illegal marijuana plots. The country's security forces will continue to enforce the law in line with international treaties.\n\nThe United States has also expressed its support for Jamaica's decision to decriminalize marijuana.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo.

{"pred": "Mars, a planet once considered a cold and dry world, is now understood to have been a warm and wet environment in its early history. Recent studies have revealed that Mars was home to a vast ocean, covering about 137 meters deep, which would have been at least a mile deep if evenly spread across the planet. This ocean, which would have been at least a fifth of the planet's surface, is believed to have been a long-standing body of water, indicating that Mars was at least habitable for a significant period.\n\nThe evidence for this ancient ocean comes from the analysis of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere. The study found that the Martian water vapor is enriched with deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, compared to Earth's water. This enrichment suggests that Mars lost a significant amount of water over time, with the remaining water being locked up in the polar ice caps.\n\nThe high D/H (deuterium to hydrogen) ratio found in the Martian atmosphere indicates that the planet's water has been lost over time. The researchers estimate that the water on Mars has been lost at a rate of about 1.5 centimeters per year. This loss of water has led to a higher concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere, which is seven times higher than that of Earth.\n\nThe Martian ocean, which would have covered a significant portion of the planet's surface, is believed to have been a long-standing body of water. The researchers suggest that the Martian ocean was at least 137 meters deep, which would have been enough to cover a significant portion of the planet's surface.\n\nThe evidence for the ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the possibility of life on the planet. The presence of liquid water for an extended period would have been conducive to the evolution of life. However, the Martian environment may not have been consistently habitable, and it is possible that any life that may have existed on the planet would have been short-lived.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence for the ancient ocean on Mars suggests that the planet was once a warm and wet environment, which could have been habitable for a significant period.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The team, led by Shinji Nishimoto and Jack Gallant, conducted an experiment where subjects watched YouTube videos while inside an MRI machine. The researchers recorded the subjects' brain activity and used it to reconstruct the videos, creating a unique visual representation of the subjects' experiences.\n\nThe study involved subjects watching a series of YouTube videos while their brain activity was monitored. The researchers then used this data to develop a computer model that matched patterns of brain activity with the visual content of the videos. The resulting reconstructions were blurry and dream-like, but they provided a glimpse into the subjects' visual experiences.\n\nThe researchers believe that this technology could eventually be used to reconstruct not only visual experiences but also other mental experiences, such as dreams, memories, and intentions. However, they caution that the technology is still in its early stages and that the potential applications are still being explored.\n\nThe researchers also acknowledge that the technology is not yet advanced enough to accurately reconstruct complex mental experiences, such as memories or intentions.

According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3608}

A source tells UK magazine Look the actor sent Holmes an \"emotional letter\" looking to, at the very least, be friends again, Australia's News Network reports. \"It's like he's finally recognized that Katie will always be the love of his life,\" the source says. Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one.

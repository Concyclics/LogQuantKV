In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

Recent forensic investigations have raised questions about the authenticity of the shroud, suggesting it may be a medieval forgery.\n\nResearchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli conducted a series of bloodstain pattern analyses on the shroud, using both real and synthetic blood samples. Their findings indicated that the bloodstains on the shroud were inconsistent with the positions of a crucified or hanging person. The researchers concluded that the bloodstains appeared to be patched from a standing model, rather than from a bleeding, executed person.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angles at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other, off by as much as 10 degrees. A simulated spear wound in the chest ran in completely different patterns than the one on the shroud, whether standing or prone.\n\nThe researchers' findings have been published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences and have added to the evidence that the Shroud of Turin is a medieval forgery.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The house, made of white chalk plaster, was part of a larger complex that included smaller monuments and was connected to the river Avon.\n\nThe excavation team, led by Dr. Jim Leary from Reading University, has discovered a wealth of artifacts, including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch. Analysis of the seeds and charred grains found at the site will reveal what the people were growing and eating. Pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit suggest that the house was not a permanent residence but was used for feasts and gatherings.\n\nThe team has also uncovered a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton believed to be that of a child. The body was found lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace. Scientific analysis of the skeleton will provide information on the child's gender, diet, pathologies, and date of burial.\n\nMarden Henge, built in 2,400 BC, is the largest prehistoric monument of its kind in the country.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

Dickson Wright, born Clarissa Theresa Philomena Aileen Mary Josephine Agnes Elsie Trilby Louise Esmerelda Dickson Wright on June 24, 1947, in London, was known for her irreverent and eccentric television persona alongside Jennifer Paterson. The show, which debuted in 1996 on the BBC and ran until 1999, featured the pair traveling the UK in a motorcycle-sidecar, cooking and often indulging in high-fat ingredients.\n\nDickson Wright's life was marked by a tumultuous upbringing in an affluent family, where she was the youngest of four children and the daughter of a prominent surgeon and an alcoholic. She became a barrister at 21 but later battled alcoholism, which led her to quit law and pursue cooking. She ran a culinary bookshop and wrote a cooking column before being recruited by television producer Patricia Llewellyn to collaborate on \"Two Fat Ladies.\" The show was a hit, but it also attracted criticism for its indulgent recipes.\n\nDespite her success on television, Dickson Wright was not without controversy. She was a champion of hunting and countryside pursuits, even suggesting that badgers should be eaten following a cull. She also caused a stir with her views on vegetarians and her \"pathological\" dislike of carrots. She was a fiery and outspoken personality, known for her strong opinions and commanding presence on screen.\n\nAfter Paterson's death from lung cancer in 1999, Dickson Wright continued her television career with other shows, including \"Clarissa and the Countryman\" and \"Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.\" She also published a well-received book, \"A History of English Food,\" and served as the Rector of the University of Aberdeen from 199", "answers": ["Both of TV's \"Fat Ladies\" have sung.

However, she also emphasizes that the study does not show a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and ADHD.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate among experts, with some cautioning against drawing definitive conclusions. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist and associate professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, argues that the study's findings do not prove that acetaminophen use during pregnancy causes ADHD. He also points out that ADHD has a strong hereditary component, with 70 to 80% of cases being hereditary.\n\nDespite the ongoing debate, the study's authors recommend that pregnant women avoid taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy, as these factors are associated with higher risks. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Tylenol, acknowledges the study but emphasizes that there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.\n\nIn light of these findings, some experts suggest exploring non-pharmacological alternatives to relieve pain during pregnancy, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture.

Senate Democrats, however, have vowed to reject any changes to the ACA, and President Obama has indicated he would veto such a bill. House Speaker John Boehner, facing pressure from conservative members of his party, has pushed for these changes to show they are fighting against the ACA.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline approach, urging President Obama to cancel a meeting with congressional leaders and warning that a shutdown would be detrimental to the GOP's political standing.

The spacecraft, initially known as the Solar Probe Plus, will attempt to get closer to the sun's surface than any spacecraft before, coming within 4 million miles of it. This mission, costing around $1.5 billion, is set to launch in July or August 2018 and will spend seven years in solar orbit, performing 24 close flybys of the sun.\n\nParker's work on solar wind, initially met with skepticism, has since been proven correct and has been instrumental in shaping the mission's objectives. The Parker Solar Probe will carry a chip with pictures of Parker and his seminal paper on solar wind, as well as a plate with Parker's chosen inscription. The spacecraft will be equipped with a carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, and its solar arrays will retract and extend to keep it at a safe temperature and power it with the sun.\n\nThe mission aims to answer two long-standing questions about the sun: how the solar wind is accelerated and why the sun's corona is so much hotter than its surface. The Parker Solar Probe will also study the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles.\n\nThe mission is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the sun and the origins of physics, shed light on Earth and its place in the solar system, and improve space weather forecasting.

The company has introduced an unlimited maternity and paternity leave policy for new parents, allowing them to take as much time off as they need during the first year after a child's birth or adoption. This policy aims to provide employees with the flexibility and confidence to balance the needs of their growing families without worrying about work or finances.\n\nThe move comes as Netflix continues to foster a \"freedom and responsibility\" culture, giving employees context about the business and the freedom to make their own decisions. The company's Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz, emphasized that the success of Netflix hinges on competing for and retaining the most talented individuals in their field. Experience shows that people perform better at work when they're not worrying about home, and this new policy, combined with the company's unlimited time off policy, allows employees to be supported during the changes in their lives and return to work more focused and dedicated.\n\nNetflix's unlimited leave policy is a landmark perk that sets the company apart from its competitors. The company's decision to extend this policy to fathers, as well as understanding that the entire first year after childbirth can be challenging for new parents, demonstrates its commitment to supporting its workforce.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that unlimited time off policies can have their pitfalls.

Their findings, published in the Astronomical Journal, suggest that Planet Nine could be five to ten times the mass of Earth and about two to four times its diameter, making it the fifth-largest planet after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine is based on mathematical and computer modeling, and the researchers anticipate that it will be confirmed via telescope within five years. The existence of this planet would significantly reconfigure our understanding of the solar system, which currently consists of eight recognized planets. The Caltech astronomers have been searching for Planet Nine for years, and their work has been driven by the desire to understand the origins of the solar system and the journey of discovery.\n\nThe concept of Planet Nine was first proposed by Brown and Batygin in 2014, when they observed a peculiar clustering of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the remote regions of the solar system. They struggled to debunk the idea of a ninth planet but eventually concluded that the best explanation for the clustering was the gravitational effects of a larger, unseen planet.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine would not be the first time a planet has been reclassified. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) demoted Pluto from its status as the ninth planet to that of a dwarf planet, a decision that was controversial and met with significant backlash.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

Another board member noted that he hadn't taken an alcohol-abuse program as he promised he would at his last hearing.

He crafted an extraordinary bulletin titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE,\" which warned of a powerful hurricane with unprecedented strength. The document predicted that most of the area would be uninhabitable for weeks, if not longer, with significant damage to homes, infrastructure, and natural vegetation. It also highlighted the potential for water shortages, exacerbating human suffering.\n\nRicks' forecast was based on his local expertise and personal experience with previous hurricanes, including Betsy and Camille. Despite the dire predictions, Ricks and his fellow forecasters rode out the storm at the National Weather Service office in Slidell. The devastation that followed was clear evidence of the accuracy of Ricks' forecast.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, Ricks returned to work alongside colleagues who had lost their homes and were still wearing the clothes they wore during the hurricane. The bold and effective forecast issued by Ricks has since been displayed in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, along with a rosary from Ricks' grandmother.\n\nThe National Weather Service has since encouraged the use of strong language and personal pleas during weather emergencies, as demonstrated by meteorologist Gary Szatkowski's \"personal plea\" during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

An extensive analysis of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute, covering the period from 1998 to 2011, revealed that approximately 15% of CRC patients were diagnosed before the age of 50. This demographic shift challenges the current screening guidelines, which recommend the initiation of screenings at age 50.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren of the University of Michigan, found that younger patients with CRC were more likely to present with advanced disease, including metastasis to lymph nodes and other organs. Despite this, younger patients tended to receive more aggressive treatment, such as surgery and radiation therapy, and lived slightly longer without cancer recurrence compared to older patients.\n\nThe findings suggest that the medical community needs to reassess risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. The study also raises questions about the potential benefits of starting CRC screenings at an earlier age. However, the authors caution that more research is needed to determine whether altering screening guidelines would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths.\n\nIn addition to the study, other researchers have also observed an increase in CRC rates among younger individuals. A study published in the journal Cancer estimates that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in ten colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50.\n\nThe reasons for the increase in CRC among younger adults are not yet fully understood. However, potential contributing factors may include lifestyle changes, such as increased rates of obesity and physical inactivity, as well as environmental factors.\n\nIn light of these findings, healthcare providers should be vigilant in identifying early warning signs of CRC, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and blood in the stool. Patients with a family history of CRC or other risk factors should consider beginning screenings earlier than age 50.\n\nOverall, the increasing incidence of CRC among younger individuals undersc", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "A groundbreaking archaeological discovery in the Flinders Ranges of southern Australia has unveiled a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, challenging previous beliefs about the timeline of Aboriginal Australians' arrival and their technological advancements. The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, was stumbled upon by Giles Hamm and Clifford Coulthard, an Aboriginal elder, during a casual survey. The discovery of a blackened roof, indicative of human activity, led to the excavation of the site, which yielded over 4,300 objects and 200 bone fragments.\n\nThe findings suggest that Aboriginal Australians, the world's oldest continuous civilization, may have reached the arid interior of Australia much earlier than the previously accepted time frame of 50,000 years ago. The Warratyi site, located about 550 km north of Adelaide, also provides the earliest-known evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum, a giant marsupial, and the remains of a giant bird. This evidence of cohabitation with megafauna is significant in the debate over the extinction of these species and the role humans may have played.\n\nThe excavation methods employed at Warratyi were meticulous, with hand excavation and a 1-m grid system used to ensure precision. Artefacts were carefully recorded and tested for refitting to confirm the integrity of the depositional laminae. Optical dating of quartz grains and radiocarbon dating of burnt eggshells and charcoal fragments provided age estimates for the site, which ranged from 49,000 to 46,000 years ago. Bayesian age modelling integrated the chronological information within a unified statistical framework, resulting in a combined age estimate for the site.\n\nThe artefacts found at Warratyi include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre, and gypsum pigments, indicating the development of key technologies such as bone needles, wood-handled stone tools, and hafted axe technology.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The paper, authored by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, suggests that the only way for a civilization to avoid being left behind by the accelerating expansion of the universe is to capture and harness the energy of stars from other galaxies.\n\nHooper's paper, which has yet to undergo peer review, posits that the presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate, making stars beyond our Local Group unobservable and inaccessible over the course of the universe's age. To prevent this, Hooper argues that any advanced civilization would need to capture stars from other galaxies and harness their energy before they become permanently inaccessible.\n\nTo achieve this, Hooper proposes the construction of \"Dyson spheres,\" massive swarms of solar-powered satellites that would orbit a star and collect its energy. These satellites, called \"statites,\" would hover in space by balancing against the pressure of light from the sun. The energy collected by the statites would then be beamed back to the home planet.\n\nHooper suggests that such advanced civilizations would likely be millions or even thousands of years older than humanity, and that they would be well into their Type III stage of Kardashev's scale, which involves harnessing the resources of an entire galaxy. He also notes that the light signatures of galaxies with harvested stars would peak at longer wavelengths, potentially allowing astronomers to detect these civilizations.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures has been a popular theme in science fiction, with examples appearing in Larry Niven's 1970 novel \"Ringworld\" and the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\" However, Hooper's paper suggests that such structures may not only be a possibility but a necessity for any civilization seeking to avoid being", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Co-creator Lizz Winstead and writer Madeleine Smithberg focused on satirizing pop culture and news conventions. The show's success led to a move to a later time slot and eventually caught the attention of CBS, which offered David Letterman's replacement, Craig Kilborn, a 12:30 A.M. slot.\n\nStewart's tenure as host brought significant changes, including a shift from spoofing news to critiquing the news process itself. The show's creative process involved Stewart, Smithberg, and the writing staff, with Stewart often pushing for a more pointed and intentional approach.\n\nThe Daily Show's success attracted attention from other networks, and Stewart's candidacy for a CBS talk show led to auditions for the Daily Show's host position.

The researchers propose that the back-and-forth shifts between wet and dry conditions around 320,000 years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo sapiens, may have encouraged the formation of trading networks and social networking as a key to early human success.\n\nThe findings also challenge the previous belief that a \"human revolution\" occurred 40,000-50,000 years ago, with modern behaviors such as symbolism and art. Instead, the new evidence points to technological and cultural innovations occurring earlier, in response to long-term environmental and climatic changes. The Olorgesailie Basin's archaeological record reveals a long and tumultuous phase in the region, with repeated cycles of droughts and high rainfall, which likely pushed early humans to adapt and innovate.\n\nThe researchers found that the Middle Stone Age technology was well established in the region, suggesting that human ancestors likely started developing it even earlier. The diversity of stone tools and the presence of exotic materials like bright red ochre pigment indicate advanced thinking, planning, and the ability to produce small, finely-crafted tools for specific purposes. The evidence also suggests that early humans shifted from scavenging to hunting, and that they maintained distant contacts with other groups, exchanging raw materials and possibly food, to", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The law also allows Rastafarians to use marijuana for religious purposes and permits tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad to apply for permits to legally purchase small amounts of ganja.\n\nThe new legislation makes possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana a non-arrestable offense that could result in a fine, rather than a criminal record. Cultivation of five or fewer plants on any premises is also permitted. The law is seen as a significant step in correcting the criminalization of tens of thousands of Jamaicans, mostly poor young black males, for possession of a small amount of ganja. It also addresses the victimization of Rastafarians, who have long used marijuana in their religious practices.\n\nThe move has been hailed as a progressive step towards the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp. Commerce Minister Anthony Hylton has expressed optimism about the potential for Jamaica to become a player in the nascent medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the development of innovative pot-derived products.\n\nDespite the positive reception, the law does not mean that Jamaica plans to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots.

This vast body of water, which could have been as deep as a mile, existed around 4 billion years ago and would have been a promising environment for alien life.\n\nScientists from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the European Southern Observatory used powerful telescopes to study the Martian atmosphere and its water vapor. They found that the planet's water contains a higher proportion of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, compared to Earth's water. This suggests that Mars has lost a significant amount of its water over time.\n\nThe researchers calculated that the ancient ocean could have covered the entire Martian surface to a depth of 137 meters. However, it likely formed in the northern hemisphere, where the terrain is lower. The ocean would have been a long-standing body of water, with evidence suggesting it lasted for millions of years.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient ocean challenges previous beliefs that Mars was a cold and dry planet. It also supports the idea that the planet's early environment could have been hospitable to life. The search for signs of past life on Mars is set to intensify in 2018, with the European Space Agency's ExoMars rover mission aiming to detect chemical signatures of life deep beneath the Martian soil.\n\nIn addition to the ancient ocean, the researchers also found evidence of methane in the Martian atmosphere, which could potentially be a sign of life. However, methane can also be produced through geological processes without the need for life.\n\nOverall, the new findings paint a picture of a once-wet and potentially habitable Mars. While the existence of life on the planet remains uncertain, the possibility of past habitability is becoming increasingly compelling.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

These sounds are produced by pushing air into an esophageal pouch rather than exhaling through an open beak. The study found that closed-mouth vocalization has evolved independently at least 16 times within the archosaur group, which includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe researchers suggest that large-bodied dinosaurs may have had similar vocal abilities to modern birds, with closed-mouth vocalizations being more likely in animals with larger body sizes. However, small-bodied birds, like sparrows and finches, do not typically use closed-mouth vocalizations.\n\nThe study also highlights the challenges of reconstructing dinosaur sounds due to the lack of fossilized vocal organs. Despite this, the researchers believe that closed-mouth behavior may have evolved multiple times in archosaurs, suggesting it could have been incorporated into mating displays.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the sound design for \"Jurassic Park,\" shared his creative process for creating dinosaur noises.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

In a study published in Current Biology, the team successfully reconstructed YouTube videos from the brain activity of study subjects, using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and advanced computer algorithms.\n\nThe experiment involved subjects lying still inside an MRI machine while watching YouTube videos. The MRI recorded the blood flow in the visual cortex, the part of the brain responsible for processing visual information. The researchers then used this data to develop a \"movie reconstruction algorithm\" that matched specific neural patterns to the content of the videos.\n\nThe results were astonishing. The algorithm was able to reconstruct the YouTube videos based on the brain activity of the study subjects, creating a continuous, albeit abstract, representation of the videos. The reconstructed videos were blurry and dream-like, as they layered all the YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity pattern.\n\nThis achievement represents a significant advancement in our understanding of how the brain processes dynamic visual experiences. The researchers believe that this technology could eventually be used to decode internal imagery, such as dreams, memories, and even fantasies.\n\nThe lead author of the study, Shinji Nishimoto, emphasized the importance of understanding how the brain processes visual experiences in naturalistic conditions. The team hopes to build more sophisticated models of the visual system, which would lead to better resolution and more accurate reconstructions.\n\nWhile the potential applications of this technology are vast, the researchers caution that it is still in its early stages.

These methods allow for updating probabilities of finding a target based on new information, such as flight paths, ocean currents, and areas already searched.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009, Bayesian techniques helped locate the wreckage after multiple failed searches. The French aviation accident investigation authority, BEA, called upon Metron Inc, a team of statisticians with expertise in finding objects lost at sea, to assist in the search. Senior analyst Colleen Keller flew to France to work with the team.\n\nThe Metron team used Bayesian principles to assess various crash scenarios and historical data, ultimately narrowing down the search area. They initially assumed the plane would be found within a 40-mile radius of the last known location pinged by the plane's onboard system. However, after no signal was detected from the black box or voice recorder, the team revised their probability estimates, considering the possibility that the devices may not have been emitting signals. This led to a new area of highest probability, which was eventually searched and yielded the wreckage.\n\nThe search for MH370 faces additional challenges, including the vastness of the search area and the possibility of deliberate diversion. New information, such as the shutdown of the plane's communication systems, has lowered the probability of an accidental disappearance and increased the likelihood of a deliberate act.

The fraud was quickly detected, and Egeland was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the mortgage fraud case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Scott Bradford described Egeland as a \"menace to society\" and a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist\" who caused \"unimaginable psychological and emotional destruction\" to his son.

Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later. The couple also sent out invitations last week to a dinner party at their winter home in Palm Beach."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2360}

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "Title: GPS Glitch Leads to Car Suspended from Telephone Pole in Mendon\n\nA car was suspended from a telephone guy wire in Mendon, Massachusetts, after the driver reacted too quickly to a GPS unit's instructions to turn around. The incident occurred around 8 p.m. on Wednesday evening, near the Sugar & Spice Restaurant.\n\nAccording to police, a Toyota Corolla driven by Nabila Altahan left the lane of traffic while westbound on Route 4 in Mendon, when the GPS device suddenly instructed the driver to turn around. Altahan reacted quickly to the directions, leaving the road and causing the car to end up suspended from the guy wire of a telephone pole.\n\nFortunately, Altahan and her passenger were not injured in the incident. A witness at the nearby miniature golf course reported seeing the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended from the pole.\n\nState police and the Rutland City Fire Department responded to the scene. The driver was not cited for any traffic violations, as the incident was deemed an unfortunate accident caused by a GPS glitch.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the reliability of GPS devices and the potential dangers they can pose if drivers react too quickly to sudden directions. It is a reminder for drivers to always exercise caution and remain alert while using GPS systems.\n\nIn response to the incident, GPS manufacturers and developers are working to improve the accuracy and reliability of their devices to prevent similar accidents in the future. Additionally, drivers are advised to always follow traffic rules and regulations, and to never rely solely on GPS devices for navigation.\n\nThe Mendon Police Department has issued a statement reminding drivers to remain vigilant and to use GPS devices as a supplement to, not a replacement for, their own knowledge of the road and traffic laws.\n\nThe incident has also sparked discussions about the need for better driver education and awareness regarding the potential dangers of over-reliance on technology while driving. As technology continues to advance, it is essential for drivers to stay informed and responsible to ensure their safety and the safety of others on the road.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

Silva's lawyer has sent a series of threatening messages to Silva's ex-girlfriend, allegedly to pressure her to return the guitar.\n\nThe situation has reached a stalemate, with Frances Bean's husband, Isaiah Silva, demanding a hefty spousal allowance. Silva is seeking a monthly spousal support of $25,000, a figure he believes is fair and necessary to support the ongoing legal proceedings.\n\nThe guitar, believed to be worth several million dollars, is at the center of the dispute. Silva's side claims the guitar was a gift to him and his wife, and that it was a part of their wedding ceremony. However, Frances Bean Cobain's side denies this claim, stating that the guitar was a gift to her and her family.\n\nThe legal battle over the guitar has now turned into a court case, with Frances Bean's husband, Isaiah Silva, seeking a spousal support order for the guitar.

Frances Bean Cobain was married to Silva for 21 months, and she's been trying to get the Martin D-18E (which had the bridge flipped so Cobain, a leftie, could play it comfortably) back ever since they split in March. Silva claims she gave it to him as a wedding gift and it's rightfully his. Now, the battle is headed to court, Page Six reports. \"It’s not [Silva’s]. It’s a treasured heirloom of the family. It’s not his to take,\" Frances Cobain has said.

Back in August, Silva requested $25,000 a month in spousal support and half of any money Frances made during the marriage, and said the couple had no prenup, TMZ reported.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\" (This female hiker is the \"biggest badass you've never heard of.\")"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2416}

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

Neiman Marcus apologized for the delayed disclosure and stated that it had no knowledge of any connection between the breach and Target's data breach.\n\nThe Target breach affected 40 million credit and debit card accounts, with encrypted PINs for debit cards also stolen. The breach was attributed to a sophisticated cyber attack, with the iSight report suggesting that the attack originated from regions with advanced software capabilities, including Russia and Brazil. The Target breach was a significant event, with the company acknowledging the incident and noting that the breach had a significant impact on the retail industry.\n\nIn a separate report, a 17-page report from a computer firm, iSight, provided insight into the Target breach.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf.

Traditionally, colorectal cancer has been considered a disease primarily affecting the elderly, with screening guidelines recommending the onset of screenings at this age. However, a comprehensive analysis of data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team, reveals that approximately 14 percent of colorectal cancer patients are diagnosed under the age of 50. This age group is more likely to present with advanced-stage cancer, yet they are also more likely to receive aggressive treatments such as surgery and radiation therapy.\n\nThe researchers found that younger patients with colorectal cancer were more likely to have metastasized tumors, and their five-year survival rates were marginally higher than those of older patients (95.1 percent vs. 92 percent). Despite the higher likelihood of more aggressive treatment and advanced disease in younger patients, they still live a slightly longer time without a recurrence of the disease.\n\nThe study's findings suggest the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for patients under 50, as they are at a higher risk of developing coloream cancer. However, the researchers caution that changing screening guidelines may not be cost-effective, and the medical community should remain vigilant in monitoring young patients with potential signs of colorectal cancer, such as unexplained anemia, blood in the stool, or blood in the stool.\n\nThe reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults are not yet clear, but researchers speculate that environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and genetic predisposition may play a role. The researchers emphasize the need for the medical community to prepare for the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors, who will require long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of the disease and its treatment.\n\nIn summary, the study findings indicate a significant increase in colorectal cancer incidence among younger patients, with a higher likelihood of", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Shortly before, he purchased a child's nightgown, bikini, girls' underwear, lipstick, and nail polish at an area Walmart. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has pictures of those items. Carlie's mother Shannon Trent tells People she felt \"sick to my stomach\" when she heard about those purchases. \"I don't know what he's done to her,\" she says. \"I don't think he would hurt her, but if he's capable of kidnapping a child he's capable of anything.\" Authorities believe Carlie is in \"imminent danger.\" Simpson also purchased camping supplies and nonperishable groceries, and authorities think he may be hiding with Carlie in an isolated area. The TBI says there have been rumors online that Simpson is trying to protect Carlie, but it says that couldn't be further from the truth. \"This was not an innocent camping trip, this was a crime,\" a spokesperson tells WATE.

Gibson Guitar CEO Henry Juszkiewicz expressed concern over the company's business being impaired and the company's position being weakened due to the lack of a clear legal stance.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has criticized Gibson for knowingly importing ebony from Madagascar, despite a ban on the export of illegally logged wood. Gibson has denied these allegations, asserting that all wood purchases have been in compliance with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, has been amended to include plants, and the Environmental Investigation Agency supports this law. The Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their wood sources. Gibson's actions have been called into question, with the EIA claiming that Gibson took steps to maintain a supply chain that may have been connected to illegal timber harvesting.\n\nThe Gibson Guitar Corporation has been accused of continuing to purchase wood from Madagascar, despite a ban on ebony importation due to the country's political situation. This has raised concerns among other guitar builders, with Martin stating that the company ceased to buy Madagascar wood after the international community recognized the illegitimacy of the government in the wake of a coup.\n\nThe Gibson Guitar Corporation has been a significant player in the music industry, with some of the world's most famous guitars being manufactured by Gibson.

NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \"It's a nightmare,\" says a dealer. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 1352}

{"pred": "Mars, a planet with a history of water, has been the subject of intense study and speculation. Recent findings have shed light on the Red Planet's watery past, suggesting that it once harbored a vast ocean covering about 20% of its surface, equivalent to a depth of 137 meters. This ancient ocean, which may have been a mile deep, is believed to have been at least a mile deep, potentially covering the northern hemisphere in a significant body of water.\n\nThe evidence for this ocean comes from the analysis of the Martian atmosphere, which shows a higher concentration of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, compared to Earth. This suggests that Mars once had a much higher concentration of water vapor in its atmosphere, which would have made it a more habitable environment for life.\n\nThe Martian ocean is thought to have been at least a mile deep, and the water molecules in it were enriched with deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. This enrichment factor of about seven times the Earth's ocean water suggests that the Martian ocean was once at least 137 meters deep, which would have been enough to cover the entire planet.\n\nThe idea that Mars was once a wetter and warmer planet is further supported by the discovery of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere. The isotopic analysis of the atmosphere's vapor suggests that Mars once had a much higher proportion of deuterium than Earth, indicating that the planet lost a significant amount of water over time.\n\nThe evidence for the existence of a vast ocean on Mars has been bolstered by the analysis of sunlight reflecting off the planet's surface, which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere. The higher concentration of deuterium in the Martian ocean is about 20 times that of Earth, suggesting that the Martian ocean was much deeper and warmer than it is today.\n\nThe findings have led to the conclusion that Mars was once a more habitable world, with a thicker ocean and a warmer environment that allowed for the existence of liquid water. The higher concentration of deuterium in the Martian ocean suggests that the water was once in a liquid state, which would have made the planet much warmer than it is today.\n\nThe evidence for the existence of a vast ocean on Mars is compelling,", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Then, seek out financial experts, but not too many—you want to keep the news quiet as long as possible. \"Start with one experienced attorney and look for a seasoned certified financial planner,\" Almasy writes. Big question: Is there any way you can legally remain anonymous? If you live in South Carolina or a handful of other states, the answer is yes, but generally you'll have a tough time hiding. You might want to hire a PR person. In fact, you might want to slip out of the country until the hubbub over the prize has died down. Didn't win?

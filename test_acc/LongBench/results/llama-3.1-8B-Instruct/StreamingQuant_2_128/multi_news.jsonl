The letter, published in Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, reveals Kalashnikov's spiritual pain and moral responsibility for the deaths caused by his rifle.\n\nKalashnikov, who designed the AK-47 in 1947, had previously refused to accept responsibility for the lives lost due to his invention. However, in his letter, he wrote, \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can I be the one responsible for their deaths?\" He also questioned why the Lord allowed him to create a \"killing machine.\"\n\nThe letter, signed with a wavering hand, was written on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper and is dated April 2012. The letter was published in Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, and reveals a change of heart in Kalashnikov's views on his invention.\n\nThe AK-47, designed by Kalashnikov, has been used in various conflicts worldwide, including by child soldiers. The Russian Orthodox Church's position on the matter is that the Church supports the use of the rifle when it serves to defend the country, but not when it is used by terrorists.\n\nKalashnikov's daughter, Elena, stated that her father's letter was likely written with the help of a priest, as Kalashnikov had been baptized at the age of 94.

{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs: A Growing Concern**\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the alarming relationship between cigarette smoke and the virulence of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Research conducted by the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine has revealed that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also fuels the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at the University of California, San Diego, cigarette smoke can stress MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls and become more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is evident in both human cells and mice, where MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA.\n\nThe study found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are essential for killing bacteria. Furthermore, the smoke-exposed MRSA was more adept at adhering to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to invade and cause infections.\n\nThe study also compared the effects of cigarette smoke to e-cigarette vapor, finding that cigarette smoke had a more significant impact on MRSA's virulence. The study suggests that cigarette smoke can be a contributing factor to the increased susceptibility to infectious diseases in smokers.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, as cigarette smoke can not only harm the smoker's respiratory and immune systems but also make pathogens more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This highlights the importance of refraining from smoking to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n- Cigarette smoke fuels the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses.\n- MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA.\n- Cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species.\n- Cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more adept at adhering to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to invade and cause infections.\n- Cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to the immune system's defenses for up to 24 hours after exposure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCigarette smoke has a significant impact on the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The study used two methods: PageRank, which measures the importance of a page based on the number of links pointing to it, and CheiRank, which measures the importance of a person based on the number of pages they are linked to. By combining these two methods, the study found that Frank Sinatra is the most important person in the world, followed by Michael Jackson and Madonna. However, this result was skewed by the fact that the study was heavily influenced by the number of scientific names in Wikipedia, particularly those related to Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist who developed the system of binomial nomenclature.\n\nHowever, when the study was repeated with a different method, CheiRank, which measures the number of outgoing links from a page, the results were different. According to CheiRank, the most influential person in the world is actually Carl Linnaeus, the Swedish naturalist who developed the system of binomial nomenclature. This is because Linnaeus is linked to a vast number of pages, including those related to the classification of species.\n\nAnother study, led by Young-Ho Eom, found that the most influential person in the world is actually Carl Linnaeus.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

This issue is not just a moral imperative but also a global problem that can be solved. The founder of Lumos, a charity dedicated to ending the practice of institutionalizing children, shares a personal account of how she became aware of this issue and the impact it has on children worldwide.\n\nThe author, JK Rowling, recounts how she was initially hesitant to confront the reality of institutionalized children but eventually took action, leading to the establishment of Lumos.

These children are often taken away from their families due to poverty, lack of education, and healthcare, and are then placed in institutions that are often inhumane.\n\nHowever, there is hope.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones?

Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

Several high-profile individuals have experienced a significant decline in their stature, often due to circumstances beyond their control or their own actions. Here are five notable examples:\n\n1. **Anthony Scaramucci**: The former White House Director of Communications was fired in July 2017, just 10 days into his tenure. His short-lived stint was marred by protocol breaches, conflicts with other officials, and a public feud with the FBI Director, James Comey. Scaramucci's divorce and a clean slate for the new White House Director, John Kelly, were cited as reasons for his termination.\n\n2. **Chris Christie**: The former Governor of New Jersey and presidential contender was embroiled in the Bridgegate scandal, where a traffic jam was orchestrated to target a rival politician. His reputation was further tarnished by his family's access to a closed beach during a government shutdown. Christie's low approval ratings and the scandal surrounding the George Washington Bridge incident led to his downfall.\n\n3. **James Comey**: The former FBI Director was fired by President Trump in May 2017, citing a lack of confidence in his leadership. His public statements on the 2016 election and the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email use led to controversy. His handling of the investigation and the FBI's protocol was questioned.\n\n4. **Mark Fields**: The former Ford Motor Company CEO was let go in May 2017 after a 27-year tenure. His failure to inspire confidence in investors and his decision to invest in electric vehicle technology led to a 40% drop in Ford's stock price. His inability to boost the company's stock price led to his termination.\n\n5. **Tiger Woods**: The professional golfer's reputation has been marred by a series of scandals, including a DUI incident in 2017. His ranking in the golf world has plummeted, and he has not won a major tournament since 2013. His personal life has been marred by infidelity and a DUI incident, which led to a significant decline in his golf ranking.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- High-profile individuals can fall from power and fame quickly.\n- Circumstances beyond their control can lead to their downfall.\n- Scandals and controversies can tarnish a person's reputation.\n- The public eye can be unforgiving, and a single misstep can lead to a significant decline in stature.", "answers": ["Power: One day you have it, the next you don't.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Researchers analyzed data from nearly 260,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 (15%) of them were under 50. This is a stark contrast to the current guidelines, which recommend starting colon cancer screenings at age 50.\n\n**Demographics and Treatment Patterns**\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, found that younger patients (under 50) were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, with 37% of patients under 50 having cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes, and 50% more likely to have cancer that had spread to other organs. However, despite having more aggressive cancer, younger patients lived longer without a recurrence, with 95% of patients under 50 surviving five years without a recurrence, compared to 92% of patients over 50.\n\n**Symptoms and Detection**\n\nResearchers note that younger patients tend to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer due to symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel movements, and pain. However, these symptoms are often ignored or attributed to other conditions. Dr. Hendren emphasizes that doctors should be on the lookout for these warning signs, especially in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer.\n\n**Current Guidelines and Recommendations**\n\nThe current guidelines recommend starting colon cancer screenings at age 50. However, some researchers suggest that this age may be too late, as 15% of patients under 50 are diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer. Dr. Hendren notes that people with a family history of colorectal cancer should start screening earlier, but this is not consistently being done.\n\n**Future Directions**\n\nThe study's findings raise questions about whether the guidelines should be revised to start screenings at an earlier age. Dr. David Weinberg notes that the data does not support expanding screening to younger age groups, citing the low incidence of colon cancer in this age group. However, Dr. Hendren suggests that the medical community should prepare for the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support.\n\n**Risk Factors and Prevention**\n\nResearchers note that the reasons for the increase in colon cancer in younger adults are unclear, but possible factors include environmental factors, obesity, smoking, and poor diet. Dr.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "**Harnessing the Power of Stars: A Quest for Universal Energy**\n\nA recent paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper has revived the concept of a galactic energy-harvesting model proposed by Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. The three stages of galactic expansion, or \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations, are:\n\n1. **Type I**: Harnessing all the resources of a planet, which is where humanity currently stands, with a rating of 0.7 on the Kardashev scale.\n2. **Type II**: Harnessing all the energy of a star, which is the next step in the galactic expansion model. This would require a network of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to collect and beam energy back to the home planet.\n3. **Type III**: Harnessing the energy of an entire galaxy, which is the ultimate goal of a universal civilization.\n\nHowever, a new twist on Kardashev's model suggests that the universe's accelerating expansion due to dark energy will make it difficult for civilizations to access energy from distant stars. As the universe expands, stars beyond our local group will eventually become inaccessible, and the stars we see today will be the last ones to be harvested.\n\n**The Quest for Alien Energy**\n\nAstrophysicist Dan Hooper proposes that a civilization would need to collect and harness the energy of stars in other galaxies to survive. This would require a network of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to collect and beam energy back to the home planet. The energy-harvesting aliens would likely be able to collect stars with masses between 20 and 100 times that of our sun.\n\n**Detecting Alien Energy Harvesting**\n\nTo detect signs of alien civilizations, astronomers would need to look for unusual light signatures from stars that are being harvested. These signatures would be detectable in the form of longer wavelengths of light, which would be produced by the radiation from the stars. However, this would require more advanced technology than what we currently possess.\n\n**The Search for Alien Energy Harvesting**\n\nThe search for alien civilizations has been ongoing for decades, with many scientists and science fiction authors proposing various methods for detecting and harnessing the energy of distant stars. Some of the key concepts include:\n\n* Spherical energy-trapping structures, such as Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\" and Freeman Dyson's \"Dyson sphere\"\n* Spherical energy-trapping structures made of satellites, which would collect and beam energy from the star\n", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Apple's marketing chief, Phil Schiller, defended the decision by stating that it takes \"courage\" to move away from the standard headphone jack. However, many have disputed this claim, calling it \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" and \"stupidity.\"\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack is seen as a step back for convenience and sound quality. Critics argue that the standard 3.5mm headphone jack is the most successful, widespread, and best-sounding audio standard in the world. Apple's proprietary Lightning cable and AirPods, on the other hand, have been criticized for their lack of sound quality and ease of use. The AirPods, which require a $159 price tag, have been described as \"dumb\" and \"easy to lose.\" The lack of a headphone jack also means that users can no longer charge their phone and listen to music at the same time, unless they use a $9 aux-to-Lightning cable or a wireless connection.\n\nApple's justification for removing the headphone jack is that it's a \"premium\" feature, but critics argue that this is a false excuse. The iPhone 7's design is at a premium, but the headphone jack is not the reason. The real reason is likely due to Apple's desire to sell more expensive and proprietary accessories.\n\nThe iPhone 7's design has also been criticized for its lack of convenience, as users can no longer charge their phone and listen to music at the same time. The old Apple mantra of \"it just works\" is now dead, as users will have to use a $9 aux-to-Lightning cable or a wireless connection to listen to music.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the iPhone 7's design has sparked a heated debate on social media, with many users expressing their frustration and disappointment with the new design. The hashtag #AppleEvent has been trending on Twitter, with users sharing their thoughts on the new iPhone 7 and AirPods.\n\nIn conclusion, the removal of the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 has sparked a heated debate, with many users and critics questioning Apple's decision.

The island nation's parliament has passed a law that makes possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) of marijuana a petty offense, punishable by a fine rather than a criminal record. This move is seen as a major victory for Jamaican lawmakers and advocates who have been pushing for the decriminalization of marijuana for decades.\n\nThe new law also paves the way for the establishment of a medical cannabis industry, allowing for the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The law will be enforced by a licensing authority, which will oversee the industry and ensure compliance with international treaties and agreements.\n\nThe new law makes Jamaica the latest country to ease restrictions on marijuana, following a trend of relaxation in various countries. In the United States, several states have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use, including Colorado, Washington, and Alaska, which recently became the third state to legalize recreational use for adults. Uruguay, the first country to establish a legal marijuana industry, has also seen a significant reduction in marijuana-related arrests.\n\nJamaica's move is seen as a significant step towards correcting decades of injustice, particularly for the Rastafarian community, who have been disproportionately affected by marijuana laws. The law aims to reduce friction between police and citizens, particularly young people, and to promote a more progressive approach to marijuana use.\n\nKey points of the new law include:\n\n- Possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana is a petty offense, punishable by a fine.\n- Cultivation of up to five plants is allowed for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.\n- Rastafarians can use marijuana for spiritual purposes.\n- Tourists can apply for permits to buy small amounts of marijuana for medical purposes.\n- The law does not change Jamaica's stance on international treaties and agreements.\n\nThe law is expected to bring significant economic benefits to Jamaica, including the development of a medical marijuana industry and the creation of new jobs. However, the law also raises concerns about the potential for increased trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, particularly in the Caribbean region.\n\nInternational reactions to the law have been mixed, with the US State Department expressing concerns about the potential for increased trafficking.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The study's findings suggest that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved independently in different groups, including birds, crocodiles, and non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, a professor at Midwestern University, said that the results show that closed-mouth vocalizations are not a primitive trait in birds, but rather a derived trait that evolved independently in different groups. The study's findings also suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in some non-avian dinosaurs, including the ancestors of modern birds.\n\nThe study's results are based on a statistical analysis of 208 bird species, including 52 species that make closed-mouth sounds. The study found that closed-mouth vocalizations are more common in birds that are larger in size, such as ostriches and doves. The study's findings suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization evolved independently in different groups, including birds, crocodiles, and non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nThe study's results also shed light on the evolution of sound production in birds and other animals. The study's findings suggest that the unique vocalizations of birds and other animals are a result of independent evolutionary events. The study's results also suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in some non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur sounds. The study's results suggest that some dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to those of birds, with low, throaty sounds. The study's findings also suggest that the sounds made by dinosaurs may have been low, throaty sounds, similar to those made by birds.\n\nThe study's results also highlight the importance of understanding the evolution of sound production in birds and other animals.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

However, the name has been a source of tension, particularly for students and staff who have long felt that it perpetuates a symbol of racism and slavery. \n\nChancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos, who has been a strong advocate for the name change, stated that the name \"Confederate Memorial Hall\" is \"a symbol that is, for many people, a reminder of the painful history of slavery and racism.\" He emphasized that the university's decision to rename the building is not a rejection of its history but rather a way to acknowledge and learn from it.\n\nThe decision to rename the building was made possible after the university agreed to pay $1.2 million to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the Tennessee chapter of the organization that donated the original $50,000 to name the building. The payment is equivalent to the original donation made 83 years ago.\n\nThe move comes as universities across the country are grappling with the implications of their own histories and symbols. In Tennessee, Middle Tennessee State University is also seeking to remove the name of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings, while the state's new law makes it more difficult to remove historical markers.\n\nThe decision to rename the building has been met with criticism from some, including Doug Jones, a Nashville attorney who represented the Daughters of the Confederacy in a 2005 court case. He stated that the decision is \"a real slam on the history of our country\" and that it is a \"sad day for a school with a reputation like Vanderbilt's.\"\n\nThe decision to rename the building is seen as a step towards acknowledging the painful history of the Civil War and the ongoing struggle for racial equality. As Chancellor Zeppos said, \"We are not saying this is not part of our history, but we are saying that we can talk about it in a way that is more nuanced and accurate.\"\n\nThe move is part of a broader effort", "answers": ["In an attempt to bury a relic of its past, Vanderbilt University announced Monday that it will pay more than $1 million to remove the word \"Confederate\" from one of its dorms, the Tennessean reports.

A state appeals court ruled the building could be renamed Memorial Hall only after Vanderbilt gave the United Daughters back their money—$1.2 million in today’s dollars.

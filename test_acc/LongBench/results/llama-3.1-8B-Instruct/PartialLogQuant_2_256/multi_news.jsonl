However, despite the deadline passing, the protesters remained, with some even serving squash soup and handing out water to their fellow protesters. The police, while initially prepared to make arrests, ultimately decided to let the protesters stay, with Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan stating that the police were \"calmly\" watching the situation.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the LAPD declared an unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to disperse from City Hall, but ultimately decided not to make any arrests. The protesters, who had set up a camp of over 2,000 people, were given a deadline to vacate the area, but many chose to stay. The police eventually allowed the protesters to remain, with the police commander, Andy Smith, stating that it was \"highly unlikely\" that the camp would be shut down.\n\nIn contrast, the city of Oakland, California, has seen a more tense standoff between police and Occupy protesters.

The research, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, reveals that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also fuels the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and the human immune system.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at the University of California, San Diego, and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, cigarette smoke acts as an alarm to the bacteria, causing it to alter its cell walls and become more resistant to the host's immune response. This stress response allows MRSA to evade the host's defenses, making it more difficult to treat.\n\nThe study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to the host's immune response compared to non-exposed MRSA. Furthermore, the smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it more difficult to kill. The study also discovered that the smoke-exposed MRSA was more adept at adhering to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to invade and cause infection.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke is not only detrimental to human health but also contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This alarming discovery highlights the need for individuals to refrain from smoking to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nA similar study conducted by the same research team in 2015 found that e-cigarette vapor also increased the virulence of MRSA, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke is a significant contributing factor to the increased virulence of MRSA, making it a critical factor in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, particularly for smokers who are more susceptible to infectious diseases. The study's results emphasize the need for individuals to quit smoking to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and reduce the risk of severe infections.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Cigarette smoke fuels the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to the host's immune response.\n* MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke is four times more resistant to the host's immune response.\n* Cigarette smoke", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The tax, implemented by former Mayor Ed Murray, was touted as a way to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for public health initiatives, and subsidize low-income families. However, the tax has been deemed regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and driving them to buy sugary drinks outside the city limits.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed after just two months due to public outcry and a decline in sales. The tax added a penny per ounce to sugary drinks, but was later repealed after a court ruling. The tax was seen as a failure, with many retailers and restaurants reporting significant losses in sales and revenue.\n\nIn Seattle, the tax has led to a 64% increase in the price of a case of Gatorade, from $15.99 to $26.33. Retailers like Costco have taken to posting signs directing customers to nearby suburbs where they can buy the same products without the tax.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

However, Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), have vowed to reject any bill that includes these provisions, citing the need to keep the government funded and pay its bills.\n\n**Senate Democrats' Strategy**\n\nSenate Democrats, led by Reid, are taking a hardline stance against the House's proposal, believing that it will be more difficult for Republicans to negotiate concessions on a long-term spending bill. Reid has taken a firm stance against making any concessions on the Affordable Care Act, believing that it will be more difficult for Republicans to pass a bill that does not include the law.\n\n**Economic Impact**\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers, is expected to be severely impacted by a shutdown. An estimated 700,000 federal workers will be furloughed, and the region's economy will lose an estimated $200 million a day. The shutdown will also affect the national capital's economy, with the Smithsonian museums, the National Zoo, and other attractions closing their doors.\n\n**Regional Impact**\n\nThe D.C. region is particularly vulnerable to the shutdown, with 60% of the area's federal workers expected to be furloughed.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The breach is believed to have occurred when hackers stole credit card information from customers who made purchases at the company's stores. However, the company claims that Social Security numbers and birth dates were not compromised. Neiman Marcus has offered one year of free credit monitoring to affected customers.\n\n**Target Breach**\n\nTarget, a major retailer, was also hit by a massive data breach, affecting over 40 million customers. A report from computer firm iSight reveals that the breach was caused by a type of malware that was placed in the company's point-of-sale systems. The malware was able to suck up customer data, including credit card numbers, in the memory of the system before it was encrypted. The report notes that the hacking technique used was \"new to eCrime\" and was made possible by the existence of software coding capabilities in Eastern Europe.\n\n**International Hacking Campaign**\n\nThe data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target appear to be part of a broader international hacking campaign, with multiple retailers being targeted. The report from iSight suggests that the hacking was carried out by cybercriminals in Eastern Europe, who used sophisticated malware to steal customer data. The report notes that the hacking technique used was \"new to eCrime\" and was made possible by the existence of software coding capabilities in Eastern Europe.\n\n**Investigations and Consequences**\n\nThe data breaches have led to investigations by state attorneys general and the Secret Service.

The new policy, introduced by Chief Talent Officer Tawni Cranz, aims to foster a \"freedom and responsibility\" culture that gives employees the flexibility to balance their work and family life.\n\nUnder the new policy, employees can take off as much time as they need during the first year, and can return to work on a full- or part-time basis, or take time off as needed. Netflix will continue to pay employees normally, eliminating the need to switch to state or disability pay. This policy is designed to support employees in managing their work and family responsibilities, allowing them to return to work more focused and dedicated.\n\nThe company's decision to introduce this policy is part of its efforts to attract and retain top talent in the industry. Netflix believes that employees perform better when they are not stressed about work-life balance, and this policy is a step towards achieving that goal. The company's unlimited time-off policy, combined with the new leave policy, aims to provide employees with the flexibility and confidence to manage their family responsibilities without compromising their work.\n\nThe introduction of this policy is significant, as it highlights Netflix's commitment to supporting its employees' work-life balance. The company's decision to offer unlimited paid leave is a competitive advantage in the industry, and it is expected to attract top talent in the field. The policy also reflects the changing needs of employees, who are increasingly seeking better work-life balance and flexibility in their careers.\n\nWhile the policy has received praise, it also raises concerns about the potential strain on workplace relations and project deadlines. Netflix's competitors, including Google and Yahoo, have also introduced similar policies, highlighting the growing trend of companies prioritizing employee well-being and work-life balance.\n\nOverall, Netflix's new policy is a significant step towards creating a more supportive work environment, and it is expected to have a positive impact on employee morale and productivity.", "answers": ["Expecting parents wondering which company offers the best maternity and paternity leave in the US need look no further.

Simpson has been imprisoned since 2008 over an armed robbery and kidnapping case, but he and many legal analysts think that the board will vote to release him. If so, he's expected to be out on Oct. 1. The televised hearing is being livestreamed at various sites, including CNN. Per CNN, one of the first questions posed to Simpson by a board member in regard to the robbery, in which he and other men entered a Vegas hotel room to reclaim sports memorabilia, was, \"What were you thinking?\" Simpson called it a \"big mistake\" and emphasized that he wasn't armed. \"I would never pull a gun on anybody.\" He insisted that he learned only afterward that one of the men with him, who was \"behind me,\" brandished a gun. Another board member noted that he hadn't taken an alcohol-abuse program as he promised he would at his last hearing.

The problem occurred on Wednesday when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a pre-set temperature limit. This forced NASA to reroute coolant into the other loop, Loop-B, and temporarily shut down non-critical systems to preserve power and resources.\n\nAccording to NASA spokesman Josh Byerly, the crew was never in any danger, and the situation is being closely monitored.

On the eve of the storm, National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a dire warning that would go down in history. His bulletin, titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE,\" predicted \"most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks, perhaps longer\" and warned of \"unprecedented\" destruction, including \"most trees will be snapped or uprooted.\" This extraordinary forecast was a turning point in the history of weather forecasting, as it conveyed the urgency and severity of the storm in a way that resonated with the public.\n\nRicks' bold statement was part of a broader effort by the National Weather Service to convey the gravity of severe weather events. In recent years, the agency has encouraged meteorologists to use more direct language in their forecasts, as seen in the example of meteorologist Gary Szatkowski's plea to evacuate during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nRicks, a lifelong resident of New Orleans and a veteran of previous storms, including Hurricane Betsy and Camille, knew the severity of the storm and the potential for catastrophic damage. He drew on his experience and expertise to craft a warning that would convey the urgency of the situation. His document, which was widely circulated across the country, was a call to action, urging people to take the storm seriously and evacuate.\n\nThe storm's aftermath was devastating, with widespread destruction and loss of life. Ricks and his colleagues rode out the storm in Slidell, Louisiana, and were left to survey the damage. Ricks' document has become a landmark in weather forecasting, a reminder of the importance of clear and direct communication in the face of severe weather events.\n\nIn a post-storm interview, Ricks reflected on the heart-wrenching experience, saying, \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one. I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf.\" His words serve as a testament to the importance of accurate and timely communication in the face of disaster.\n\nThe legacy of Ricks' warning continues to inspire the National Weather Service to prioritize clear and direct language in their forecasts, ensuring that the public is prepared for the worst-case scenario.", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day.

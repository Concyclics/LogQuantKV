However, despite the deadline passing, the protesters remained, with some even serving squash soup and handing out water to their fellow protesters. The police, while initially prepared to make arrests, ultimately decided to let the protesters stay, with Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan stating that the police were \"calmly\" watching the situation.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the LAPD declared an unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to disperse from City Hall, but ultimately decided not to make any arrests. The protesters, who had set up a camp of over 2,000 people, were given a deadline to vacate the area, but many chose to stay. The police eventually allowed the protesters to remain, with the police commander, Andy Smith, stating that it was \"highly unlikely\" that the camp would be shut down.\n\nIn contrast, the city of Oakland, California, has seen a more tense standoff between police and Occupy protesters.

The research, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, reveals that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also fuels the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and the human immune system.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at the University of California, San Diego, and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, cigarette smoke acts as an alarm to the bacteria, causing it to alter its cell walls and become more resistant to the host's immune response. This stress response allows MRSA to evade the host's defenses, making it more difficult to treat.\n\nThe study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to the host's immune response compared to non-exposed MRSA. Furthermore, the smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it more difficult to kill. The study also discovered that the smoke-exposed MRSA was more adept at adhering to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to invade and cause infection.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke is not only detrimental to human health but also contributes to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This alarming discovery highlights the need for individuals to refrain from smoking to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nA similar study conducted by the same research team in 2015 found that e-cigarette vapor also increased the virulence of MRSA, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke is a significant contributing factor to the increased virulence of MRSA, making it a critical factor in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, particularly for smokers who are more susceptible to infectious diseases. The study's results emphasize the need for individuals to quit smoking to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and reduce the risk of severe infections.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Cigarette smoke fuels the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to the host's immune response.\n* MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke is four times more resistant to the host's immune response.\n* Cigarette smoke", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The tax, implemented by former Mayor Ed Murray, was touted as a way to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for public health initiatives, and subsidize low-income families. However, the tax has been deemed regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and driving them to buy sugary drinks outside the city limits.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed after just two months due to public outcry and a decline in sales. The tax added a penny per ounce to sugary drinks, but was later repealed after a court ruling. The tax was seen as a failure, with many retailers and restaurants reporting significant losses in sales and revenue.\n\nIn Seattle, the tax has led to a 64% increase in the price of a case of Gatorade, from $15.99 to $26.33. Retailers like Costco have taken to posting signs directing customers to nearby suburbs where they can buy the same products without the tax.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

However, Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), have vowed to reject any bill that includes these provisions, citing the need to keep the government funded and pay its bills.\n\n**Senate Democrats' Strategy**\n\nSenate Democrats, led by Reid, are taking a hardline stance against the House's proposal, believing that it will be more difficult for Republicans to negotiate concessions on a long-term spending bill. Reid has taken a firm stance against making any concessions on the Affordable Care Act, believing that it will be more difficult for Republicans to pass a bill that does not include the law.\n\n**Economic Impact**\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers, is expected to be severely impacted by a shutdown. An estimated 700,000 federal workers will be furloughed, and the region's economy will lose an estimated $200 million a day. The shutdown will also affect the national capital's economy, with the Smithsonian museums, the National Zoo, and other attractions closing their doors.\n\n**Regional Impact**\n\nThe D.C. region is particularly vulnerable to the shutdown, with 60% of the area's federal workers expected to be furloughed.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The breach is believed to have occurred when hackers stole credit card information from customers who made purchases at the company's stores. However, the company claims that Social Security numbers and birth dates were not compromised. Neiman Marcus has offered one year of free credit monitoring to affected customers.\n\n**Target Breach**\n\nTarget, a major retailer, was also hit by a massive data breach, affecting over 40 million customers. A report from computer firm iSight reveals that the breach was caused by a type of malware that was placed in the company's point-of-sale systems. The malware was able to suck up customer data, including credit card numbers, in the memory of the system before it was encrypted. The report notes that the hacking technique used was \"new to eCrime\" and was made possible by the existence of software coding capabilities in Eastern Europe.\n\n**International Hacking Campaign**\n\nThe data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target appear to be part of a broader international hacking campaign, with multiple retailers being targeted. The report from iSight suggests that the hacking was carried out by cybercriminals in Eastern Europe, who used sophisticated malware to steal customer data. The report notes that the hacking technique used was \"new to eCrime\" and was made possible by the existence of software coding capabilities in Eastern Europe.\n\n**Investigations and Consequences**\n\nThe data breaches have led to investigations by state attorneys general and the Secret Service.

The new policy, introduced by Chief Talent Officer Tawni Cranz, aims to foster a \"freedom and responsibility\" culture that gives employees the flexibility to balance their work and family life.\n\nUnder the new policy, employees can take off as much time as they need during the first year, and can return to work on a full- or part-time basis, or take time off as needed. Netflix will continue to pay employees normally, eliminating the need to switch to state or disability pay. This policy is designed to support employees in managing their work and family responsibilities, allowing them to return to work more focused and dedicated.\n\nThe company's decision to introduce this policy is part of its efforts to attract and retain top talent in the industry. Netflix believes that employees perform better when they are not stressed about work-life balance, and this policy is a step towards achieving that goal. The company's unlimited time-off policy, combined with the new leave policy, aims to provide employees with the flexibility and confidence to manage their family responsibilities without compromising their work.\n\nThe introduction of this policy is significant, as it highlights Netflix's commitment to supporting its employees' work-life balance. The company's decision to offer unlimited paid leave is a competitive advantage in the industry, and it is expected to attract top talent in the field. The policy also reflects the changing needs of employees, who are increasingly seeking better work-life balance and flexibility in their careers.\n\nWhile the policy has received praise, it also raises concerns about the potential strain on workplace relations and project deadlines. Netflix's competitors, including Google and Yahoo, have also introduced similar policies, highlighting the growing trend of companies prioritizing employee well-being and work-life balance.\n\nOverall, Netflix's new policy is a significant step towards creating a more supportive work environment, and it is expected to have a positive impact on employee morale and productivity.", "answers": ["Expecting parents wondering which company offers the best maternity and paternity leave in the US need look no further.

SPECIAL MESSAGE,\" predicted \"most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks, perhaps longer\" and warned of \"unprecedented\" destruction, including \"most trees will be snapped or uprooted.\" This extraordinary forecast was a turning point in the history of weather forecasting, as it conveyed the urgency and severity of the storm in a way that resonated with the public.\n\nRicks' bold statement was part of a broader effort by the National Weather Service to convey the gravity of severe weather events. In recent years, the agency has encouraged meteorologists to use more direct language in their forecasts, as seen in the example of meteorologist Gary Szatkowski's plea to evacuate during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.\n\nRicks, a lifelong resident of New Orleans and a veteran of previous storms, including Hurricane Betsy and Camille, knew the severity of the storm and the potential for catastrophic damage.

This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults. Researchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that younger patients were more likely to have advanced cancer and were diagnosed at a later stage, often due to symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel habits, or pain.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* 37,847 patients (15% of the total) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer under the age of 50.\n* Younger patients were more likely to have advanced cancer and were diagnosed at a later stage, but they lived longer without a cancer recurrence.\n* Younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) compared to older patients.\n* Five-year survival rates were higher for younger patients: 95.1% for patients under 50, 91.9% for patients 50-64, and 85.6% for patients over 65.\n\n**Implications and Recommendations:**\n\n* Researchers suggest that the medical community should be more vigilant in screening for colorectal cancer in younger adults, particularly those with a family history or risk factors.\n* Dr. Samantha Hendren, lead author of the study, notes that younger patients are more likely to have advanced cancer, but they also tend to live longer without a cancer recurrence.\n* Dr. David Weinberg, a cancer expert, notes that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer rates among younger adults are unclear, but may be related to environmental factors, such as diet, smoking, and physical inactivity.\n* Dr. Hendren emphasizes the need for more research to determine whether screening guidelines should be altered to start at an earlier age.\n\n**Expert Opinions:**\n\n* Dr. Andrew Chan, a Harvard Medical School professor, notes that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer rates among younger adults are unknown, but may be related to lifestyle factors.\n* Dr. David Weinberg notes that the data does not support expanding screening to younger age groups, citing low risk rates.\n* Dr. Hendren emphasizes the need for more research to determine the best course", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

Kardashev's three stages of galactic expansion, or \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations, are:\n\n1. **Type I**: Harnessing all of a planet's resources.\n2. **Type II**: Harnessing the energy of a star.\n3. **Type III**: Harnessing the energy of a galaxy.\n\nHooper's paper adds an apocalyptic twist, suggesting that a civilization must harvest energy from other stars to prevent being left behind in the expanding universe. The accelerating expansion of the universe, caused by dark energy, will eventually make stars beyond our local group inaccessible. A civilization must capture and harness stars before they are lost forever.\n\n**The Method of Energy Harvesting**\n\nTo harness energy from other stars, a civilization would need to create a swarm of satellites, known as a \"Dyson sphere,\" to collect and beam energy back to their home planet. This concept was first proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1960. The satellites would not be a rigid shell but a cloud of individual satellites, called \"statites,\" that would hover in space and collect energy from the star.\n\n**Detecting Alien Civilizations**\n\nAstrophysicist Dan Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations would be detectable by their waste heat, which would be radiated as longer wavelengths of light. This would be visible in the light signatures of galaxies that have been stripped of their stars. However, this detection method requires advanced technology and instruments.\n\n**The Search for Alien Civilizations**\n\nThe search for alien civilizations has been a topic of interest for decades. Science fiction authors like Olaf Stapledon and Freeman Dyson have described the concept of energy-harvesting structures. These ideas have inspired scientists to propose similar structures as a means of harnessing energy from stars. The search for alien civilizations is a complex task, requiring a deep understanding of the universe and its expansion.\n\n**The Future of Energy Harvesting**\n\nThe universe is expanding, and civilizations must adapt to harness energy from other stars to survive. The search for alien civilizations is a complex task, requiring advanced technology and understanding of the universe. The concept of energy-harvesting structures has been explored in science fiction and science. The search for alien civilizations is an ongoing effort, with scientists and science fiction", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The airline's license to fly the route has been suspended, and the Transport Ministry has announced a review of all AirAsia flights.\n\nThe search for the black boxes, which contain crucial data on the plane's final moments, continues, with the hope that they will provide valuable information on the cause of the crash. The black boxes are still missing, but the discovery of the wreckage has raised hopes that the investigation will be able to determine the cause of the crash.\n\nThe families of the victims have been waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones, with many still missing. The bodies of 30 people have been recovered, but many more are believed to be trapped inside the plane. The relatives of the victims have been holding out hope that the bodies of their loved ones will be recovered.\n\nThe investigation into the crash has been ongoing, with officials from the Transport Ministry and the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) working to determine the cause of the crash. The Transport Ministry has said that the airline's license to fly the route was not valid on the day of the crash, and that the airline had not followed the correct procedures for weather reports.\n\nAirAsia's CEO, Tony Fernandes, has expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and has said that the airline will cooperate fully with the investigation.

The Founding Fathers of the United States enshrined this right in the first article of the United States Constitution, ensuring that the executive branch could not hold individuals without evidence. However, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) revoked the right to habeas corpus for individuals labeled as \"enemy combatants\" at Guantanamo Bay and beyond.\n\n**Guantanamo Bay and the Military Commissions Act**\n\nThe MCA has led to the indefinite detention of nearly 800 men at Guantanamo Bay, with little to no evidence against them.

The company has been forced to shut down production and has been unable to sell its products due to the uncertainty surrounding the law.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also raised concerns among other guitar manufacturers and dealers, who are worried about the law's retroactive nature and the potential for owners of vintage instruments to be held accountable for the wood used in their construction. The law requires companies to certify the legality of the wood used in their products, but the process of compliance has been criticized as burdensome.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has been working to reduce the trade of endangered species, and the Lacey Act has been seen as a key tool in this effort.

The findings, published in the journal Science, suggest that an ancient ocean, at least 1.5 billion years ago, covered nearly half of the Martian surface, with the water being at least 7 times more abundant than it is today. The water was rich in deuterium, a heavy form of hydrogen, indicating that the planet lost a significant amount of water over time.\n\n**The Ancient Ocean**\n\nThe scientists used powerful telescopes to study the Martian atmosphere and found that the water on Mars was once rich in deuterium, a sign of significant water loss. The team, led by NASA's Geronimo Villanueva, discovered that the Martian water was enriched with deuterium, indicating that the planet lost a significant amount of water over time. The scientists estimate that the water was at least 7 times more abundant than it is today, and that it would have covered nearly half of the Martian surface.\n\n**The Size of the Ancient Ocean**\n\nThe ancient ocean was estimated to be at least 137 meters deep, and it would have covered nearly half of the Martian surface. The water would have been at least 20 meters deep in the northern hemisphere, where the Martian terrain is lower. The scientists believe that the water would have formed a global ocean, covering nearly half of the Martian surface, if the Martian atmosphere had been thicker.\n\n**The Water Loss**\n\nThe scientists believe that Mars lost a significant amount of water over time due to its weak gravity, which allowed the ordinary hydrogen to escape into space. This process, known as atmospheric sputtering, has been ongoing for billions of years, resulting in a higher proportion of deuterium in Martian water. The water loss has been estimated to be equivalent to six times the amount of water that is currently locked in the Martian ice caps.\n\n**The Implications**\n\nThe findings suggest that Mars was once a wet and habitable planet, with a significant amount of water covering nearly half of its surface. The ancient ocean would have provided a suitable environment for life to emerge and thrive. The discovery of ancient water on Mars has significant implications for the search for life beyond Earth.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has dismissed an appeal by Nestlé, ruling that the company failed to prove that the four-finger Kit Kat shape is distinctive enough to be trademarked across the European Union.\n\nThe case, which has been ongoing for over a decade, began when Nestlé applied for a trademark for the shape of the Kit Kat bar in 2006. However, the European Union's trademark office (EUIPO) initially rejected the application, citing that the shape was not distinctive enough. Nestlé appealed the decision, but the EU court has now thrown out the appeal, meaning the trademark will likely be annulled.\n\nThe decision has significant implications for the chocolate industry, as it means that the shape of the Kit Kat bar will no longer be protected as a trademark across the EU. However, the ruling does not necessarily mean that the shape will be open to copying by other companies. The EU trademark office may still consider other evidence, such as new proof of distinctiveness in more EU countries, to preserve the trademark.\n\nThe case has been closely watched by trademark lawyers and has implications for companies operating across the EU single market. The dispute has also been mirrored in the UK courts, where Nestlé has also sought to protect the Kit Kat shape, but was met with resistance from Cadbury, which owns the four-fingered shape. The case has been seen as a test of the EU's ability to protect iconic brands.\n\nThe outcome of the case has sparked debate among supporters of Brexit, who argue that the EU's failure to protect the Kit Kat shape is a sign of the EU's inability to defend British brands. However, the case has also highlighted the complexities of trademark law in the EU, where companies must prove that their brand is distinctive across all member states to secure protection.\n\nThe case has significant implications for the chocolate industry, with other companies, such as Toblerone and Lindt, also seeking to protect their iconic shapes.

The researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the vocalizations of birds and other reptiles, and found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which involve pushing air into an inhaled esophageal pouch, are a common trait among birds and other archosaurs.\n\nThe study found that closed-mouth vocalizations are low-frequency sounds that are often used by birds to attract mates or defend territories.

By using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer algorithms, they were able to reconstruct YouTube videos from brain activity patterns recorded while subjects watched the videos. This achievement marks a significant step towards decoding the brain's internal workings, including potentially reading minds, decoding dreams, and even reconstructing memories.\n\nThe study involved researchers lying inside an MRI machine while watching YouTube videos. The brain activity was recorded and used to build a model that matched visual patterns with brain activity. The model was then used to reconstruct the videos, creating a continuous, abstract representation of the original footage. The reconstructed videos are blurry and dream-like, but they demonstrate the potential of the technology.\n\nThe researchers believe that this technology could be used to decode internal imagery, such as dreams, memories, and even intentions. They also envision the possibility of using this technology to help people with paralysis control their environment by imagining movements. The team is now working on analyzing more areas of the brain to improve the resolution of the model and unlock the secrets of the brain's visual processing.\n\nWhile the technology is still in its infancy, it raises questions about its potential applications, including its use in detective work, court cases, and even understanding the nature of memories. However, the researchers caution that the accuracy of the reconstructed images is limited by the complexity of brain activity and the potential for misinterpretation.\n\nThe study's lead author, Shinji Nishimoto, said, \"We need to understand how the brain works in natural conditions to unlock the secrets of the brain.\" The researchers are optimistic that this technology will pave the way for understanding the brain's workings and potentially unlock new ways of communication and understanding the human mind.", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

Using the scans they were then able to reproduce the videos—though they’re blurry. “This is a major leap,” the co-author says. He thinks the technique could eventually be used to reconstruct dreams or memories, if it turns out the brain processes those things similarly to how it processes movies. “It’s our next line of research.” (More details on how the experiment worked, along with a video, at PC Magazine.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1188}

The main focus of the House has been on renaming the Dryden Flight Research Center as the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center, a move that has been seen as a way to honor the first man to walk on the moon. The bill, sponsored by Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), was passed with little opposition, with Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.) being the only Democrat to speak out against the bill, citing the irony of renaming the center while cutting NASA's budget.\n\nMeanwhile, the country is facing a looming deadline for sequestration, which would cut $85 billion from the federal budget. However, House Republicans have decided to do nothing to prevent the sequestration, instead choosing to let it take effect. This decision has been seen as a way to avoid making any concessions to President Obama's proposal to raise taxes and cut spending. The sequestration was designed to be a painful measure, cutting funding for various government programs, including NASA, Head Start, and the FBI. However, it's worth noting that the salaries of members of Congress will not be cut, and they will continue to receive their six-figure salaries.\n\nThe sequestration has been seen as a way to force both parties to come to a compromise, but it seems that politicians are more interested in avoiding the issue than finding a solution. The House has been in session for only a few days this month, with most of the time spent on ceremonial matters. The House has been criticized for its lack of productivity, with Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) taking up a minute to speak about the importance of the military, and Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas) taking up time to discuss the \"takeover\" of the healthcare system.\n\nPoliticians have been accused of using the sequestration as a scare tactic to avoid making tough decisions. However, it seems that the sequester is not as scary as politicians make it out to be. The sequester will cut funding for various government programs, but it will not affect the salaries of members of Congress. In fact, the sequester will not even cut the salaries of congressional staff, only reducing their pay by 20%.", "answers": ["We shouldn't be too worried about the sequester—after all, Congress doesn't exactly seem to be recoiling at the thought.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The study also notes that the problem is not just a matter of income, as people from all walks of life are affected.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n* 2.1 billion people worldwide are obese or overweight, exceeding 30% of the global population.\n* The number of obese people has increased by 28% in adults and 47% in children over the past 30 years.\n* The Middle East and North Africa have the highest obesity rates, with over 50% of men and 65% of women being overweight or obese.\n* Developing countries have over 50% of the world's obese population, with over 50% of adults being overweight or obese.\n* The problem is most acute in developing countries, where over 50% of adults are overweight or obese.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe global obesity epidemic is a pressing public health concern, affecting over 30", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns. The 188-country study found that there are 2.1 billion overweight or obese people in the world, making up around 30% of the world's population, up from 20% in 1980, USA Today reports. Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

The elections, which began in November, have seen the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party emerge as a dominant force, with the group's leader, Essam el-Erian, stating that the party may win a clean majority of seats in the full parliament. However, the Brotherhood has downplayed its chances, suggesting that it may not win more than 40% of the seats.\n\nThe trial of Mubarak, who has been charged with complicity in the deaths of over 800 protesters, has resumed after a two-month hiatus. The chief prosecutor, Mustafa Suleiman, accused Mubarak of imposing a \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensuring his son, Gamal, would succeed him. Suleiman also accused Mubarak's regime of engineering the most fraudulent parliamentary election in Egypt's history, with the ruling party winning all but a handful of seats.\n\nThe trial has been marked by controversy, with the prosecution facing criticism for not pushing hard enough for a conviction. Mubarak, who has been held in hospital since his arrest in April, was wheeled into the courtroom on a gurney, with his head resting on a pillow. His two sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also on trial, facing charges of corruption and complicity in the deaths of protesters.\n\nThe elections have seen a significant shift in Egypt's political landscape, with the Muslim Brotherhood emerging as a dominant force.

The military, which has maintained a tight grip on power, has vowed to retain control over the new government.\n\nThe country's economic situation remains uncertain, with a decline in tourism and foreign investment.

Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far.

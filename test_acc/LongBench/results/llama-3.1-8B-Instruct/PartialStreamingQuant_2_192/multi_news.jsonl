{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs**\n\nRecent studies have revealed a disturbing connection between cigarette smoke and the virulence of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have discovered that cigarette smoke can alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is linked to the increased ability of the bacteria to evade the reactive oxygen species generated by macrophages, a type of immune cell.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, cigarette smoke acts as an alarm to the bacteria, triggering a stress response that enhances its virulence. This stress response is more pronounced in cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA compared to non-exposed bacteria, making it more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed bacteria. Furthermore, the smoke-exposed bacteria were more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and had a higher ability to adhere to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to invade and cause infections.\n\nThe study also found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to the host's immune response, making it more virulent. This suggests that cigarette smoke may be an additional contributing factor to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases.\n\nIn a related study, researchers found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to the host's immune response, including macrophage killing and antimicrobial peptides. The study also found that the smoke-exposed bacteria were more resistant to the host's innate immune response, making them more virulent.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke may be an alternative explanation for the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases. The study's results have significant implications for public health, as they suggest that cigarette smoke may be an additional contributing factor to the increased virulence of MRSA.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n- Cigarette smoke alters the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to the host's immune response.\n- Cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA is four times more resistant to macrophage killing.\n- Cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA is more resistant to antimicrobial peptides.\n- Cigarette smoke-exposed bacteria are more resistant", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

The dispute centers around a priceless guitar, believed to be the last one played by Kurt Cobain before his death in 1994. Frances Bean claims the guitar is a family heirloom and a treasured instrument, while Isaiah says it was given to him as a gift when they were married in 2014. The guitar is now worth an estimated several million dollars, significantly more than its initial $1 million value.\n\nThe court battle is just one aspect of the couple's ongoing divorce proceedings. Frances Bean has been ordered to pay her husband $15,000 per month in spousal support, but Isaiah is now seeking a significant increase in payments, claiming that Frances has been using her father's estate to fund her lavish lifestyle. He is requesting $25,000 per month in spousal support, citing that Frances promised to cover his expenses during their marriage, including private school and housing for his child from a previous relationship.\n\nIsaiah claims that Frances has upwards of $100 million in her father's estate, and he believes he is entitled to half of that amount. Frances, however, has stated that the guitar is a family heirloom and not his to take. The couple's divorce proceedings have been ongoing since 2016, with Frances initially seeking to have the guitar returned to her. The matter is now set to go to court, with Frances reportedly ready to take the case to a judge.\n\nThe situation has become increasingly contentious, with Frances' mother, Courtney Love, allegedly sending threatening messages to her ex-husband's ex-girlfriend in an attempt to get the guitar back.

This issue has been largely ignored, with many people turning a blind eye to the suffering of these children. However, the founder of Lumos, a charity dedicated to closing institutions and keeping families together, argues that this is a problem that can be solved.\n\nLumos was founded in 2009 by JK Rowling, who was inspired to take action after seeing a disturbing photograph of a child locked in a caged bed. The organization has made significant progress in several countries, including Moldova, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70% since 2007. In the Czech Republic, the number of children in institutions has dropped by 16% nationally, while in the demonstration area, it has decreased by 34%. In Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has decreased by 54%, and the number of foster carers has increased by 440%.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization are well-documented and include malnutrition, stunted growth, and a higher risk of abuse and trafficking. However, the good news is that this problem can be solved. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050, and the organization has a proven track record of success in several countries.\n\nEnding the practice of institutionalizing children is not only a moral imperative but also a cost-effective solution. It is estimated that it costs 10 times more to keep a child in an institution than to support them in a family.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

At a hearing Friday, Jane's was ruled an accidental death due, in part, to using an app instead of a map. \"Apart from potential difficulties caused by poor detail on an electronic map, batteries on mobile phones have a nasty habit of running out just when you need them most,\" the Telegraph quotes a spokesperson for Mountain Rescue England and Wales as saying. A detective says the app map \"would have been small and not as detailed\" and took the couple on a route that was not the safest.

The tax was implemented in January 2018, with the goal of reducing sugar consumption and raising revenue for the city. However, the tax has been deemed regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and driving them to buy sugary drinks outside the city limits.\n\nThe tax has been a failure in achieving its intended goal of reducing sugar consumption, with many residents opting to buy their sugary drinks in the suburbs or outside the city. The tax has also had a devastating impact on local businesses, particularly those in the beverage industry. Retailers like Costco have seen a significant decline in sales, with some experiencing a 34% decline in sales of sugary drinks within the city limits. In contrast, their Cook County locations outside the city saw a corresponding increase in sales.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, as it does not apply to sugary drinks that contain milk as a primary ingredient, such as many flavored coffee drinks. This has led to accusations of unfairness and favoritism. The tax has also been criticized for its lack of consideration for the low-income families who rely on sugary drinks as a cheap source of calories.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of effectiveness in reducing sugar consumption.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The study analyzed data from over 64,000 children in the Danish National Birth Cohort study and found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen were more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder (HKD).\n\nAccording to the study, pregnant women who took acetaminophen were 29% more likely to have a child diagnosed with ADHD and 37% more likely to have a child diagnosed with HKD. The study also found that the risk of ADHD-like behaviors increased by 50% when mothers took acetaminophen for 20 weeks or more during pregnancy.\n\nHowever, the study's authors emphasize that the findings do not prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD. They also note that the study's results are based on observational data and that more research is needed to confirm the findings.\n\nExperts agree that pregnant women should weigh the risks and benefits of taking acetaminophen during pregnancy.

Anthony Scaramucci**\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the former White House Communications Director, was fired in July 2017, just 10 days after his appointment. His tenure was marked by controversy, including protocol breaches and public feuds with other officials. His short-lived stint in the White House was also marred by a divorce filing by his wife and a messy public interview with The New Yorker.\n\n**2. Chris Christie**\n\nGovernor of New Jersey and presidential contender Chris Christie has seen his reputation plummet due to his association with the Bridgegate scandal, where a traffic jam was orchestrated to target a rival politician. His reputation was further tarnished when he was replaced by Mike Pence as Trump's transition team leader. Christie's approval ratings are the lowest in the country, and his family was spotted lounging on a state-owned beach during a government shutdown.\n\n**3.

The standoff has been brewing for weeks, with the House and Senate at odds over the fate of President Barack Obama's signature health care law, also known as Obamacare.\n\n**House Republicans' Plan**\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has proposed a spending bill that includes a one-year delay of the health care law and a repeal of the law's tax on medical devices. However, Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid, have vowed to reject any bill that includes changes to the health care law. The Senate is expected to quickly pass a bill to reject the health care provisions, and the ball will be in the House's court.\n\n**Senate Democrats' Strategy**\n\nSenate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid, are taking a hardline stance against any concessions on the health care law. They believe that the House Republicans will eventually cave in to their demands to pass a clean spending bill, which would keep the government funded without any changes to the health care law. Reid has been the driving force behind this strategy, and his allies in the Senate have rallied behind him.\n\n**Economic Impact of a Shutdown**\n\nThe Washington region, home to the largest concentration of federal workers, could be hit hard by a shutdown. An estimated 700,000 federal workers could be furloughed, with the region's economy losing an estimated $200 million a day. The shutdown could also have a disproportionate impact on the D.C. area, with the federal government accounting for one-third of the local economy. The shutdown could also have ripple effects on the nation's economy, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that a shutdown could cost the nation $1 billion a week.\n\n**Government Services Affected**\n\nA shutdown would affect a range of government services, including:\n\n*   Mail delivery\n*   National parks and monuments\n*   Social Security and Medicare benefits\n*   Small business loans\n*   National Institutes of Health funding\n*   Federal court operations\n\n**Regional Impact**\n\nThe Washington region, home to the largest concentration of federal workers, could be disproportionately affected by a shutdown. The region's economy is already struggling, with the federal payroll down $42 billion annually and federal contracting down $42 billion. A shutdown could exacerbate these issues, with the region's economy already reeling from the effects of sequestration.\n\n**Local", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks. But for the Washington area, this is a tsunami.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 3547}

{"pred": "**Colorectal Cancer Rates Rising in Younger People: A Wake-Up Call for the Medical Community**\n\nA recent study has revealed a concerning trend: one in seven colon and rectal cancers are now diagnosed in people under the age of 50, a significant increase from previous years. Researchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 (15%) of them were under 50. This trend is raising questions about the current guidelines for screening, which recommend starting at age 50.\n\n**Younger Patients Diagnosed with Advanced Cancer**\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, found that younger patients (under 50) were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer, including tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. However, despite having more aggressive cancer, younger patients tended to live longer without a recurrence of cancer. For example, 95% of patients under 50 with localized disease survived for five years, compared to 92% of patients over 50. Similarly, 76% of patients under 50 with advanced cancer survived for five years, compared to 70% of patients over 50.\n\n**Increased Risk of Advanced Cancer in Younger Patients**\n\nYounger patients (under 50) were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer, including tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes (21% vs. 14%) and other organs (50% vs. 14%). This is concerning, as it suggests that younger patients may be diagnosed at a later stage, when cancer is more difficult to treat.\n\n**Treatment Patterns and Outcomes**\n\nYounger patients under 50 were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) than older patients. Despite having more aggressive cancer, younger patients tended to live longer without a recurrence of cancer. For example, 95% of patients under 50 survived for five years, compared to 92% of patients over 50.\n\n**Expert Opinions**\n\nDr. David Weinberg, a cancer expert, noted that the reasons for the increase in colon cancer in younger people are unclear, but may be related to environmental factors, such as diet, smoking, and physical inactivity. Dr. Hendren emphasized that the medical community needs to be aware of the increasing number of young people with colorectal cancer and start looking for signs of the disease in younger patients.\n\n**Recommendations for Screening**\n\n", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

It's \"daring, sophisticated and unforgettably disturbing.\" And \"in scale, scope and the space it offers for a long-awaited moral reckoning, it's nothing less than monumental.\" \"It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is,\" writes Lindsey Bahr at the AP, calling Detroit \"a well-made and evocative film\" jam-packed with \"stomach-churning horror.\" She argues there could be more nuance and perspective. But \"maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with Detroit is the point.\" Chris Klimek says Detroit is \"maddeningly imperfect but still honorable,\" citing \"lightly fictionalized\" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up \"for maximum outrage.\" This is \"messy work, even when it’s done in good faith,\" he writes at NPR.

Peter Howell's main gripe is that the film \"tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people.\" But Detroit still makes for \"urgent viewing,\" he writes at the Toronto Star. Why? \"The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on,\" when \"a person's skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 3798}

{"pred": "**Harnessing the Power of the Universe: A Quest for Energy and Survival**\n\nA recent paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper has revived the concept of a galactic energy-harvesting model proposed by Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. The three stages of galactic expansion, or \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations, are:\n\n1. **Type I**: Harnessing all the resources of a planet (Earth's current level).\n2. **Type II**: Harnessing all the energy of a star (a goal for humans in the near future).\n3. **Type III**: Harnessing all the energy of a galaxy (a hypothetical goal for distant, advanced civilizations).\n\nAccording to Hooper, a civilization must expand its reach to other galaxies to survive the accelerating expansion of the universe. This expansion is caused by dark energy, which is thought to be the driving force behind the universe's growth. As a result, a civilization must capture stars from other galaxies to harness their energy before they become inaccessible.\n\nTo achieve this, a civilization would need to create a swarm of satellites, known as a \"Dyson sphere,\" to collect and harness the energy of a star. This concept was first proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1960 and later by Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker.\" The idea is to create a cloud of satellites that can collect and harness the energy of a star, allowing a civilization to expand its reach and survive the expanding universe.\n\n**Detection of Alien Civilizations**\n\nAstrophysicist Dan Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations would be detectable by their waste heat, which would be visible as a \"spectrum of starlight\" from the star being harvested. This would be detectable in the light signatures of galaxies, particularly those with stars of a certain mass range (about 20-100 times the mass of our sun).\n\n**Detection Methods**\n\nTo detect these civilizations, astronomers would need to look for:\n\n1. **Accelerating stars**: Stars being dragged towards a civilization's star-harvesting galaxy.\n2. **Unusual light signatures**: A change in the light spectrum of a galaxy, indicating the presence of a civilization.\n3. **Dyson spheres**: A cloud of satellites collecting energy from a star.\n\n**The Quest for Energy**\n\nThe universe's expansion is a challenge for civilizations, and the only way to survive is to collect energy from other galaxies.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

The tools, which date back around 320,000 years, show evidence of being made from obsidian, a rare and valuable material, and were likely used for hunting and gathering. The discovery of these tools suggests that early humans in Africa were capable of complex behaviors, such as using pigments to color their bodies, and that these behaviors were present much earlier than previously thought.\n\nThe new discoveries also suggest that the development of complex behaviors in Africa was not a sudden event, but rather a gradual process that occurred over a long period of time.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

In a recent tweet, Trump claimed that his social media use is \"modern day presidential,\" despite criticism from some Republicans that his tweets are beneath the dignity of the office. \n\nTrump has a history of using Twitter to respond to his critics, often in a confrontational manner. In the past, he has tweeted about the media, saying that they are trying to convince him to stop using Twitter, but he has continued to use the platform to express his views. \n\nIn a tweet, Trump also claimed that his use of Twitter is \"modern day presidential,\" and that he will continue to use the platform to communicate directly with the American people.

The airline has reduced the number of boarding lines from five to two, with passengers grouped into five categories: Group 1 (Elite and priority passengers), Group 2 (Silver and credit card holders), and Group 3, 4, and 5 (customers with lower-tier status). The new process will also allow passengers to receive push notifications on their mobile devices when boarding begins, reducing the need for early arrivals at the gate.\n\n**Background and Rationale**\n\nThe new boarding process is a result of customer feedback and testing of various boarding concepts since last year. United's previous process, which used five boarding lines, led to congestion and frustration among passengers. The airline's managing director of global operations strategy, Maria Walter, stated that the new process aims to reduce the time spent waiting in line and improve communication with passengers.\n\n**Key Features of the New Boarding Process**\n\n- The new process uses only two boarding lanes, numbered 1 and 2.\n- Group 1 (Elite and priority passengers) boards in Lane 1, while Group 2 (Silver and credit card holders) boards in Lane 2.\n- The boarding process will be staggered, with passengers in Group 1 boarding first, followed by Group 2, and then Groups 3, 4, and 5.\n- The new process will be implemented nationwide, following successful testing at Los Angeles International Airport.\n- United will also provide push notifications to passengers on their mobile devices when boarding begins, allowing them to stay informed and avoid congestion.\n\n**Benefits and Impact**\n\nThe new boarding process is expected to reduce congestion and alleviate passenger frustration.

Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states.

Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report.

Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

Research conducted by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander and her team at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, has shown that cigarette smoke can alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is linked to the increased ability of the bacteria to evade the reactive oxygen species generated by the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off the infection.\n\nAccording to the study, cigarette smoke exposed MRSA was four times more resistant to the immune system's macrophages, which are responsible for engulfing and killing pathogens. Additionally, the smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are used to kill bacteria. Furthermore, the study found that the smoke-exposed MRSA was more adept at adhering to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to invade and cause infection.\n\nThe study also found that the effects of cigarette smoke on MRSA were more pronounced than those of e-cigarette vapor, with cigarette smoke causing a 10 times greater increase in cell wall changes compared to e-cigarette vapor. This suggests that cigarette smoke has a more significant impact on the virulence of MRSA.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, as they suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms the smoker's respiratory and immune systems but also makes pathogens more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This makes it more challenging for the body to fight off infections, leading to more severe and life-threatening diseases.\n\nThe study's results also highlight the importance of refraining from smoking, as it not only harms the smoker's health but also contributes to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The study's findings emphasize the need for further research into the effects of cigarette smoke on bacterial resistance and the development of new treatments to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Cigarette smoke alters the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses.\n* MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke is four times more resistant to macrophages and antimicrobial peptides.\n* Cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA is more adept at adhering to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to invade and cause infection.\n* The effects of cigarette smoke on MRSA are", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

However, when the study was repeated across 24 language editions of Wikipedia, the results were different.

Two recent announcements from Samsung and Microsoft have sparked controversy over the extent to which these devices are listening to and collecting user data.\n\n**Samsung's Smart TV Policy**\n\nSamsung's new privacy policy for its smart TVs has been met with criticism, with users comparing it to George Orwell's 1984. The policy allows Samsung and its partners to listen to users' conversations, even when the TV is turned off. The company states that users can opt out of voice recognition, but this will prevent them from using the feature. The data collected is used to improve the TV's performance and provide personalized recommendations. Samsung's policy has raised concerns about the potential for mass surveillance, similar to the telescreens in 1984.\n\n**Xbox One's Always-On Listening Mode**\n\nMicrosoft's Xbox One gaming console has also been criticized for its always-on listening mode. The new Kinect, which comes with every Xbox One, is always listening for a specific cue, such as the command \"Xbox On.\" This allows users to turn on the console with voice commands, but also raises concerns about constant surveillance. The new Kinect can recognize and process individual voices, and even detect the heartbeat of users. Microsoft claims that the device is designed with strong privacy protections, but the always-on listening mode has sparked concerns about potential privacy implications.\n\n**Similarities and Differences**\n\nBoth Samsung and Microsoft's policies have drawn comparisons to 1984, with users comparing the devices to telescreens and mass surveillance. However, there are some key differences. Samsung's policy allows users to opt out of voice recognition, while the Xbox One's always-on listening mode is a necessary feature for the console's functionality. Microsoft has also emphasized its commitment to user privacy and has stated that it has implemented safeguards to protect user data.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n- Samsung's smart TV policy allows the company to collect voice data, even when the TV is turned off.\n- The Xbox One's always-on listening mode is designed to provide users with voice control, but raises concerns about constant surveillance.\n- Both devices collect user data to improve their performance and provide personalized recommendations.\n- Users can opt out of voice recognition on Samsung's smart TV, but the Xbox One's always-on listening mode is a necessary feature for the console's functionality.\n- Microsoft has emphasized its commitment to user privacy and has implemented safeguards to protect user data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n", "answers": ["Own a Samsung smart TV?

But intellectual property lawyer Corynne McSherry says it would be nice to see that clarified in Samsung's policy, the Daily Beast reports. \"And I’d definitely like to know whether my words were being transmitted in a secure form,\" she says.

Then Forbes talked with 10 of Ross' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \"penchant for misleading\" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" The magazine delves into Ross' back story, including how, when he first made the Forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $1 billion, \"everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" per a former colleague. When Forbes told Ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, Ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about—in the amount of \"more than $2 billion,\" assets Ross said he put into the trusts sometime \"between the election and [my] nomination.\" When Forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, Ross cited \"privacy issues\"—and the magazine lays out other problems with Ross' story on the supposed $2 billion transfer.

This phenomenon is not only a moral outrage but also a preventable problem. The founder of Lumos, JK Rowling, shares her personal experience of being moved to take action after seeing a disturbing photograph of a child in a caged institution. This sparked the creation of Lumos, a charity dedicated to closing institutions and keeping families together.\n\nLumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050, with the help of international donors and governments. The organization has already seen significant successes in countries like Moldova, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70% since 2007.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

However, the tax has been deemed regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and driving sales to neighboring cities and counties.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed in December 2018 after a public outcry and a significant decline in sales.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Researchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 (15%) of them were under 50. This trend is raising questions about the current guidelines for screening, which recommend starting at age 50.\n\n**Current Guidelines and Findings**\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend that people start screening for colorectal cancer at age 50. However, the study found that younger patients (under 50) are more likely to have advanced cancer and are more likely to be diagnosed with tumors that have spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. Despite this, younger patients tend to live longer without a cancer recurrence, with 5-year survival rates ranging from 21% to 95% depending on the stage of cancer.\n\n**Younger Patients More Likely to Have Advanced Cancer**\n\nThe study found that younger patients (under 50) were more likely to have advanced cancer, with 50% more likely to have cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes and 100% more likely to have cancer that had spread to other organs. However, they also tended to live longer without a cancer recurrence, with 5-year survival rates ranging from 21% to 95%.\n\n**Increased Risk Factors**\n\nResearchers are unsure why the rates of colorectal cancer are increasing in younger adults. However, possible risk factors include a poor diet, smoking, and physical inactivity. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, notes that the reasons for the increase are still unknown, but it may be related to environmental factors.\n\n**Current Recommendations**\n\nWhile the study's findings are concerning, the current guidelines for screening for colorectal cancer remain the same. However, researchers are suggesting that doctors should be more vigilant in screening for colorectal cancer in younger patients, especially those with a family history of the disease. Dr. Hendren, the study's lead author, notes that the current guidelines are not consistently followed, and that more research is needed to determine if screening should start at an earlier age.\n\n**Current Guidelines**\n\nThe current guidelines for screening for colorectal cancer recommend starting at age 50.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The move, which would be the largest buyout in history, was first announced by Musk in a tweet on Tuesday, stating that he had secured funding to take the company private at $420 per share.\n\nAccording to the board's statement, the discussion on taking the company private was initiated by Musk last week, and the board has since met several times to evaluate the proposal.

The three stages of galactic expansion, or \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations, are:\n\n1. **Type I**: Harnessing all the resources of a planet (Earth's current level).\n2. **Type II**: Harnessing all the energy of a star (a goal for humans in the near future).\n3. **Type III**: Harnessing all the energy of a galaxy (a hypothetical goal for advanced civilizations).\n\nAccording to Hooper, a civilization must expand its energy reach to survive as the universe expands and becomes increasingly inaccessible. This is due to the accelerating expansion of the universe, driven by dark energy, which will eventually make stars beyond our local group unobservable and inaccessible. To prevent this, a civilization would need to capture and harness the energy of stars from other galaxies, using a swarm of satellites, or \"Dyson spheres,\" to collect and beam energy back to their home planet.\n\n**The Quest for Energy**\n\nAstrophysicist Freeman Dyson proposed the idea of using a swarm of satellites to collect energy from a star in a 1960 paper. This concept has been explored in science fiction, such as in Olaf Stapledon's novel \"Star Maker\" and in the TV show \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\" Freeman Dyson's idea was to create a shell of satellites around a star to collect its energy, which would be detectable by astronomers as a \"spectrum of starlight\" from the star's radiation.\n\n**Alien Star-Harvesting**\n\nDyson's idea of a shell of satellites has been revived by astrophysicist Dan Hooper, who notes that a civilization would need to collect stars with masses of 20-100 times that of our sun to be useful. These stars would produce a distinct light signature, detectable by astronomers. The civilization would need to collect stars before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe.\n\n**The Search for Aliens**\n\nThe accelerating expansion of the universe will make it increasingly difficult for us to detect signs of alien civilizations. However, if we look for signs of energy harvesting, we may be able to detect the presence of a civilization that has captured stars from other galaxies.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

The island's parliament has passed a law that makes possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) of marijuana a petty offense, punishable by a fine rather than a criminal record. This move is seen as a major victory for Jamaican lawmakers, who have been debating the issue for decades.\n\nThe new law also allows for the cultivation of up to five plants on private premises for personal use, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. Jamaica's Commerce Minister, Anthony Hylton, believes that the cannabis industry has great potential for the island, citing the creation of marijuana-derived products such as \"Canasol,\" which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients.\n\nThe new law is also a significant step forward for the Rastafarian community, who have long been allowed to use marijuana for spiritual purposes. The law will also allow tourists to apply for permits to buy small amounts of Jamaican \"ganja\" for medical purposes.\n\nHowever, the Jamaican government has made it clear that the new law does not mean a free-for-all in the cultivation and export of marijuana. National Security Minister Peter Bunting emphasized that the government remains committed to combating international drug trafficking and will continue to enforce international treaties.\n\nJamaica is not the only country to have relaxed its stance on marijuana. In the US, several states have legalized the use of marijuana for medical and recreational purposes, including Colorado, Washington, and Alaska.

Now on her knees, she spotted her phone lying submerged in a mud puddle, and had an idea: drown it. \"With my thumb in its mouth, I just pushed its head down into the muck,\" she tells the News.

{"pred": "**Ancient Mars: A Wet and Habitable Planet**\n\nRecent studies have revealed that Mars was once a wet and habitable planet, with a significant portion of its surface covered by a massive ocean. The findings, published in the journal Science, suggest that an ancient sea at least 137 meters deep once covered nearly half of the Martian surface, with the water pooling in the northern hemisphere. The ocean, which was at least 20% of the planet's surface, was lost due to the planet's weak gravity, causing the ordinary hydrogen to escape into space. This process led to a higher concentration of deuterium in the Martian water, making it seven times more abundant than on Earth.\n\nThe study, led by NASA scientists, used the most powerful infra-red telescopes to analyze the Martian atmosphere and determine the amount of water that had been lost over time. The team found that the water loss was equivalent to six times the current amount of water in the Martian polar caps. This suggests that the ancient ocean was at least 20% of the Martian surface, covering nearly half of the planet.\n\nThe scientists believe that the water was lost due to the planet's weak gravity, causing the ordinary hydrogen to escape into space.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The case, which has been ongoing for over a decade, revolves around the trademark status of the four-fingered wafer shape of the Kit Kat bar.\n\nNestlé, the manufacturer of Kit Kat, had applied for a European Union trademark for the shape in 2006, but the application was met with opposition from Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury, which argued that the shape was not distinctive enough to be trademarked across the EU. The case has seen several twists and turns, with the EU's lower court initially upholding the trademark in 2012, only to be overturned by the ECJ in 2016.\n\nThe latest ruling by the European Court of Justice means that the EU's trademark office will have to reconsider the case, potentially paving the way for the Kit Kat shape to be removed from the EU trademark register. However, the outcome is not yet clear, as Nestlé may still argue that the shape is distinctive in certain EU countries.\n\n**Background of the Case:**\n\nThe Kit Kat bar was first introduced by Rowntree's in 1935, and was later acquired by Nestlé in 1988. In 2006, Nestlé applied for a trademark for the four-fingered shape, which was granted in 2012.

The researchers discovered that this behavior is present in 16 different bird species and may have evolved independently in different groups, including birds and non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nThe study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in some non-avian dinosaurs, and may have been used for mating or territorial displays. The study's findings are based on the analysis of 52 bird species, including birds and reptiles, and suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization evolved independently in different species.\n\nGary Rydstrom, a sound designer for the movie \"Jurassic Park,\" has also shed light on the sounds of dinosaurs. He used a variety of animal sounds to create the sounds of different dinosaurs, including velociraptors, triceratops, and brachiosaurus. He used a tortoise mating sound for the velociraptors, a baby tortoise sound for the triceratops, and a swan sound for the dilophosaurus. He also used a goose sound for the velociraptors, a horse sound for the brachiosaurus, and a cow sound for the triceratops.\n\nThe study also suggests that the sounds of dinosaurs may have been low-pitched and mumbled, similar to the sounds made by birds and crocodiles.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) grilled Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf over the bank's cross-selling scandal, which led to the creation of millions of fake accounts. The bank has paid $185 million in penalties and fired 5,300 employees involved in the scheme. Sen.

The plane, carrying 239 people, vanished while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, and despite extensive searches, its location remains unknown. The search area is vast, with unpredictable ocean currents and limited data on the plane's flight path. \n\nStatistical tools, particularly Bayesian statistics, can help refine and focus the search for the plane. Bayesian methods allow for the assessment of multiple scenarios, including contradictory ones, and can update the probability of each location based on new information. This approach was used in the 2009 search for Air France Flight 447, which was found after two years of searching.\n\nIn the case of Air France 447, the search area was divided into a grid, with each cell assigned a probability of finding the plane. The team of statisticians from Metron Inc. used Bayesian statistics to update the probability of each location, taking into account the uncertainty of the data. They also considered the historical data of previous crashes and the probability of the plane being found in areas that had already been searched.\n\nThe team's initial search area was 40 miles in diameter, but after re-examining the data, they narrowed it down to a 40-mile radius. However, the search was unsuccessful, and the team made a second attempt, this time taking into account the possibility that the plane's black box may not be emitting a signal. This led to a new area of highest probability, and a team returned to the scene, finding the plane.\n\nThe same approach is being used in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

However, the search area is still vast, and the mystery of the disappearance remains unsolved.\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is complicated by the changing probability of the plane's location.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure?

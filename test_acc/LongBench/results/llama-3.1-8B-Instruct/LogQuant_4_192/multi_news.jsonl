The protesters, who had set up camp on Dilworth Plaza, were served squash soup and water, and chanted slogans such as \"What does democracy look like?

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. This increased resistance allows the bacteria to repel common forms of immune responses, making it more difficult to treat. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be inherited.\n\nIn lab studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be more aggressive and better at invading human cells. In fact, the smoke-exposed MRSA was able to kill more mice than non-exposed MRSA. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, stated that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances.

The initial results showed that Frank Sinatra was the most important person in the English-language world, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, when the study was expanded to include 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, Adolf Hitler took the top spot, with Michael Jackson in second place and Madonna in third.\n\nTo address the issue of Wikipedia's bias towards certain figures, the researchers applied a second method called CheiRank, which measures the number of outgoing links from an article. They then combined PageRank and CheiRank to create a new measure called 2DRank. Using this method, the top 100 most important people in the world were determined, with Frank Sinatra taking the top spot.\n\nHowever, a separate study led by the same researcher, Young-Ho Eom, found that the most influential thinker in the world is actually Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning about the condition, which affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause severe symptoms such as limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech.\n\n**What is AFM?**\n\nAFM is a rare condition that can be caused by various germs, including enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. The exact trigger of AFM is often elusive, and there is no specific treatment.\n\n**Symptoms and Outcomes**\n\nSymptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The condition can be severe, with some patients requiring ventilator support. While some patients have made partial recoveries, only three out of 120 patients who contracted AFM in 2014 have fully recovered.\n\n**Recent Outbreaks**\n\nA cluster of AFM cases was reported in Colorado in 2014, coinciding with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). The CDC issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing. As of November 13, 2014, 88 cases had been verified in 32 states.\n\n**Investigation and Prevention**\n\nThe CDC is collaborating with partners nationally to investigate reported cases, risk factors, and possible etiologies of AFM. While the specific causes of this illness are still under investigation, being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent a number of severe diseases, including poliomyelitis. Prevention of viral infections includes general hygienic measures, such as frequent hand washing with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick persons, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.\n\n**Personal Stories**\n\nSeveral families have shared their personal stories of dealing with AFM.

Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully.

They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The study concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the Shroud of Turin is likely a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the crucifixion of Jesus.

He compared the severity of behaviors such as rape and child molestation to those of lesser severity, such as unwanted touching or comments.\n\nActress Alyssa Milano, a vocal advocate for the #MeToo movement, responded to Damon's comments on Twitter, stating that the \"micro\" behaviors are what make the \"macro\" behaviors possible.

The situation has sparked concerns across the region, with neighboring countries and the international community calling for a swift resolution.\n\n**Background: The Coup**\n\nOn March 22, a group of disgruntled soldiers, led by Captain Amadou Haya Sanogo, overthrew President Amadou Toumani Touré, citing his mishandling of an insurgency in the north by Tuareg rebels. The coup has led to a power vacuum, which the Tuareg rebels have exploited to gain control of the northern half of the country, including the key towns of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu.\n\n**The Tuareg Rebellion**\n\nThe Tuareg rebels, who are primarily from the nomadic Tuareg people, are seeking independence for the northern region, which they call Azawad. The rebels are divided into two groups: the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which wants independence, and Ansar Dine, which is linked to al-Qaeda and wants to impose Sharia law. The rebels have taken advantage of the power vacuum to make rapid advances, with reports of Islamist fighters ransacking bars and imposing Islamic law in the captured towns.\n\n**Regional Response**\n\nWest African leaders, led by Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, have formed a diplomatic emergency committee to pressure the junta to relinquish power.

{"pred": "**Global Efforts to Eradicate Institutionalization of Children**\n\nThe practice of institutionalizing children, where they are taken away from their families and locked in institutions, is a widespread issue affecting 8 million children worldwide. This problem is not only morally reprehensible but also economically unsustainable. According to JK Rowling, founder and president of Lumos, a charity dedicated to closing child institutions and orphanages, the solution to this issue is not just a moral imperative but also makes excellent economic sense.\n\nLumos was founded in 2005 after Rowling came across a disturbing photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. The charity's mission is to shed light on the lives of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. The majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but they are placed in institutions due to a lack of resources, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization on children are severe and long-lasting. They are more likely to experience malnutrition, abuse, and trafficking, and are often left with developmental delays, stunting, and psychological trauma. In fact, research has shown that institutionalized children are far less likely to be educated, physically or mentally well, and are more likely to become dependent on the state in adulthood.\n\nHowever, there is hope for change. Lumos has achieved significant success in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70%, 16%, and 54% respectively. The charity estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 with the right investment in inclusive education and healthcare, support for vulnerable families, and a shift in cultural attitudes towards keeping families together.\n\nInternational donors play a crucial role in this effort, and their funding decisions can greatly influence the support available to children and families. Ending the practice of institutionalization is not only a moral obligation but also makes economic sense, as it is far more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution.\n\nTo raise awareness about this issue, Lumos has launched a social media campaign #Letstalklumos, and JK Rowling has committed to becoming president of the charity for life. With the support of international donors, governments, and individuals, it is possible to create a world where children are not taken away from their families and locked in institutions, but instead thrive within their own families and communities.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer.

She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

The house, which was likely used for gatherings and feasts, features beautifully worked flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch. Analysis of seeds and charred grains recovered from the site will reveal what the people were growing and eating. The house was never a permanent residence, but rather a place for large gatherings, as suggested by the presence of pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit.\n\nThe Marden Henge site itself is a massive enclosure, measuring 15 hectares, and is believed to have been used for status and to show off wealth and power. The site is so vast that it takes 40 minutes to walk from one end to the other.

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue.

The discovery was announced in a study published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nCaihong juji, meaning \"rainbow with a big crest\" in Mandarin, is a crow-sized, bird-like dinosaur with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds. The dinosaur's feathers were found to be iridescent, with microscopic structures called melanosomes that were responsible for pigmentation. The melanosomes were detected using powerful microscopes and were found to be pancake-shaped, similar to those of hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji suggests a more colorful Jurassic world than previously imagined, with the dinosaur's plumage likely used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The dinosaur's body was covered in feathers, with long, linear feathers on its neck and short, sinuous feathers on its head and chest. The tail feathers were particularly striking, with large, pennaceous feathers that formed a frond-shaped tail.\n\nThe study also found that Caihong juji had a unique combination of bird-like and reptilian characteristics, with a bird-like body and a reptilian skull. The dinosaur's forelimbs were proportionally short, but its hindlimbs were highly elongated, with a hallux that was proportionally smaller than that of most other basal paravians.\n\nThe researchers used scanning electron microscopy to analyze the nanostructures in the dinosaur's feathers and found that they were similar to those found in modern bird feathers. The nanostructures were platelet-shaped and were organized into sheets, which is a characteristic of iridescent feathers. The study suggests that Caihong juji's feathers may have had a rainbow glimmer, with the observed pigments giving the dinosaur a shimmering appearance.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and the diversity of dinosaur plumage. It also highlights the importance of studying fossilized feathers to understand the biology and behavior of ancient animals. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of birds and the development of feathers, and provide a new perspective on the diversity of dinosaur plumage.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji was made possible by the exceptional preservation of the fossil, which included the dinosaur's feathers and bones.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

However, critics argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families, and has driven sales outside city limits.\n\nBusinesses, such as Costco, have seen a significant decline in sales of sugary drinks, with a case of Gatorade increasing from $15.99 to $26.33, a 64% increase. Retailers have responded by posting signs directing customers to locations outside the city limits where they can buy the products without the tax. This has led to a loss of revenue for the city, with some businesses reporting a 34% decline in sales.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, exempting sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages. Starbucks, for example, rejected the tax, citing its inconsistency.\n\nSimilar to Seattle, Cook County in Illinois repealed its sugary drink tax in December 2018, just two months after its implementation, due to a public outcry and significant losses in sales. The tax was seen as regressive and drove customers to shop outside the county limits.\n\nA bill to bring a sugary drink tax statewide in Washington has been re-introduced, but local businesses are concerned about the potential impact on their sales. Some residents, however, support the tax, citing its potential to improve public health and reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.\n\nCritics of the tax argue that it is a form of \"nanny statism\" and that the city should focus on providing education and incentives rather than imposing taxes. They also point out that the tax is not effective in achieving its intended goal of reducing sugar consumption, as people are simply shopping elsewhere to avoid the tax.\n\nOverall, the sugary drink tax in Seattle has been a failure, with significant losses in revenue and a decline in sales. The tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency and its impact on low-income families. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen whether the tax will be repealed or modified to address the concerns of residents and businesses.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

However, it was later discovered that Martinez was actually a contestant on the reality TV show \"The Bachelor\" and was not missing after all.\n\n**Cannabis Industry and Missing Persons**\n\nThe cannabis industry has been identified as a contributing factor to the high rate of missing persons in Humboldt County. Many people come to the area to work in the industry, often leaving town to work on remote mountains with no cell phone service, making it difficult for family members to track their whereabouts. Law enforcement officials have stated that many of these cases are not suspicious, but rather individuals who have chosen to lay low for a period of time.\n\n**Missing Children**\n\nHumboldt County also has a high rate of missing children reports, with an average of 490 reports per 100,000 residents between 2000 and 2016, compared to the state average of 280.

According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people.

Despite her initial denials, sources confirm that she is approximately three months pregnant with her boyfriend Jionni LaValle's child. This news comes as a surprise, as Snooki has been open about her desire to get married and have children, but her partying lifestyle may pose a challenge to her ability to provide for her child.\n\nThe news of Snooki's pregnancy has sparked concerns about the potential risks of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) due to her history of heavy drinking. FAS is a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy, leading to physical and neurodevelopmental problems. The condition can cause growth deficiency, facial abnormalities, and central nervous system damage, which can result in behavioral and cognitive issues.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FAS is the most severe form of FASD, and it is estimated to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1000 live births in the United States. The risk of FAS is higher when a pregnant woman consumes more than four standard drinks per day, and the condition can be prevented by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\n\nSnooki's pregnancy has also raised questions about her ability to balance her partying lifestyle with her new role as a mother. In a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Snooki admitted to overdrinking and waking up in strange places, including a garbage can. She also confessed that she doesn't want to be a role model, but her actions may set a bad example for her child.\n\nIn related news, the CDC has reported that FASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe. The condition can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, leading to secondary disabilities such as mental health problems, disrupted school experience, and trouble with the law. However, with early interventions and supportive services, these disabilities can be ameliorated.\n\nOverall, Snooki's pregnancy has raised awareness about the risks of FAS and the importance of responsible drinking during pregnancy.

Myrna Arias, who worked for Intermex from February to May 2014, claims that her boss, John Stubits, required her to install the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone, which tracked her every move, including her driving speed and routes taken.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours, likening it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet. Stubits allegedly admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged about knowing her driving speed at specific moments. When Arias uninstalled the app to protect her privacy, Stubits scolded her and told her that she should tolerate the intrusion because Intermex was paying her more than her previous employer.\n\nArias claims that she was fired a few weeks later, and that Intermex's actions were a violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy. Her attorney, Gail Glick, stated that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a legitimate business interest, but that Intermex's actions went beyond that and interfered with Arias' ability to earn a livelihood.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Intermex's president and CEO, Robert Lisy, made a phone call to Arias' previous employer, NetSpend, which led to her termination from that job as well. Arias is seeking an injunction and damages for invasion of privacy, retaliation, labor code violations, intentional interference with contract, wrongful termination, and unfair business practices.\n\nThe Xora app, now known as ClickSoftware Solution, is a web-based management application that enables office staff to track employees' locations, dispatch daily worker orders, and analyze driving routes and times. The app is available on over 140 different types of devices and is offered on a monthly basis for around $1 per user.\n\nThis case highlights the importance of employee privacy and the need for employers to balance their legitimate business interests with their employees' right to privacy.

Arias started researching the app, then called Xora—its website touts the app's ability to let employers \"instantly see where their employees are and where they have been\"—and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called. Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says.

President Barack Obama has also threatened to veto any bill that includes these provisions.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a hardline stance against the ACA, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is determined to block any attempts to gut or delay the law. Reid has taken a tough stance, urging Obama not to engage in direct negotiations with Republicans and warning that any concessions on a short-term funding bill would lead to bigger concessions on the debt ceiling.\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, is expected to be severely impacted by a shutdown. Local economist Stephen Fuller estimates that the region could lose $200 million a day and see over 700,000 jobs affected. The shutdown would also impact tourism, with federally funded attractions such as the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo likely to be closed.\n\nFederal services would also be disrupted, including the processing of new applications for benefits such as Medicare, Social Security, and child-care subsidies. Child-care centers in federal agencies would close, and child-care workers would be sent home. Mail would still be delivered, but planes could be delayed due to the lack of \"nonessential\" support staff.\n\nLocal governments in the Washington region are preparing for the worst, setting aside funds to mitigate the impact of a shutdown. Maryland officials estimate they would lose $5 million a day in income tax revenue, while Prince George's County officials say they could lose $270,000 daily.\n\nAs the deadline for passing a spending bill approaches, lawmakers are scrambling to find a solution.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

It is estimated to be 5-10 times the mass of Earth and has a highly elliptical orbit that takes 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine was made by a team of researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006. Brown and his colleague, Konstantin Batygin, used mathematical and computer modeling to infer the existence of the planet, which they believe is responsible for the unusual motion of small, icy bodies in the outer solar system.\n\nThe researchers have not directly observed the planet, but they are confident that it exists based on the gravitational influence it has on the smaller objects. They estimate that the planet is about two to four times the diameter of Earth and is likely an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Mike Brown argues that Pluto's demotion was necessary for the good of science and that it is now an interesting member of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.\n\nBrown believes that the controversy over Pluto's status will eventually die down, and he hopes that the New Horizons mission to Pluto will mark the beginning of a new era of exploration of the Kuiper Belt. He also notes that the discovery of Planet Nine has the potential to rewrite the textbooks and provide new insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, and astronomers are hopeful that it will be detected within the next few years. If confirmed, the discovery of Planet Nine would be a significant milestone in the field of astronomy and would provide new opportunities for scientists to study the outer reaches of our solar system.\n\nIn related news, NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has cautioned that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system, and that the Sagan rule of \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\" should be applied.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over a period of five years, found that those who experienced the largest fluctuations in weight had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease (CHD), is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased. This can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, emphasized the importance of maintaining weight loss over time. \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off,\" he said. \"Many people are motivated to lose weight, but then they feel they can take it easy. This information can be used as motivation to keep the weight off.\"\n\nThe study found that individuals with CHD who experienced large fluctuations in weight over a period of 4.7 years were at a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death compared to those with little change in body weight. The researchers also found a link between changes in body weight and increased risk of new-onset diabetes.\n\nWhile the study is observational and cannot prove cause-and-effect, the findings suggest that weight fluctuation may be a concern for people with CHD. Dr. Bangalore and his team recommend further investigation into how to help Americans keep weight off and reduce the risk of heart disease.\n\nIn summary, yo-yo dieting may have serious health implications for people with coronary artery disease, increasing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

The issue occurred on Wednesday when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The valve, which regulates the flow of ammonia coolant, reached a pre-set temperature limit, causing the shutdown.\n\nAccording to NASA, the crew was never in any danger, and the situation is not considered a life-threatening emergency.

He spent hours crafting a special bulletin, which was titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE.\" The document warned of a powerful hurricane with unprecedented strength, predicting that \"MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS. PERHAPS LONGER.\" It also predicted widespread destruction, including roof and wall failure, snapped or uprooted trees, and water shortages that would lead to \"HUMAN SUFFERING INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS.\"\n\nRicks' document was a stark contrast to the more routine weather forecasts typically issued by the NWS.

Ricks' own experiences growing up in the Lower Ninth Ward, which was devastated by previous hurricanes, informed his decision to issue such a dire warning.\n\nThe response to the storm was devastating, with widespread destruction and loss of life. Ricks has said that he would rather have been wrong in his prediction, but his local expertise and experience told him that this was the \"big one.\" The storm's impact was so severe that it led to a re-evaluation of the NWS's approach to weather forecasting, with a greater emphasis on using bold and direct language to convey the urgency of the situation.\n\nToday, Ricks' bulletin is on display at the Smithsonian Museum of American History, a testament to the importance of his work in warning the public about the impending disaster.

{"pred": "**Rising Colorectal Cancer Rates Among Younger Adults: A Growing Concern**\n\nA recent study has shed light on a concerning trend in the United States: colorectal cancer rates are increasing among younger adults, with one in seven cases diagnosed in individuals under the age of 50. This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults.\n\nAccording to the study, which analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011, nearly 15% of patients were under 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment.\n\nResearchers found that younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) compared to older patients. Despite having more advanced disease, younger patients had a higher five-year survival rate, with 95.1% surviving localized disease, 76% surviving regional disease, and 21.3% surviving distant disease.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. She noted that the medical community should be aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool.\n\nExperts agree that the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unclear, but potential contributing factors may include environmental influences, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, suggested that the increase may be due to a combination of these factors.\n\nWhile the study raises questions about whether screening guidelines should be altered to start at a younger age, experts caution that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of such a change. Dr. David Weinberg, chairman of medicine at the Fox Chase Cancer Center, noted that starting screening too early may result in a low yield of cancer diagnoses.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the medical community, with Dr. Hendren warning that the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors who will require long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising rates of colorectal cancer among younger adults are a growing concern that requires attention from the medical community.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, has revealed a treasure trove of artefacts and bones, including the earliest known evidence of human interaction with megafauna.\n\n**The Discovery**\n\nThe site was discovered by chance when archaeologist Giles Hamm and local elder Clifford Coulthard were surveying the area. Hamm, a consultant archaeologist and doctoral student at La Trobe University, said that the discovery was made when Coulthard needed to use the restroom and stumbled upon a rock shelter with a blackened roof, indicating human activity.\n\n**Significance of the Site**\n\nThe Warratyi rock shelter is significant because it shows that Aboriginal Australians settled the arid interior of the country around 49,000 years ago, 10,000 years earlier than previously thought. The site also contains the first reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum, a giant wombat-like species that is now extinct.\n\n**Artefacts and Fossils**\n\nThe excavations at the site have yielded over 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile. The artefacts include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre, and gypsum pigments, which suggest that early humans developed these technologies locally. The fossils include the remains of a giant bird and a Diprotodon, which were likely brought to the site by humans.\n\n**Dating the Site**\n\nThe site has been dated using optical dating of quartz grains, which suggests that the artefacts and fossils are between 49,000 and 46,000 years old. Radiocarbon dating of burnt eggshells has also confirmed that the site is at least 45,000 years old.\n\n**Impact on Our Understanding of Human History**\n\nThe discovery of the Warratyi rock shelter has significant implications for our understanding of human history in Australia. It challenges the idea that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world and suggests that they were able to adapt to the arid environment of the Australian interior.\n\n**Debate and Controversy**\n\nThe discovery has sparked debate among archaeologists, with some questioning the accuracy of the dating methods used.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The movie begins with a historical primer on the mass migration of African-Americans from the rural south to the urban north and west, and the subsequent white flight to the suburbs, which led to the racial tensions that culminated in the riots.\n\nThe film follows the story of Larry Reed, a young singer with the group The Dramatics, and his friend Fred Temple, who take refuge at the Algiers Motel during the riots.

According to Kardashev's model, there are three levels of technologically advanced civilizations: Level I, which harnesses all a planet's resources; Level II, which harnesses all a star's radiation; and Level III, which harnesses all a galaxy's resources. Hooper's paper suggests that advanced civilizations would need to capture stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe.\n\nThe universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, causing stars beyond our Local Group of galaxies to fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making them unobservable and inaccessible. Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations would use a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to capture and harvest energy from stars. These satellites would be made up of millions of solar-powered satellites that would hover around a star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to a nearby planet.\n\nThis concept is not new, as science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described similar structures in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker.\" Physicist Freeman Dyson also proposed similar structures in a scientific paper in 1960, suggesting that advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems to capture their star's energy. Dyson spheres would be made up of individual solar-collecting satellites, known as statites, which would hover in space and collect energy from a star.\n\nWhile humans are still in the early stages of harnessing energy from our own star, advanced civilizations millions of years older than ours may have already reached Level III, harnessing the energy of entire galaxies. Hooper suggests that we may be able to detect these civilizations by looking for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away. However, our current instruments are not precise enough to detect these signatures, and it may be a challenge to develop the technology to do so before our sun becomes another star in a distant civilization's collection.\n\nThe concept of harnessing energy from distant stars and the search for alien life continues to fascinate scientists and science fiction authors alike. While we may not be able to achieve Level III civilization status in the near future, the idea of exploring the universe and harnessing its energy is an exciting and ongoing area of research.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

{"pred": "Recent archaeological discoveries in East Africa have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have uncovered evidence of a significant shift in toolmaking and trading networks among early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This period marks the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, a time of great change and innovation in human history.\n\nThe discoveries suggest that early humans were able to adapt to a changing climate by developing more advanced tools and technologies, such as smaller, more specialized stone tools and the use of obsidian, a volcanic glass that was transported from distant locations. The presence of obsidian and other exotic materials indicates that early humans were able to establish long-distance trading networks, exchanging goods and ideas with other groups.\n\nThe findings also suggest that early humans were able to develop complex social networks, with evidence of the exchange of brightly colored pigments, such as red ochre, which was used for symbolic purposes. This level of cultural complexity is seen as a key indicator of modern human behavior.\n\nThe discoveries challenge the long-held view that modern human behavior and technology emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago, with the \"human revolution.\" Instead, it appears that early humans were developing complex behaviors and technologies much earlier, starting in groups that predated the emergence of Homo sapiens.\n\nThe Olorgesailie discoveries are significant because they provide evidence of technological innovation and cultural complexity in Africa, rather than in other parts of the world. The findings suggest that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments and develop new technologies and social structures, laying the foundation for the emergence of modern human societies.\n\nThe research team, led by paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, suggests that the development of complex behaviors and technologies was driven by the need to adapt to a changing climate, which led to increased mobility and the exchange of ideas and goods between groups. This level of social complexity is seen as a key factor in the emergence of modern human societies.\n\nThe discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the emergence of modern human behavior. They suggest that the development of complex behaviors and technologies was a gradual process that occurred over hundreds of thousands of years, rather than a sudden revolution.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

However, this explanation was met with widespread criticism and ridicule on social media.\n\nCritics argue that the removal of the headphone jack is a move driven by hubris, arrogance, and greed, rather than a desire to innovate and improve the user experience. They point out that the headphone jack is the most successful and widespread audio standard in the world, and that there is no technological excuse for its removal. Moreover, music does not sound better over a Lightning cable or wireless technology, and users are forced to purchase expensive and unwieldy dongles to use their existing headphones.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has also raised concerns about the impact on other devices that rely on the jack, such as Square's credit card dongle, temperature sensors, light meters, thermal imaging cameras, and personal breathalyzers. Users are now forced to either adapt to Apple's proprietary Lightning connector or abandon their existing devices.\n\nThe decision has been seen as a step backward for Apple, which has traditionally been known for its \"it just works\" mantra. The company's walled garden approach has been criticized for making it difficult for users to use their devices with a wide range of accessories.

Nine activists were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, but were released on bail hours later.

The surgery aimed to give him a more normal appearance, allowing him to fit in with his peers and boost his confidence.\n\nThe procedure involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs, shaping it into ear frameworks, and grafting them onto his head. The new ears were designed to match the shape of his mother's ears, which were used as a template. The surgery was a success, and Kieran was delighted with the result, exclaiming \"Wow!\" when he saw his new ears for the first time.\n\nThe surgery is a major operation, but it brings a significant improvement in quality of life for children with microtia. According to Bulstrode, it can alter a child's whole trajectory in life by improving their confidence and self-esteem. Kieran's parents, David and Louise, were overjoyed with the result, saying they couldn't have wished for a better outcome.\n\nThe surgery is not without its challenges, and Kieran will need a follow-up operation in six months to make his ears stand out from his scalp more. However, the long-term prospects for Kieran's new ears are promising, as they are made from cartilage and are expected to last.\n\nResearchers at the University College London Institute for Child Health are working on a new approach to ear reconstruction using stem cells from a child's own fat tissue. This method is expected to be less invasive than the current procedure and could revolutionize the field of reconstructive surgery in the future.\n\nFor now, Kieran is enjoying his new ears and the confidence boost that comes with it. He is looking forward to wearing sunglasses and earphones like his friends and fitting in with his peers. The surgery has given him a new lease on life, and he is grateful for the opportunity to look and feel more like everyone else.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

The raids, which took place in August 2011, are the second time Gibson has been targeted by the government, following a similar raid in 2009.\n\nThe Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law amended in 2008 to include plants, is at the center of the controversy. The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, despite being aware of the risks involved. Gibson, however, denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe case has sparked debate in the guitar world, with some, like Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the Lacey Act as a necessary measure to prevent illegal logging. Others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature, which could force guitar builders to prove the provenance of wood acquired decades ago.\n\nThe raids have also had a significant impact on the guitar industry, with dealers like George Gruhn of Nashville's George Gruhn Guitars warning of a \"nightmare\" scenario where owners may be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The law also covers the trade in vintage instruments, which has led to a decline in Gruhn's business.\n\nIn a separate development, the Internet Archive has been collecting data from Alexa Internet since 1996, adding it to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. This data provides a valuable resource for researchers and historians, offering a snapshot of the internet's past.\n\nIn the Gibson case, the government's efforts to enforce the Lacey Act have been defended by the EIA's Andrea Johnson, who sees the law as a necessary measure to reduce illegal logging and promote responsible wood sourcing. The outcome of the case will likely set a precedent for the guitar industry and the enforcement of the Lacey Act.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

{"pred": "**Ancient Mars: A Wet and Habitable Planet**\n\nRecent studies have revealed that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, with a massive ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere. The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was approximately a mile deep in some areas and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding, announced by NASA scientists, significantly rewrites the planet's ancient history, contradicting previous assumptions that water was only occasionally present on Mars.\n\nThe research team used infrared telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere and analyze the isotopic composition of water molecules. They found that the water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, indicating that Mars lost a vast amount of water in the past. By calculating the concentration of deuterium, the scientists estimated that the planet's water loss was equivalent to more than six times the amount currently locked up in the ice caps. This would have created a global ocean with a depth of 137 meters, but it's believed that the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the planet. The longer water persisted on Mars, the more likely it is that it provided a habitable environment for life to originate or proliferate. While it's not clear whether life actually existed on Mars, the evidence suggests that the planet was at least habitable in the distant past.\n\nThe study also found that the ordinary hydrogen in Martian water has been leaking into space over time, leading to a higher proportion of deuterium in the planet's water. This process can be used to estimate the amount of water that once existed on Mars, which would have been enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of 450 feet (137 meters) if it had been evenly distributed.\n\nWhile the exact amount of water on ancient Mars is still a topic of debate, the evidence continues to mount that the planet was once much wetter and warmer than it is today. This, combined with increasing signs of a hospitable chemical environment, strengthens the notion that life might have once existed on Mars. The search for life on the Red Planet will continue with the upcoming European Space Agency's Exomars rover mission in 2018, which will look for chemical signatures of life in the Martian soil.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has dismissed appeals from both companies, sending the case back to the EU's trademark office for review. The ruling means that the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must reconsider its 2012 decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark on the shape of the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit.\n\nThe dispute began in 2002 when Nestlé applied for a trademark for the shape of KitKat in Europe. Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury, objected to the application, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be trademarked. The case has been ongoing for over a decade, with various appeals and court rulings.\n\nThe ECJ's decision was based on the fact that Nestlé failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive. However, the court also dismissed Mondelez's appeal against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016. The outcome leaves open the possibility that the EUIPO could preserve protection for KitKat's shape, taking into account new evidence of its distinctiveness in more countries.\n\nThe case has significant implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The dispute has also been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has featured in Britain's Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat.\n\nThe ruling does not affect the trademark status of KitKat in individual countries, as Nestlé still holds national trademarks for the shape in some countries, including France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. However, the decision marks a significant setback for Nestlé's efforts to secure a Europe-wide trademark for the shape.\n\nThe case is not the only example of a trademark dispute between the two companies. Mondelez has also successfully trademarked the shape of its Toblerone chocolate bar, while Nestlé has objected to a trademark application by Cadbury for the purple color used to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.\n\nThe outcome of the case is not yet clear, and it is possible that Nestlé could reapply for a trademark for the shape of KitKat with new evidence of its distinctiveness in more countries.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex, may not have roared like they are often depicted in movies and popular culture. According to researchers, the sounds made by dinosaurs were likely more similar to those of birds, with a low, throaty whoosh of air, often referred to as \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" This type of vocalization is characterized by a low-frequency sound produced by pushing air into an esophageal pouch rather than exhaling through an open beak.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization, which is often used for mating or territorial displays. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, a physiology professor at Midwestern University, noted that the association between large body size and closed-mouth vocalization is due to physics. The inflation of an elastic cavity, such as the esophageal pouch, requires a certain level of lung pressure, which is more easily achieved in larger body sizes.\n\nThe researchers believe that some dinosaurs, particularly those with large body sizes, may have made closed-mouthed vocalizations similar to those of birds today, possibly during mating displays. However, no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like.\n\nThe study's findings offer a new perspective on the sounds of the ancient world, suggesting that the Jurassic world may have been a more subdued and bird-like place. Future research by the collaboration will integrate information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to understand the sounds of extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors.\n\nIn a related article, sound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the original \"Jurassic Park\" film, revealed that he used a variety of animal sounds to create the iconic dinosaur noises, including a baby elephant for the T. rex roar, a tortoise for the velociraptor's mating call, and a goose for the raptor's hiss. Rydstrom's creative approach to sound design has become legendary in the film industry, and his work on \"Jurassic Park\" continues to inspire new generations of sound designers.\n\nIn another article, researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and other institutions used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and other reptilian groups.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The data was then fed into a computer model that matched patterns of brain activity with features of the videos, such as colors, shapes, and movements. The model was able to reconstruct a continuous, albeit blurry, version of the video based on the brain activity.\n\nThis technology has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the brain and its functions.

Despite extensive searches, the plane's fate remains unknown. However, statisticians and experts are using Bayesian statistics, a mathematical technique developed by 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, to help locate the plane.\n\n**Bayesian Statistics: A Powerful Tool**\n\nBayesian statistics is a method of updating probabilities based on new information. It allows researchers to consider multiple scenarios, including contradictory ones, and combine them to find the most likely solution. This approach has been used in various searches, including the location of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009.\n\n**The Air France Flight 447 Case Study**\n\nIn 2009, Air France Flight 447 disappeared while flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. Despite finding debris, the plane's wreckage was not located until 2011. Statisticians from Metron Inc. used Bayesian statistics to help locate the plane. They analyzed historical data, assessed the likelihood of various mechanical failures, and updated their model based on new information. Their probability map helped narrow down the search area, and eventually, the plane was found.\n\n**Applying Bayesian Statistics to the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Search**\n\nColleen Keller, a senior analyst at Metron Inc., was part of the team that helped locate Air France Flight 447. She believes that Bayesian statistics can be applied to the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 search. However, she notes that the search area is vast, and the currents in the Indian Ocean are unpredictable, making it a challenging task.\n\n**Challenges and Uncertainties**\n\nKeller emphasizes that Bayesian statistics is not a guarantee of success. The search area is enormous, and the plane may be at the bottom of the ocean, making it difficult to detect. Even finding debris may not mean finding the bulk of the plane. Keller believes that it's very likely that the plane is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and may never be found.\n\n**The Importance of Bayesian Statistics**\n\nBayesian statistics provides a flexible and adaptable approach to solving complex problems. It allows researchers to update their models based on new information and combine contradictory views. This approach has been used in various searches, including the location of sunken treasure, missing submarines, and plane-crash debris.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 remains a mystery, and the use of Bayesian statistics", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time. They changed their findings, and presto, the plane was found.

The vehicle was on Autopilot mode with adaptive cruise control set to minimum at the time of the collision.\n\nAccording to Tesla, the crash was severe due to the condition of the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier designed to reduce impact into a concrete lane divider. The barrier had been crushed in a prior accident 11 days before Huang's fatal crash and had not been replaced. Tesla stated that this level of damage to a Model X has never been seen in any other crash.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the accident, and Tesla has released a statement regarding the incident. The company emphasized that Autopilot does not prevent all accidents but makes them less likely to occur. Tesla also pointed out that the safety level of a Tesla vehicle is 3.7 times safer than non-autonomous cars, and if the current safety level were applied to all vehicles, it would save approximately 900,000 lives per year.\n\nHuang's family has come forward, stating that he had complained to the dealership about the Autopilot system veering towards the same barrier on multiple occasions, with the issue being reported 7-10 times. The family also provided an invoice to investigators, which the California Highway Patrol (CHP) has been acting on.\n\nTesla's data shows that the stretch of highway where the accident occurred has been driven with Autopilot engaged over 85,000 times since 2015, with over 200 successful trips per day. The company also released photos of the crash attenuator in its proper condition and the day before the accident, which was damaged.\n\nThe California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) has released a statement saying that replacement work was scheduled for the barrier, but storms delayed the fix. The incident has raised concerns about the safety of Autopilot and autonomous vehicles, following a recent fatal accident involving an Uber autonomous vehicle in Arizona.", "answers": ["The Tesla Model X that slammed into a highway barrier in California last week and killed the 38-year-old Apple engineer at the wheel had been on autopilot at the time of the crash, Tesla confirms in a blog post. But the company says driver Walter Huang \"received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive,\" adding that \"the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\" Tesla also laid some blame on state highway officials, asserting that \"the reason this crash was so severe is because the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced.\" The fact that the vehicle was on autopilot is likely to be controversial because, as ABC News notes, driver Huang had reportedly been concerned about it. His brother told KGO that Huang had brought his Model X back to the dealership complaining that when he used the feature, the car kept swerving toward the very same barrier that it eventually struck in the fatal collision.

This event is even more special as it coincides with a \"Supermoon,\" where the moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon.\n\n**Visibility and Timing**\n\nThe total lunar eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, with the best viewing times in the evening sky. The eclipse will begin at 11:48am UTC and reach its maximum at 1:30pm UTC. For viewers in eastern North America, it will be necessary to wake up early to catch the partial eclipse.\n\n**Supermoon Trilogy**\n\nThis is the third supermoon of the winter season, with the first two occurring on December 3 and January 1, 2018. The supermoons appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than regular full moons and are a rare occurrence.\n\n**Viewing Options**\n\nFor those who cannot view the event in person, there are several options available. The Virtual Telescope project will provide a livestream of the January 1 supermoon rise over Rome's skyline and the January 31 eclipse from Australia. Additionally, viewers can watch the event from the comfort of their own homes, as it is safe to view with the naked eye.\n\n**Photography Tips**\n\nFor those who want to capture the event, NASA's senior photographer Bill Ingalls recommends using a DSLR camera with a daylight white balance to adjust for the sunlight reflected off the moon.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.

The elections are seen as a crucial step towards establishing a new government and determining the country's future direction.\n\n**Islamist Groups Expected to Consolidate Gains**\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party is expected to consolidate its gains in the final round of voting, which covers nine provinces, including the North and South Sinai governorates. The Brotherhood has already taken the lead in the first two rounds of voting, with the conservative Nour party coming in second. Analysts predict that the Brotherhood may win a clear majority of seats in the new parliament, which could give it significant influence over the country's government.\n\n**Mubarak's Trial Resumes**\n\nMeanwhile, Mubarak's trial resumed on January 2, with the chief prosecutor accusing the ousted leader of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensure his son's succession. The prosecutor, Mustafa Suleiman, described Mubarak as a corrupt man whose lust for power will forever tarnish his legacy. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the crackdown on the popular uprising that forced him out of office.\n\n**Prosecutor Demands Harsh Penalty for Mubarak**\n\nSuleiman demanded that Mubarak be given the harshest penalty, including the death penalty, if convicted of complicity in the killing of protesters. The trial is expected to continue for three days, with the prosecution presenting its case against Mubarak and 10 other defendants, including his two sons and his security chief.\n\n**Economic Growth Slows**\n\nThe country's economic growth has slowed due to the unrest and instability following Mubarak's ouster. Foreign-currency reserves have declined by 44% to $20.2 billion, and the benchmark EGX 30 stock index has lost 49% last year, making it the third-worst performer among world markets.\n\n**New Parliament to Face Challenges**\n\nThe new parliament, which is expected to be dominated by Islamist groups, will face significant challenges in forming a new government and addressing the country's economic and social issues. The military rulers have said they will retain authority over the hiring and firing of the prime minister, which could lead to a confrontation with the new parliament", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

According to police, Altahan was driving westbound on Route 4 when her GPS device suddenly directed her to turn around, as she had passed her intended destination. In a swift reaction, Altahan left the road, and her car ended up dangling from the telephone pole across from Sugar & Spice Restaurant.\n\nFortunately, neither Altahan nor her passenger was injured in the incident. A witness at the nearby miniature golf course reported seeing the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended from the pole. The Rutland City Fire Department and State Police responded to the scene, with State Police releasing a statement confirming the details of the incident.\n\nThis unusual accident serves as a reminder of the importance of carefully following GPS directions and not reacting impulsively to sudden changes in navigation.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP.

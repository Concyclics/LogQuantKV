In the letter, he asked, \"If my rifle took away people's lives, then can I be the one to blame?\" \n\nThe letter, written on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, was signed with a wavering hand by the man who described himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov.\" The letter was received by the Russian Orthodox Church's Patriarch, Kirill, who replied that the Church has a definite position on the matter: \"When weapons serve to defend the country, the Church supports both the creators and the soldiers who use it.\" \n\nMikhail Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, stated that her father was baptized at the age of 91 and was later baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church.

{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs**\n\nRecent studies have revealed a disturbing link between cigarette smoke and the virulence of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have discovered that cigarette smoke can alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is further exacerbated by the fact that cigarette smoke can also make MRSA more aggressive, allowing it to invade human cells more easily.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at the University of California, San Diego, cigarette smoke acts as an alarm to the bacteria, triggering a stress response that makes it more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is not limited to the bacteria's cell walls, but also extends to its ability to adhere to human cells, making it more difficult to kill.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was four times more resistant to the immune system's defenses compared to non-exposed bacteria. Furthermore, the study revealed that the more smoke-exposed the bacteria, the more resistant it became to the immune system's defenses.\n\nIn addition, the study found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are used by the immune system to kill bacteria. This resistance was also seen in lab cultures, where the smoke-exposed MRSA was able to invade human cells more easily.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke can make MRSA more aggressive and resistant to the immune system, making it a significant contributing factor to the spread of the superbug. This is a concerning discovery, especially considering that cigarette smoke is known to have a multitude of negative effects on the respiratory system and immune system.\n\nThe study's findings also suggest that cigarette smoke can be a contributing factor to the spread of MRSA, making it a significant public health concern.

It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

The study used two methods: PageRank, which measures the importance of a page based on the number of links pointing to it, and CheiRank, which measures the importance of a page based on the number of links it refers to. By combining these two methods, the researchers found that Frank Sinatra is the most important person in the world, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, this result was deemed skewed due to the large number of scientific pages that link to Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist who developed the system of taxonomy that is still used today.\n\nHowever, when the researchers used a different method, CheiRank, which measures the number of links a page refers to, they found that Carl Linnaeus is actually the most influential person in the world. This is because Linnaeus' system of taxonomy is used to classify and name many species, resulting in a vast number of pages linking to him.\n\nThe study also found that the most influential people in the world are often those who have developed systems or concepts that are widely used and referenced. This is evident in the case of Carl Linnaeus, who developed the system of taxonomy that is still widely used today. Similarly, Sir Isaac Newton's famous quote \"standing on the shoulders of giants\" highlights the importance of building on the work of others.\n\nIn another study, a team led by Jasleen Kaur, Filippo Radicchi, and Filippo Menczer found that the most influential person in the world is actually Karl Marx, based on the number of references to his work in academic papers.

This issue has been a long-standing problem, with many people turning a blind eye to the suffering of these children. However, thanks to the efforts of organizations like Lumos, a significant reduction in the number of children in institutions is possible.\n\nLumos, founded by J.K. Rowling, aims to eradicate the practice of institutionalizing children by 2050. The organization has made significant progress in countries like Moldova, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70% since 2007. Similar results have been achieved in Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has dropped by 54%, and in the Czech Republic, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 16% in the past year.\n\nThe problem of institutionalizing children is not just a moral issue, but also a critical one. Children in institutions are more likely to suffer from malnutrition, abuse, and poverty. In fact, research has shown that institutionalized children are more likely to be malnourished, have lower educational outcomes, and are more likely to be abused or trafficked.\n\nHowever, the good news is that this problem can be solved. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050.

The fossil is exceptionally well-preserved, with the dinosaur's feathers and bones still intact.\n\nThe Caihong juji is a small, two-legged carnivorous dinosaur that weighed around a pound and had a crested head, similar to a Velociraptor. However, unlike the Velociraptor, Caihong juji had iridescent feathers, which were likely used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The researchers were able to determine the color of the feathers by analyzing the melanosomes, which are the structures that contain the pigment in the feathers. The melanosomes were found to be organized in a way that would have created a rainbow-like effect, similar to that of hummingbirds. The researchers believe that the iridescent feathers were likely used for display purposes, but the exact function is still unknown.\n\nThe researchers also found that the dinosaur had a bird-like body, with a short, broad tail and a frond-like shape.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax, implemented by former Mayor Ed Murray, was touted as a way to reduce sugar consumption and raise revenue for public health initiatives. However, the tax has been a disaster, with many residents voting with their wallets and buying sugary drinks outside the city limits.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed after just two months due to public outcry. The tax added a penny per ounce to sugary drinks and artificially sweetened beverages, but was later repealed after retailers and restaurants reported significant losses in sales. The tax was also criticized for being regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families.\n\nIn Seattle, the tax has led to a 64% increase in the price of a case of Gatorade, from $15.99 to $26.33. Retailers like Costco have taken to posting signs directing customers to nearby locations outside the city limits where they can buy the same products without the tax. The tax has also been criticized for being inconsistent, exempting sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as Starbucks drinks.\n\nThe tax has been a failure in achieving its intended goal of reducing sugar consumption. Instead, it has led to people buying their sugary drinks outside the city, depriving the city of revenue. The tax has also been criticized for being regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families.\n\nIn Spokane, Washington, a similar tax is being re-introduced, and residents are worried about the impact on local businesses. The tax would add 1.75 cents per ounce to sugary drinks, including syrups and powders used to make soda. Local businesses are concerned that the tax will lead to a decline in sales and hurt their bottom line.\n\nHowever, some residents in Seattle believe the tax is a good way to discourage sugary drink consumption and reduce health problems. The city is expected to make $15 million from the tax, which will be used to fund healthy meals for low-income families.\n\nIn summary, the Seattle soda tax has been a failure in achieving its intended goal of reducing sugar consumption and has led to a decline in revenue for the city.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark, found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen were more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder (HKD), a rare condition that affects children's behavior.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Beate Ritz, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, emphasized that the findings do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 after Mike Brown, a Caltech astronomer, discovered the dwarf planet Eris, which was found to be larger than Pluto. Brown's discovery led to the redefinition of the term \"planet\" by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

Simpson, now 70, appeared before a parole board in Nevada and expressed remorse for his actions, stating that he had \"done my time\" and had been a model prisoner. He also claimed that he had been misled by his associates and had taken part in the robbery to reclaim family heirlooms.\n\nSimpson's parole hearing was a significant event, drawing comparisons to his infamous 1995 trial for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. The trial, which captivated the nation, was marked by racial tensions, police corruption, and celebrity culture. Simpson's acquittal sparked widespread outrage and a civil judgment against him for the wrongful death of Goldman.\n\nSimpson's parole was granted unanimously by the Nevada parole board, citing his stable release plans, lack of prior convictions, and stable community ties. However, Simpson's remorse for the 2007 robbery was questioned by his former associate, Tom Ricci, who claimed Simpson orchestrated the heist and took part in a \"lethal\" robbery.\n\nSimpson's family members, including his daughter Arnelle, testified in his favor, describing him as a \"model prisoner\" and a \"peacemaker.\" Simpson also expressed remorse for his actions, stating that he had \"done my time\" and was ready to move forward.\n\nThe Internet Archive, a non-profit organization, has been working to preserve web pages and links to prevent broken links and lost information.

{"pred": "**Colorectal Cancer Rates Rising in Younger People: A Wake-Up Call for the Medical Community**\n\nA recent study has revealed a concerning trend: one in seven colon and rectal cancers are now diagnosed in people under the age of 50, a significant increase from previous years. Researchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 (15%) of them were under 50. This trend is a \"wake-up call\" to the medical community, according to Dr. Samantha Hendren, a lead researcher on the study.\n\n**Current Guidelines and Findings**\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend that people start screening for colorectal cancer at age 50. However, the study's findings suggest that this age may be too late for some people. Younger patients (under 50) were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer, but they also lived longer without a recurrence of cancer after treatment. In fact, 95% of patients under 50 with localized cancer survived for five years, compared to 92% of patients over 50. For patients with advanced cancer, the five-year survival rate was 21% for those under 50, compared to 14% for those over 50.\n\n**Younger Patients' Treatment Patterns**\n\nYounger patients under 50 were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) than older patients. This may be due to the fact that younger patients tend to have more advanced cancer, which requires more aggressive treatment.\n\n**Risk Factors and Prevention**\n\nWhile the study's findings are alarming, the exact reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger people are unclear. Researchers note that factors such as smoking, obesity, and poor diet may contribute to the trend. Dr. David Weinberg notes that \"it is unexplained\" and that \"there may be an effect of our environment that is contributing to the increase.\"\n\n**Recommendations for Early Screening**\n\nThe study's lead researcher, Dr. Samantha Hendren, suggests that doctors should be more vigilant in screening for colorectal cancer in younger patients, especially those with a family history of the disease. Dr. David Weinberg notes that \"we should think more about the potential of them having colon cancer at an earlier age.\" Dr. Hendren also notes that \"we need to optimize the screening of bowel symptoms in young people, especially those with a family history of colorectal cancer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The scale categorizes civilizations based on their energy consumption, with Type I being a planet-based civilization, Type II harnessing the energy of a star, and Type III harnessing the energy of a galaxy. Hooper's paper suggests that a civilization must expand its energy sources to other galaxies to survive, as the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to dark energy. This expansion will eventually make it impossible for a civilization to access energy from stars beyond a certain distance.\n\nTo achieve this, Hooper proposes that a civilization would need to capture and harness the energy of stars, using a swarm of satellites, known as a Dyson swarm, to collect and beam energy back to the home planet. This process would require a significant amount of energy and would likely be detectable by astronomers.\n\n**The Search for Alien Life**\n\nAstrophysicist Dan Hooper suggests that a civilization would need to capture and harness the energy of stars to survive.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

A team of researchers, led by paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, has found evidence of the Middle Stone Age, a period characterized by the use of smaller, more specialized stone tools, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This discovery challenges the long-held view that the Middle Stone Age began around 200,000 years ago.\n\nThe team's findings, published in three papers in the journal Science, suggest that early humans in the Olorgesailie Basin were able to adapt to changing environments by developing new technologies and social networks. The researchers found evidence of long-distance trade of raw materials, including obsidian, which was transported from 25-50 kilometers away. The tools were made with greater care and precision, indicating a higher level of cognitive ability.\n\nThe discovery of the Middle Stone Age tools in the Olorgesailie Basin also suggests that early humans were able to develop complex social networks and exchange goods, including pigments and tools, over long distances. This is similar to the behavior of modern humans today, who often form relationships with other groups to ensure survival during times of hardship.\n\nThe findings suggest that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments by developing new technologies and social networks.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

However, many have disputed this claim, labeling it as \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" and \"stupidity.\"\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has sparked debate over the loss of a widely used and successful audio standard. Critics argue that the Lightning cable, which replaces the standard jack, is not as effective in transmitting audio information, resulting in a lower sound quality. Apple's AirPods, a wireless alternative, have also been criticized for their lack of durability and high price point of $159.\n\nThe decision has also sparked concerns about the convenience of using the iPhone 7. Users are now unable to charge their phone and listen to music simultaneously without using a $9 auxiliary cable or wireless technology. The removal of the headphone jack has also affected other devices that rely on the standard jack, such as Square's credit card dongle, thermal imaging cameras, and other devices.\n\nCritics argue that Apple's decision is driven by a desire to sell more expensive and proprietary products, such as the AirPods, and to build a walled garden ecosystem. The old Apple mantra of \"it just works\" has been replaced by a more restrictive approach, forcing users to pay for the privilege of using their devices.\n\nThe decision has sparked widespread criticism on social media, with many users expressing frustration and disappointment.

Kieran was born with a rare condition called bilateral microtia, where he had no fully formed ears and was also deaf. However, thanks to several previous operations and a hearing aid, Kieran has been able to hear and communicate with his family.\n\nThe surgical team, led by Neil Bulstrode, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon at Great Ormond Street Hospital, used cartilage from Kieran's ribs to create the framework for his new ears. The procedure, which took six hours to complete, involved shaping the cartilage into the shape of Kieran's mother's ears, which served as a template.\n\nThe surgery was primarily cosmetic, aiming to improve Kieran's appearance and boost his confidence. Kieran's parents, David and Louise Sorkin, were overjoyed with the result, saying it would help their son feel more accepted by his peers. Kieran himself expressed his excitement, stating that he wanted to look like his friends and wear sunglasses and earphones without drawing attention to his ears.\n\nThe surgical team at Great Ormond Street Hospital performs about 40 such operations each year, mostly to create one ear at a time. However, in Kieran's case, they were able to create both ears simultaneously, achieving a balanced and natural look.\n\nThe procedure is a significant step forward in the field of reconstructive surgery, and researchers are working on developing new techniques to create new ears using stem cells. Scientists at the Institute of Child Health are experimenting with growing new cartilage from a child's own stem cells, which could potentially be a less invasive and more efficient method.\n\nKieran will need a follow-up surgery in six months to refine the shape of his ears, but his parents are optimistic that the results will be long-lasting. The family is grateful for the new development in Kieran's life, which has brought him immense confidence and happiness.\n\n**Psychological Benefits of the Surgery**\n\nThe surgery has brought huge psychological benefits to Kieran, who was previously self-conscious about his appearance.

The company's troubles began when federal marshals raided its Nashville and Memphis facilities, seizing wood and shutting down production. This is not the first time Gibson has faced scrutiny; a similar raid occurred in 2009, when the company was accused of importing ebony from Madagascar, a country with a ban on exporting the wood.\n\nThe Lacey Act, amended in 2008 to include plants, requires companies to ensure that the wood they use is sourced responsibly. However, Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims that the company has been unfairly targeted and that the law is too burdensome. The company maintains that it has complied with all relevant laws, but the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has concluded that Gibson knowingly sourced wood from endangered species, including rosewood and ebony.\n\nThe EIA's director, Andrea Johnson, says that Gibson's actions demonstrate a lack of responsibility in sourcing wood, despite the company's claims of compliance. Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, disputes these allegations, stating that the company has always followed the law and that the recent raids are an overreach of the Lacey Act.\n\nThe guitar industry is also affected by the Lacey Act, with some companies worried about the law's retroactive nature. The law requires companies to prove the origin of wood used in their instruments, even if they were built decades ago. This has led to concerns about the impact on the industry, with some companies, like Gibson, facing potential prosecution.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also led to changes in the way companies source wood, with some, like the C.F. Martin Guitar Company, choosing to avoid using rosewood and other endangered species. The law has also led to a shift in the way companies operate, with some, like George Gruhn, a Nashville guitar dealer, saying that the law has forced him to reevaluate his business practices.\n\nThe Lacey Act has been amended to cover the trade in vintage instruments, and the government has filed a motion in court, stating that Gibson's use of rosewood and ebony from Madagascar is a violation of the law. The case highlights the complexities of the Lacey Act and its impact on the music industry.\n\n**Key Points", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

By using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer algorithms, they were able to reconstruct YouTube videos from brain activity patterns recorded while subjects watched the videos. This achievement marks a significant step towards decoding the brain's internal workings, including dreams, memories, and even fantasies.\n\nThe study involved researchers from the team lying inside an MRI machine while watching YouTube videos. The brain activity was recorded and used to build a model that matched visual patterns with brain activity. This model was then used to reconstruct the videos from brain activity alone, creating a continuous, dynamic representation of the visual experience.\n\nThe reconstructed videos are a continuous, dream-like interpretation of reality, with the brain activity patterns matched to the visual information. The results are abstract and blurry, but they demonstrate the potential for decoding brain activity into visual experiences. This technology has the potential to unlock the secrets of the brain's visual processing, including understanding how the brain processes visual information, reconstructing internal imagery, and even decoding dreams and memories.\n\nThe researchers believe that this technology could be used to broadcast imagery from the brain, such as dreams, memories, and even intentions. However, the accuracy of the reconstructed videos is limited by the complexity of brain activity and the resolution of the computer models used to analyze it. The team is working to improve the resolution and accuracy of the models by analyzing more brain areas and developing more complex algorithms.\n\nThe potential applications of this technology are vast, including the possibility of using it to help people with paralyzing conditions communicate through brain activity.

It's a method called \"spearphishing,\" according to the New York Times. \"It was very convincing,\" Mike Murray of the cybersecurity firm Lookout tells CNN, adding that it would be tough to tell the real page from the fake one, even if they were side-by-side. The fake login page was ultimately removed by the cloud hosting company DigitalOcean. The company's chief security officer says the threat was identified before the attack was launched. \"We see no evidence that any sensitive data was stolen,\" he says. A DNC official tells the Times that it is not clear who the hackers were in this case. But, the paper recalls, a 2016 hack of the DNC was ultimately traced to Russia. This latest attempt, DNC Chief Security Officer Bob Lord tells the Times, \"is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks.\" Earlier this week, Microsoft reported that it had uncovered new Russian hacking attempts targeting conservative organizations in the US."], "all_classes": null, "length": 716}

The study, which covered 188 countries from 1980 to 2013, found that obesity rates are rising in both developed and developing countries, with no country showing a decline in obesity rates over the past 30 years.\n\nThe United States leads the world in obesity rates, with 13% of its population being obese, despite having only 5% of the world's population. However, other countries, such as those in the Middle East and North Africa, have even higher rates of obesity, with over 50% of men in some countries and over 65% of women in others being obese.\n\nThe study found that obesity rates are increasing in both developed and developing countries, with the biggest rises seen in developing nations. The researchers attributed the rise in obesity to the increased availability of cheap, high-calorie foods and decreased physical activity. The study also found that obesity is a major risk factor for various health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.\n\nThe study's findings are alarming, with nearly 3.4 million people dying annually due to complications related to obesity. The researchers emphasized that obesity is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach to address the root causes, including changes in diet and lifestyle.\n\nThe study highlights the need for a global response to the growing obesity crisis, with the World Health Organization launching a commission to study the issue and develop solutions. The study's findings also underscore the importance of addressing the issue of obesity in developing countries, where the problem is most acute.\n\nSome key statistics from the study include:\n\n* 2.1 billion people worldwide are overweight or obese, exceeding 30% of the global population.\n* The number of overweight or obese people has increased by 28% in adults and 50% in children over the past 30 years.\n* The Middle East and North Africa have the highest rates of obesity, with over 50% of adults in these regions being obese.\n* The United States has the largest number of obese people, with 13% of its population being obese.\n* Obesity is a major risk factor for various health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.\n* The study found that obesity is a complex issue, requiring a comprehensive", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

The elections, which began in November, have seen the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, the party founded by the Brotherhood, emerge as a dominant force, with the possibility of winning a majority of seats in the new parliament. The Brotherhood has played down its chances of winning a majority, but analysts believe it could be a significant development if it happens.\n\nThe Brotherhood's lead in the polls has been attributed to its well-organized campaign and the popularity of its candidates, particularly in the provinces of Gharbiya and Daqahliyya. The party has said it will form a coalition government with other parties, including liberals and secularists, to ensure a smooth transition of power.\n\nMeanwhile, the trial of Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted in February, has resumed after a two-month hiatus. The chief prosecutor, Mustafa Suleiman, accused Mubarak of imposing a \"tyrannical rule\" and seeking to pass on his power to his son, Gamal, who was a key figure in the ruling party. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters, and faces the death penalty if convicted.\n\nThe trial has been bogged down by procedural issues, including a request by the defense to remove the presiding judge. Mubarak has been held in a hospital for health reasons, and his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, are also on trial for corruption charges.\n\nThe trial is seen as a test of the military's willingness to hold the former leader accountable for his actions.

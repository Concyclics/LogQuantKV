In Philadelphia, the Occupy Philly protesters, who had set up camp on Dilworth Plaza, were given a deadline by Mayor Nutter to vacate the area by 5 p.m. on Sunday, November 27. However, the protesters chose to stay, and by 7:15 p.m., roughly 100 protesters were still on the plaza, chanting slogans and holding signs. The protesters, who were mostly cooperative and non-violent, were calm and peaceful, with some even thanking the police for their restraint.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the LAPD declared an unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to disperse from the streets surrounding City Hall by midnight on Sunday. However, the protesters refused to leave, and the police eventually gave them permission to stay until at least dawn on Monday. The standoff ended with no major incidents, but four people were arrested for being part of an unlawful assembly. The protesters, who had grown to over 2,000, were mostly peaceful, with some minor skirmishes and debris scattered on the streets.\n\nIn contrast, the Occupy LA encampment in Los Angeles had a much larger turnout, with over 2,000 people gathered outside City Hall. The protesters, who had been given a deadline to vacate the area, had swelled to 2,000 by Sunday night, with many supporters from labor unions, clergy, and other groups joining the cause.\n\nThe Los Angeles police, unlike other cities, showed restraint and allowed the protesters to stay in the park. The police had initially closed the streets surrounding City Hall, but the protesters were able to stay in the park. The police eventually allowed the protesters to stay until at least dawn on Monday.\n\nThe police in Philadelphia, however, had a different approach. The city had given the Occupy Philly protesters a 5 p.m. deadline to vacate the area, but the protesters chose to stay. The police had initially given a 4 a.m. deadline for the protesters to leave, but the protesters remained, and the police eventually allowed them to stay.\n\nThe protesters in all three cities were protesting corporate greed and economic inequality, and the movement has gained momentum.

The letter, published in Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, reveals Kalashnikov's spiritual pain and moral responsibility for the deaths caused by his rifle.\n\nKalashnikov, who died at the age of 94, wrote the letter in May 2012, shortly before his death. In the letter, he expressed his \"spiritual pain\" and asked if he was responsible for the deaths caused by his invention. He also questioned why God allowed him to create a \"killing machine\" that was used by people to harm others.\n\nThe letter, written on Kalashnikov's personal paper, is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God.\" The letter is a significant departure from Kalashnikov's previous stance on his invention, as he had previously refused to accept responsibility for the deaths caused by his rifle.\n\nKalashnikov's daughter, Elena, believes that her father may have written the letter with the help of a priest, as she stated that her father may have \"composed\" the letter with the assistance of a priest. Kalashnikov's spiritual crisis is a significant change from his previous stance on his invention, which he saw as a tool to defend his country, not a killing machine.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has responded to Kalashnikov's letter, stating that the Church has a definite position on the use of the rifle. The Church's press secretary, Cyril Alexander Volkov, said that the Church supports the use of the rifle when it serves to defend the country, but not when it is used by terrorists.\n\nKalashnikov's invention, the AK-47, has been widely used in conflicts around the world, including in the hands of child soldiers. The rifle has become a symbol of the Soviet era and a testament to Kalashnikov's ingenuity. Despite his spiritual crisis, Kalashnikov's invention remains a significant part of Russian history and a testament to his legacy.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has a close relationship with the Russian state, and Kalashnikov's letter is seen as a way to consolidate the Church's position.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

This resistance is not limited to the bacteria's ability to withstand antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, but also allows them to adhere more effectively to human cells, making it easier for them to cause infections.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was four times more resistant to the immune system's killing mechanisms than non-exposed MRSA. This increased resistance was observed in both human cells and mice, with the smoke-exposed bacteria causing more severe infections and higher mortality rates.\n\nThe study also compared the effects of cigarette smoke to e-cigarette vapor, finding that cigarette smoke was significantly more effective at making MRSA more resistant to the immune system. The study suggests that cigarette smoke can alter the cell walls of MRSA, making them more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This increased resistance can lead to more severe infections and higher mortality rates.\n\nIn addition, the study found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, making it more difficult to kill. The study also found that the smoke-exposed bacteria were more likely to adhere to human cells, making it easier for them to cause infections.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, particularly for smokers who are more susceptible to infectious diseases.

Two recent examples highlight the issue: Samsung's new smart TV and Microsoft's Xbox One.\n\n**Samsung's Smart TV Policy**\n\nSamsung's new smart TV policy has sparked controversy due to its ability to listen in on users' conversations, even when the TV is turned off. The policy allows the company to collect voice data, including voice commands, and transmit it to third-party services. This has drawn comparisons to George Orwell's 1984, where the government monitored citizens' conversations. Samsung claims that the data is encrypted and that users can opt out of voice recognition features, but critics argue that the policy is a threat to user privacy.\n\n**Xbox One's Always-On Listening Mode**\n\nMicrosoft's Xbox One gaming console has also raised concerns about user data collection. The new Kinect, a motion-sensing peripheral, is always listening for voice cues, even when the console is turned off. This allows users to control the Xbox with voice commands, but it also raises concerns about constant surveillance. The new Kinect can recognize and process audio, including recognizing individual voices and even detecting the heartbeat of users. Microsoft claims that the system is designed to provide a low-power listening mode, but critics argue that this raises concerns about user privacy.\n\n**Similarities and Concerns**\n\nBoth Samsung and Microsoft's smart devices are designed to collect user data, including voice commands and video viewing habits. The devices are designed to provide personalized recommendations and improve user experience, but critics argue that this comes at the cost of user privacy. The comparison to 1984 is not unfounded, as both devices are designed to collect and transmit user data to third-party services.\n\n**Comparison to Google Glass**\n\nWhile Google Glass is not always listening, it does require users to be aware of its presence. In contrast, the Xbox's always-on listening mode may not be as noticeable, raising concerns about user surveillance. The Xbox's always-on listening mode is a departure from the previous Kinect, which was only enabled in specific situations.\n\n**Company Statements**\n\nBoth Samsung and Microsoft have addressed concerns about user privacy. Samsung claims that data is encrypted and that users can opt out of voice recognition features. Microsoft has also stated that it has a long history of prioritizing user privacy and has implemented safeguards to protect user data.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe rise of smart TVs and gaming consoles has raised concerns about user privacy.

The practice of institutionalizing children is a global issue that has been met with a lack of outrage and awareness. However, thanks to the efforts of Lumos, a charity founded by JK Rowling, there is hope for change.\n\nLumos was established in 2002 after JK Rowling was inspired to take action after seeing a disturbing image of a child locked in a caged bed in a newspaper. The organization's mission is to bring light to the lives of millions of children who are being held in institutions worldwide. The statistics are staggering: 8 million children are locked away, with many suffering from malnutrition, poverty, and abuse.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization are long-lasting and irreparable, causing stunting, developmental delays, and psychological trauma. Children are often taken away from their families due to poverty, lack of education, and healthcare, and are often placed in institutions as a last resort. However, research has shown that this is not the only solution.\n\nLumos has made significant progress in reducing the number of children in institutions in countries such as Moldova, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70% since 2007. In the Czech Republic, the number of children in institutions has decreased by 16% in the past year, and in Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has decreased by 54%.\n\nLumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated by 2050, but it requires a global commitment to change.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones?

Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to the price of sugary drinks, was implemented in Seattle in 2018 and has been met with widespread criticism. \n\nThe tax has been shown to be regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families who are forced to pay more for their sugary drinks. Many have taken to voting with their wallets, buying their drinks outside the city limits, where prices are lower. This has led to a decline in revenue for the city, as well as a loss of business for local retailers.\n\nSimilar to the situation in Seattle, Cook County, Illinois, implemented a sweetened beverage tax in 2018, which was met with a public outcry. The tax added a penny per ounce to the price of sugary drinks and artificially sweetened beverages. However, the tax was eventually repealed after a public backlash, with many retailers and restaurants seeing a decline in sales due to the tax.\n\nIn Spokane, Washington, a bill is being re-introduced to bring a sugary drink tax to the state. The tax would add nearly two cents to every ounce of sugary drink, with the revenue generated going towards funding healthy food options for low-income families. However, the tax has been met with resistance from residents, who are heading to nearby cities to buy their drinks.\n\nThe tax has been shown to be regressive, with many retailers and restaurants losing business due to the tax.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The study analyzed data from over 64,000 children in the Danish National Birth Cohort study and found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen were more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD and other related disorders.\n\nAccording to the study, pregnant women who took acetaminophen were 29% more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD and 37% more likely to have children diagnosed with a rare disorder called hyperkinetic disorder.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The discovery of a new planet, dubbed \"Planet Nine,\" has been making headlines in the scientific community. The planet, which is believed to be almost as big as Neptune, is thought to be lurking in the outer reaches of our solar system, far beyond the orbit of Pluto.\n\nThe discovery was made by Mike Brown, a Caltech astronomer who is known for his role in Pluto's demotion from the status of a planet. Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, have been searching for evidence of the hidden planet, which they believe is almost as massive as Neptune. They have used mathematical models and computer simulations to predict the planet's existence and orbit.\n\nThe researchers believe that the planet is almost as big as Neptune and orbits the sun at a distance of about 20 times that of Neptune. They estimate that it would take about 5-10 years for the planet to complete one orbit around the sun. The researchers have also suggested that the planet could be an icy, rocky world with a mass of 5-10 times that of Earth.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about Pluto's status as a planet. Pluto was once considered a planet, but it was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) voted to define a planet as an object that has cleared its neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto did not meet this criterion, and it was reclassified as a dwarf planet. The debate over Pluto's status has been ongoing, with some scientists arguing that it should be reinstated as a planet. However, Mike Brown, the astronomer who discovered Pluto, believes that the controversy is unnecessary and that the focus should be on the fact that Pluto is an interesting and unique object in the Kuiper Belt.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked debate about the definition of a planet. The researchers believe that the planet is an icy, rocky world with a mass of 5-10 times that of Earth.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The bulletin, which was titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE,\" warned of a powerful hurricane with unprecedented strength, predicting that \"most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks, at least one half of well-constructed homes will have roof and wall failure, and that water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\"\n\nRicks, who was responsible for the Slidell, Louisiana, office, which has jurisdiction over New Orleans, knew he had to convey the urgency and severity of the situation to the public.

According to the study, nearly 15% of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer are under 50, which is a significant increase from previous estimates. This trend raises questions about the current guidelines for screening and treatment of colorectal cancer.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that younger patients (under 50) were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer, including tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. However, despite having more aggressive cancer, younger patients tended to live longer without a recurrence of cancer after treatment.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, notes that the reasons for this trend are unclear, but it may be related to environmental factors, such as a poor diet, smoking, and physical inactivity. Dr. Hendren emphasizes the importance of doctors being aware of the increasing number of colorectal cancer cases in young people and to look for warning signs, such as bleeding, changes in bowel movements, and bleeding.\n\n**Warning Signs of Colorectal Cancer:**\n\n*   **Bleeding from the rectum or colon\n*   **Changes in bowel movements\n*   **Bleeding from the rectum or colon\n\n**Current Guidelines:**\n\n*   The American Cancer Society recommends screening for colorectal cancer starting at age 50.\n*   However, some experts suggest that screening should start earlier, especially for those with a family history of colorectal cancer.\n\n**Treatment Outcomes:**\n\n*   Younger patients (under 50) tend to live longer without a cancer recurrence after treatment.\n*   They are more likely to undergo surgery and radiation therapy.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n*   Doctors should be aware of the increasing number of colorectal cancer cases in young people and look for warning signs.\n*   Patients with a family history of colorectal cancer should start screening earlier.\n*   The medical community needs to prepare for the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe study's findings raise concerns about the current guidelines for screening and treating colorectal cancer.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, is located in the Flinders Ranges, 550 km north of Adelaide. The site was discovered by Giles Hamm, a consultant archaeologist, and Clifford Coulthard, a local elder, while surveying the area. The site contains 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, including the remains of the extinct giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum, which suggests that humans interacted with the megafauna in the region.\n\nThe site's age was determined through optical and radiocarbon dating, which showed that humans occupied the area between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago. The findings also suggest that Aboriginal Australians were able to develop key technologies such as bone and stone tools, ochre, and hafts, which were previously thought to have been developed in other parts of the world. The discovery also pushes back the development of these technologies by 10,000 years, with the earliest evidence of human interaction with the megafauna, including the use of ochre and the development of stone and bone tools.\n\nThe discovery has rewritten the story of Indigenous Australians, showing that they were able to develop and use complex technologies, such as hafts, and interact with megafauna, including the Diprotodon, which was a giant wombat-like creature.

The board, consisting of six members, including Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, James Murdoch, and James Rice, has stated that they have been discussing the possibility of taking the company private with Elon Musk. The discussions, which took place last week, focused on how being a private company could better serve Tesla's long-term interests and addressed the funding required for the deal.\n\nThe proposed deal, which would value the company at over $70 billion, would be the largest buyout in history. Elon Musk, who owns 20% of the company, has stated that he has secured the necessary funding for the deal, but the board's statement leaves many questions unanswered.

The three stages of the Kardashev scale are:\n\n1.  **Type I**: Harnessing all the resources of a planet, which is the current level of human civilization.\n2.  **Type II**: Harnessing the energy of a star, which is a step that scientists believe humans may reach in a few thousand years.\n3.  **Type III**: Harnessing the energy of a galaxy, which is a stage that may be achievable by a civilization that has overcome the challenges of universal expansion.\n\nAccording to Hooper, a civilization that wants to harness the energy of stars beyond its own galaxy must first understand the effects of universal expansion. The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, causing stars to move beyond the cosmic horizon, making them inaccessible. A civilization that wants to harness the energy of stars must first reel them in, creating a \"solar-powered\" energy source.\n\nTo achieve this, a civilization would need to create a swarm of satellites, known as a Dyson swarm, which would be made up of millions of individual satellites that would collect and beam energy from the star. This would be detectable through the radiation and light emitted by the star, which would be different from the normal light emitted by the star. This would be a sign of a civilization that has reached the Type II stage of the Kardashev scale.\n\nHowever, the universe is expanding, and stars beyond our galaxy will be inaccessible in a few billion years.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Santorum, who lost to Romney in the poll, claimed that Romney's campaign paid for tickets to the event, which led to a disproportionate number of votes for the former Massachusetts governor. However, Romney's campaign denied the allegations, stating that Santorum's claim was unfounded and that Romney's campaign did not pay for tickets. Santorum shot back, saying that his campaign did not engage in such tactics, but rather relied on grassroots support.\n\n**Romney's Conservative Credentials**\n\nMitt Romney's claim to be a \"severe conservative\" has been met with skepticism by other Republican presidential contenders, including Ron Paul.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR.

However, critics argue that this move is a step backwards in audio technology.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has been met with ridicule on Twitter, with many users calling it \"arrogant\" and \"stupid.\" Critics argue that the decision is driven by Apple's desire to sell more expensive and proprietary accessories, such as the $159 AirPods. The AirPods, which use wireless technology, have been criticized for their poor sound quality and ease of loss.\n\nPhil Schiller's justification for the removal of the headphone jack has been widely mocked, with many pointing out that it's not a courageous move, but rather a decision driven by Apple's desire for profit. Critics argue that the decision is a non-technological excuse, as music sounds better over a wire than over wireless technology.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has also led to the loss of other devices that used to plug into the iPhone's headphone jack, including Square's credit card dongle, temperature sensors, and other devices. Apple's decision has been likened to San Francisco's treatment of the middle class, with critics arguing that the decision is driven by a desire to sell more expensive accessories.\n\nThe decision has also led to a change in the way users can charge their phones and listen to music. Users can no longer charge their phone and listen to music at the same time without using a wireless connection, which is not as good as a wired connection.\n\nApple's decision has been met with widespread criticism, with many users expressing their frustration on Twitter. Critics argue that the decision is a step back in technology and a move driven by profit, rather than innovation.\n\nThe old Apple mantra of \"it just works\" is now dead, replaced by a more expensive and proprietary system.

The new system, which is being rolled out to all United gates nationwide, simplifies the boarding process by reducing the number of boarding lanes from five to two. The new process is designed to reduce wait times, minimize congestion, and make boarding more efficient.\n\n**Key Changes to the Boarding Process:**\n\n- The new boarding process features two lanes, numbered 1 and 2, with lane 1 designated for Premier 1K and elite passengers, as well as those with United credit cards.\n- Group 1 and 2 will board in Lane 1, while Group 3, 4, and 5 will board in Lane 2.\n- The new process will allow passengers to board in a more staggered manner, reducing congestion and minimizing wait times.\n- The airline will also send push notifications to passengers on their mobile devices when boarding begins, allowing them to stay informed and avoid unnecessary waiting.\n\n**Background and Rationale:**\n\nUnited's managing director of global operations strategy, Maria Walter, stated that the previous five-lane system created \"clusters of travelers\" and \"clusters of angst\" among passengers.

The procedure, carried out at Great Ormond Street Hospital, involved creating two new ears from cartilage taken from Kieran's ribs. The surgical team, led by Neil Bulstrode, a consultant plastic surgeon, used a combination of previous operations and a hearing aid to help Kieran hear. \n\nKieran, from Hertfordshire, was born with a rare condition called bilateral microtia, where he had small lobes instead of ears. He was also deaf, but thanks to several previous operations and a hearing aid, he can now hear. However, he still had a significant cosmetic issue, which the surgery aimed to address.\n\nThe procedure, which took six hours to complete, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into the framework of his new ears. The skin was then taken from his skin and used to cover the cartilage, allowing the ears to take shape. The surgical team used a template of Kieran's mother's ears to create a natural look.\n\nThe surgery is primarily cosmetic, aiming to boost Kieran's confidence and self-esteem. The procedure is not aimed at improving hearing but rather to give Kieran a more natural appearance. The surgical team hopes that the new ears will be a huge confidence booster for Kieran, allowing him to fit in with his peers and wear sunglasses and earphones like other children.\n\nKieran's family is overjoyed with the result, and his parents are thrilled that their son is finally able to wear sunglasses and earphones. The procedure is a significant step forward in Kieran's life, and he is expected to have a follow-up operation in six months to refine the shape of his ears.\n\nThe procedure is a significant milestone for Great Ormond Street Hospital, which performs about 40 such operations every year. The hospital is also working on a new technique using stem cells to create new ears, which could be less invasive than the current method.\n\nKieran's surgery is a significant step forward in his life, and he is expected to have a huge boost in confidence. The procedure is a significant step forward in the field of reconstructive surgery, and it has the potential to change the lives of many children with similar conditions.\n\nThe procedure has also sparked a new area of research, with scientists working on creating new ears from stem cells.

Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

Scientists have discovered that an ancient ocean, at least 137 meters deep, covered nearly half of the Martian surface, with the water being enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. This ancient ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was a significant portion of the Martian water, with the water covering nearly half of the planet's surface. The ocean was formed when the Martian atmosphere was much thicker, allowing for a deeper and more stable water body.\n\nThe studies, conducted by NASA scientists, used the most powerful infra-red telescopes to analyze the Martian atmosphere and water composition. The team found that the Martian water was enriched with deuterium, which led to the conclusion that the planet lost a significant amount of water over time.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

This type of sound is thought to be a result of the bird's body size and the inflation of the esophageal pouch, which is a common trait among birds and non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nResearchers used a statistical approach to analyze the vocalizations of birds and other reptiles, including crocodiles and birds, and found that closed-mouth vocalizations are a common trait among birds and non-avian dinosaurs. The study suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved independently in different species, including birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles, and that this behavior is associated with large body sizes and is used primarily for mating and territorial displays.\n\nThe study found that closed-mouth vocalizations are rare in small bird species, but are common in large bird species, such as ostriches and cassowaries. The study suggests that dinosaurs may have had a similar capacity for closed-mouth vocalizations, which are low-frequency sounds that are used primarily for mating and territorial displays. The study found that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization has evolved independently in different species, including birds, crocodiles, and dinosaurs.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to those of birds, such as low, low-pitched coos or mumbles, rather than the loud, blood-curdling roars often depicted in movies. The study's results also suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization is not unique to birds and dinosaurs, but is also found in other reptiles, including crocodiles and birds.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur sounds, which are still a mystery. The study suggests that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to those of birds, such as low, low-pitched coos or mumbles, rather than the loud, blood-curdling roars often depicted in movies.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The letter, dated May 2012, was published by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, and reveals a side of Kalashnikov that was previously unknown to the public.\n\nKalashnikov's letter, typed on his personal writing paper, is a poignant expression of his inner turmoil. He questioned whether he was responsible for the deaths caused by his rifle, which has been used by terrorists, child soldiers, and other groups around the world. The letter is a stark contrast to his previous stance, where he refused to accept responsibility for the lives lost due to his invention.\n\nThe AK-47, designed by Kalashnikov in the 1940s, has become one of the most recognizable and widely used weapons in the world. Over 100 million rifles have been sold worldwide, making it a symbol of both military power and violence. Kalashnikov's design was initially intended to defend his country, but its simplicity and durability made it easy to manufacture and use, leading to its widespread proliferation.\n\nKalashnikov's conversion to Christianity, which occurred at the age of 91, is also a significant aspect of his life. He was baptized and began attending church services, which may have contributed to his spiritual awakening.

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. This increased resistance allows the bacteria to repel common forms of immune responses, making it more difficult to treat. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be inherited.\n\nIn lab studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be more aggressive and better at invading human cells. In fact, the smoke-exposed MRSA was able to kill more mice than non-exposed MRSA. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, stated that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances its survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke functions like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. This is a concerning finding, as cigarette smokers are already known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. The study's results add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.\n\nIn a related study, researchers found that e-cigarette vapor also makes MRSA more resistant, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, as they suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also makes pathogens more aggressive. The study's results highlight the need for continued research into the effects of cigarette smoke on human health and the development of new strategies to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

{"pred": "A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Toulouse, led by Young-Ho Eom, has shed light on the concept of influence and importance in the digital age. The study analyzed Wikipedia pages across 24 major language editions to determine which individuals are considered the most important and influential in the world.\n\nInitially, the study used Google's PageRank algorithm to rank individuals based on the number of links pointing to their Wikipedia pages. However, this method produced unexpected results, with Carl Linnaeus, an 18th-century Swedish naturalist, emerging as the most important person in the world. This was largely due to the fact that Linnaeus' work on taxonomy has led to the naming of countless species, resulting in a large number of links pointing to his Wikipedia page.\n\nTo address this issue, the researchers developed a new method called 2DRank, which combines PageRank and CheiRank (a measure of outgoing links) to determine an individual's influence. Using this method, the study found that Frank Sinatra, the famous American singer, was the most important person in the world, followed by Michael Jackson and Madonna.\n\nHowever, a subsequent study by the same researcher, Eom, using a different approach, found that Carl Linnaeus was actually the most influential thinker in the world. This study analyzed the web of links between Wikipedia pages to determine whose intellectual influence stretched the furthest. According to Eom, Linnaeus' work on taxonomy has led to a vast network of links, making him the most influential person in the world.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate about the nature of influence and importance in the digital age.

Samsung and Microsoft, two major players in the tech industry, have been at the center of these concerns.\n\n**Samsung's Smart TVs**\n\nSamsung's new smart TV policy has sparked controversy over its ability to listen in on users' conversations, even when the TV is turned off. The policy allows the company and its partners to collect and transmit voice data to third-party services, raising concerns about data privacy and the potential for mass surveillance. The policy has drawn comparisons to George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984, where the government has complete control over citizens' lives. Samsung's policy states that users can opt out of voice recognition, but this will disable the feature entirely, and the company will still collect data on how users interact with the TV.\n\n**Microsoft's Xbox One**\n\nMicrosoft's new Xbox One console has also raised concerns over its always-on listening mode. The console comes equipped with a Kinect sensor that can read users' voice commands, even when the console is turned off. This feature allows users to turn on the console by simply saying \"Xbox On,\" but it also raises concerns about data privacy and the potential for mass surveillance. Microsoft claims that the Kinect is only listening for specific cues, such as the \"Xbox On\" command, and that the company has a strong commitment to user privacy. However, the always-on listening mode has sparked concerns about the potential for malicious actors to access users' data.\n\n**Common Concerns**\n\nBoth Samsung and Microsoft's policies have raised concerns about data privacy and the potential for mass surveillance. The trend of smart devices in homes has sparked fears about the collection and transmission of user data, and the potential for companies to use this data for targeted advertising or other purposes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning about the condition, which affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause paralysis, respiratory failure, and other serious symptoms.\n\n**What is AFM?**\n\nAFM is a rare condition that can cause sudden and severe muscle weakness, often in children, but can also affect adults. The exact cause of AFM is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections, including enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Symptoms include pain in the arms and legs, difficulty breathing, and facial droop.\n\n**Outbreaks and Cases**\n\nThe CDC reported 50 cases of AFM in 2016, compared to 21 cases in 2015. In 2014, there were 120 cases reported between August and December, mostly in children. The average age of children affected by AFM is 7 years old, and most have had to be placed on respirators. While 85% of children have recovered partially, only three have fully recovered.\n\n**Investigations and Prevention**\n\nThe CDC is investigating the cause of AFM, but no specific treatment has been found. The best prevention is to practice good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick people, and cleaning surfaces with a disinfectant. The CDC also advises staying up-to-date on vaccinations and protecting oneself from mosquitoes, as the West Nile virus is linked to AFM.\n\n**Personal Stories**\n\nSeveral families have shared their experiences with AFM, including the Roberts family, whose 3-year-old son, Carter, was diagnosed with AFM in July 2016. Carter's mother, Robin, described the rapid progression of the illness, which left her son unable to move his arms or legs. Another family, the Carsons, shared their experience with their 4-year-old daughter, Laura, who was diagnosed with AFM in 2014.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to examine the bloodstains on the shroud.\n\nResearchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth, which bears an image of a crucified man. They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The study concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the Shroud of Turin is likely a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the crucifixion. The researchers noted that if it were a death shroud of a bleeding, executed person, hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, the bloodstains should be more consistent. The study's conclusions are based on the analysis of the bloodstain patterns, and do not take into account other factors that may have affected the bloodstains, such as the body being cleaned or prepared for burial.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin has been the subject of much debate and study over the years, with some regarding it as a genuine relic and others as a medieval forgery.

The rebels are divided into two groups: the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which wants independence, and Ansar Dine, which is linked to the North African branch of al-Qaeda and wants to impose Sharia law. The rebels have taken advantage of the situation and have made rapid advances, with residents in Gao and Kidal reporting that Islamist fighters have ransacked bars and banned Western music.\n\n**International Response**\n\nThe international community has condemned the coup, with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) imposing sanctions on Mali, including a border closure and a freeze on the country's bank account.

{"pred": "**Global Efforts to Eradicate Institutionalization of Children**\n\nThe practice of institutionalizing children, where they are taken away from their families and locked in institutions, is a widespread issue affecting 8 million children worldwide. This problem is not only morally reprehensible but also economically unsustainable. According to JK Rowling, founder and president of Lumos, a charity dedicated to closing child institutions and orphanages, the solution to this issue is not just a moral imperative but also makes excellent economic sense.\n\nLumos was founded in 2005 after Rowling came across a disturbing photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. The charity's mission is to shed light on the lives of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. The majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but they are placed in institutions due to a lack of resources, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization on children are severe and long-lasting. They are more likely to experience malnutrition, abuse, and trafficking, and are often left with developmental delays, stunting, and psychological trauma. In some cases, children are even forced to learn not to cry because they receive no attention or affection.\n\nHowever, there is hope for change. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 with the right investment and support. The charity has already achieved significant success in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70%, 16%, and 54%, respectively.\n\nInternational donors play a crucial role in this effort, and their support can make a significant difference. By investing in inclusive education and healthcare, providing support for vulnerable families, and promoting family-based care alternatives, children can thrive within their own families and communities.\n\nThe #Letstalklumos campaign, launched by JK Rowling, aims to raise awareness about this critical issue and create a global movement to end the practice of institutionalization. With the support of international donors, experts, and individuals, it is possible to create a world where children are not taken away from their families and locked in institutions, but instead receive the love, care, and support they deserve.\n\nAs JK Rowling puts it, \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\"", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer.

She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue.

The dinosaur, which lived 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, is a crow-sized, bird-like creature with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of researchers led by paleontologist Xing Xu, who found the fossil in the Hebei Province of China. The fossil was exceptionally well-preserved, with the dinosaur's feathers, bones, and even its internal organs still intact. The researchers were able to study the fossil in detail and discovered that Caihong juji had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, which were likely used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals.\n\nThe researchers used powerful microscopes to detect the remnants of melanosomes, the organelles responsible for pigmentation, in the dinosaur's feathers. They found that the melanosomes in Caihong juji's feathers were similar to those found in hummingbirds, which are known for their iridescent feathers. The researchers were able to reconstruct the dinosaur's plumage and found that it had a rainbow of colors, including iridescent blues and greens.\n\nCaihong juji was a two-legged predator with a Velociraptor-like skull and sharp teeth, and it likely hunted small mammals and lizards. It had a unique crest above its eyes, which was likely used for display purposes. The dinosaur's tail was also frond-like, with asymmetrical feathers that would have borne the aerodynamic load of flight.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of birds and dinosaurs. It suggests that dinosaurs were more colorful and complex than previously thought, and that they may have used their feathers for a variety of purposes, including display and flight.\n\nThe researchers were able to study the dinosaur's feathers in detail and found that they were made up of a variety of different types, including pennaceous feathers, which are long and stiff, and down-like feathers, which are soft and fluffy. They also found that the dinosaur's feathers were highly organized, with different types of feathers arranged in a specific pattern.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has also shed new light on the evolution of flight in birds.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

However, critics argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families, and has driven sales outside city limits.\n\nBusinesses, such as Costco, have seen a significant decline in sales of sugary drinks, with a case of Gatorade increasing from $15.99 to $26.33, a 64% increase. Retailers have responded by posting signs directing customers to locations outside the city limits where they can buy the products without the tax. This has led to a loss of revenue for the city, with some businesses reporting a 34% decline in sales.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, exempting sugary drinks with milk as a primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages, and not applying to food stamp purchases. The tax has been compared to the failed Cook County, Illinois, soda tax, which was repealed after just two months due to public outcry.\n\nA bill to implement a similar tax statewide in Washington has been re-introduced, but local businesses are concerned about the potential impact on their sales. Some residents, however, support the tax, citing its potential to discourage people from drinking sugary drinks and improve public health.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of effectiveness in achieving its intended goals. A Twitter thread by the Tax Foundation highlighted the inconsistency in the city's messaging, with public health advocates saying the tax is intended to change behavior, while city officials claim there is no data to support the idea that it will hurt local businesses.\n\nThe tax has been seen as a failure, with shoppers heading out of town to buy sugary drinks and groceries, resulting in a loss of revenue for the city.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Myrna Arias, who worked for Intermex from February to May 2014, claims that her boss, John Stubits, required her to download the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone, which tracked her every move, including her driving speed and routes taken.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours, likening it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet. Stubits allegedly admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged about knowing her driving speed at specific moments.

Arias' attorney, Gail Glick, stated that the app allowed her client's bosses to see every move she made throughout the day, and that there was no way to turn it off when she was at home. Glick also claimed that Intermex's actions were a complete violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy.\n\nThe company, Intermex, has not commented on the matter.

Here are five notable examples:\n\n1. **Anthony Scaramucci**: The former White House Communications Director was fired just 11 days into his tenure in 2017. His tumultuous stint was marked by protocol breaches, conflicting statements, and a profanity-laced interview with The New Yorker. His wife also filed for divorce during his brief time in the White House.\n\n2. **Chris Christie**: The former Governor of New Jersey has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the state's history.

The House of Representatives has approved a plan to delay the start of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and repeal the medical device tax, but Senate Democrats have vowed to reject any changes to the law. President Barack Obama has also stated that he would veto any bill that includes these provisions.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a hardline stance against the ACA, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is determined to block any attempts to gut or delay the law. Reid has taken a tough stance, urging Obama not to engage in direct negotiations with Republicans, and has convinced his caucus to stand firm against any concessions.\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, is expected to be severely impacted by a shutdown. Local economist Stephen Fuller estimates that the region could lose $200 million a day and see over 700,000 jobs affected. The shutdown would also impact tourism, with federally funded attractions such as the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo likely to be closed.\n\nFederal services would also be disrupted, including the processing of new applications for benefits such as Medicare, Social Security, and child-care subsidies. Child-care centers in federal agencies would close, and child-care workers would be sent home. Mail would still be delivered, but planes could be delayed due to the lack of \"nonessential\" support staff.\n\nLocal governments in the Washington region are preparing for the worst, setting aside funds to mitigate the impact of a shutdown. Maryland officials estimate that the state would lose $5 million a day in income tax revenue, while Prince George's County officials say they could lose $270,000 daily.\n\nAs the deadline for passing a spending bill approaches, it is unclear how the situation will be resolved. The House and Senate could agree to a compromise, but it is also possible that a short-term funding bill could be passed to buy more time. Alternatively, a partial government shutdown could occur, which would have significant consequences for the Washington region and the country as a whole.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Mohawk, a well-known and beloved lion, had escaped from Nairobi National Park and was surrounded by hundreds of bystanders, who were taking selfies and throwing rocks at the animal. The rangers, who had initially planned to tranquilize the lion, were forced to shoot it after it became agitated and attacked the man.\n\nThe incident sparked an outcry among Kenyans, with many questioning why the rangers did not try to tranquilize the lion instead of killing it. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) explained that the decision to shoot the lion was taken as a last resort after the situation escalated and public safety was at risk.\n\nMohawk's death is not an isolated incident, as several other lions have escaped from Nairobi National Park in recent weeks. In one incident, a lion mauled a man on a busy street in the capital, while in another, a pride of lions made its way into residential areas in Nairobi, leaving officials scrambling to find them.\n\nThe KWS has attributed the surge in lion escapes to habitat loss, citing the increasing property values in Nairobi and the encroachment of the park by development projects.

The data brokers, which include companies like Acxiom, Experian, and Equifax, collect and sell consumer information to marketers, who use it to target shoppers based on their income, clothing size, and other personal characteristics.\n\nThe report found that some data brokers are selling lists of consumers with specific health conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, and depression, along with their medications. Others are selling lists of people with addictive behaviors towards drug and alcohol, as well as lists of police officers' home addresses, which could put them and their families in harm's way. The data brokers are also selling lists of seniors suffering from dementia, which could open them up to predatory financial offers.\n\nThe World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization, uncovered these lists while investigating how data brokers collect and sell consumer information.

Dixon stated that data brokers are required by federal law to maintain the privacy of a consumer's data only if it is used for credit, employment, insurance, or housing, but that medical information that data brokers get elsewhere is fair game.\n\nThe data brokers argue that they offer ways to opt out, but many have unclear or no opt-out procedures, and most consumers have no idea they're on the lists in the first place.

It is estimated to be 5-10 times the mass of Earth and has a highly elliptical orbit that takes 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine was made by a team of researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006. Brown and his colleague, Konstantin Batygin, used mathematical and computer modeling to infer the existence of the planet, which they believe is responsible for the unusual motion of small, icy bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system.\n\nThe researchers have not directly observed the planet, but they are confident that it exists based on the gravitational influence it has on the smaller objects. They estimate that the planet is about two to four times the diameter of Earth and is likely an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Mike Brown argues that Pluto's demotion was necessary for the good of science and that it is now an interesting member of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.\n\nBrown has stated that he has no regrets about his role in Pluto's demotion and believes that the controversy will eventually die down. He hopes that the New Horizons mission to Pluto will help people understand the solar system in a new way and that the discussion will shift from whether Pluto is a planet to what we have learned about the Kuiper Belt.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, and astronomers are hopeful that it will be detected within the next few years.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over a period of five years, found that those who experienced the largest fluctuations in weight had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased. This can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, emphasized the importance of maintaining weight loss over time. \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off,\" he said. \"Many people are motivated to lose weight, but then they feel they can take it easy. This information can be used as motivation to keep the weight off.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. Researchers have found that people with coronary heart disease who experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death compared to those who experienced little change in body weight.\n\nThe study's results suggest that weight fluctuation may be a concern for people with coronary heart disease, and that maintaining a stable weight may be crucial for reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death. Dr. Bangalore and his team recommend further investigation into the relationship between weight fluctuation and heart health.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Yo-yo dieting may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death in people with coronary artery disease.\n* The study found that those with the largest weight fluctuations had a 78% higher risk of new-onset", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

Presidential historians tell the AP that no president, including Nixon during the Watergate scandal, has publicly turned on the press the way Trump did. \"It was bizarre theater,\" says Rice University history professor Douglas Brinkley. \"He turned a presidential press conference into a reality-TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.\" GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alice Stewart also found a few things to praise in Trump's performance. \"You can't say he's not responsive to the press,\" she tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \"He answered all the questions from all over the press corps and put to rest the long-standing dialogue that he shuts down certain news outlets.\" Vox lists nine moments that it suggests back up Jake Tapper's description of the press conference as \"wild\" and \"unhinged,\" including Trump's claim that \"the leaks are real\" but \"the news is fake.\" Late-night hosts approached the press conference as gleefully as a kid unwrapping Christmas presents, and the Washington Post rounds up some of their best lines. \"My guess is he did it because he's mad and he just wanted to blow off some steam,\" Jimmy Kimmel said. \"The tone of the press conference was like if your dad found a pack of cigarettes under your mattress.\" David Graham at the Atlantic looks at the continual theme of complaint in the conference and wonders: Does Trump hate his new job?"], "all_classes": null, "length": 10933}

The issue occurred when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The valve, which regulates the flow of ammonia coolant, reached a pre-set temperature limit, causing the shutdown.\n\nAccording to NASA, the crew was never in any danger, and the situation is not considered a life-threatening emergency.

The example set by Ricks' forecast has been cited as a model for effective communication during emergency situations.\n\nThe Smithsonian Museum of American History has preserved Ricks' original forecast, along with a rosary from his grandmother that he held onto during the storm, as a testament to the importance of his work and the impact of his forecast on the community.", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day.

{"pred": "**Rising Colorectal Cancer Rates Among Younger Adults: A Growing Concern**\n\nA recent study has shed light on a concerning trend in the United States: colorectal cancer rates are increasing among younger adults, with one in seven cases diagnosed in individuals under the age of 50. This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults.\n\nAccording to the study, which analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011, nearly 15% of patients were under 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment.\n\nResearchers found that younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) compared to older patients. Despite having more advanced disease, younger patients had a higher five-year survival rate, with 95.1% of patients under 50 surviving with localized disease, 76% with regional disease, and 21.3% with distant disease.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. She noted that the medical community should be aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool.\n\nExperts agree that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults are unclear, but potential contributing factors may include environmental factors, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, suggested that the increase may be due to an environmental effect that is contributing to the rise in colon cancer.\n\nWhile the study's findings raise questions about whether screening guidelines should be altered to start at a younger age, experts caution that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of such a change. Dr. Chan noted that the risk of colon cancer is still low among younger adults, and expanding screening to younger age groups may not be necessary at this time.\n\nHowever, the study's findings do highlight the need for increased awareness and vigilance among healthcare providers and the general public. Dr. Hendren emphasized the importance of early detection and treatment, and the need for long-term support for young colorectal cancer survivors.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising rates of colorectal cancer among younger adults are a growing concern that requires attention", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, is located about 550 kilometers north of Adelaide and contains a treasure trove of artefacts and bones from 16 mammals and one reptile. The discovery pushes back the known dates of human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by 10,000 years, challenging previous assumptions about the arrival of the first Australians.\n\nThe site was discovered by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard while surveying the area. Hamm said that the discovery was a chance find, with Coulthard walking up a creek bed to find a spring surrounded by rock art, which led to the discovery of the rock shelter. Excavations at the site have revealed over 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, including burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre, and gypsum pigments.\n\nThe artefacts have been dated to between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago, with radiocarbon dating of burnt eggshells revealing ages between 45,000 and 49,000 years old. The site also contains the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and South-East Asia, dating back to around 49,000-46,000 years ago. The discovery of bones from the extinct giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and eggs from an ancient giant bird suggests that early humans were interacting with Australia's legendary megafauna.\n\nThe find is significant because it challenges the assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world. The discovery of the Warratyi rock shelter also pushes back the dates of the development of key technologies such as bone needles, wood-handled stone tools, and gypsum use.\n\nThe site is also important because it provides evidence of human interaction with megafauna, which has been a topic of debate among archaeologists. The discovery of bones and shells in the rock shelter suggests that early humans were living in close quarters with these animals and bringing them back to the cave.\n\nThe discovery has been hailed as one of the most important in Australian pre-history, and the team behind the study says that it will help rewrite the story of Indigenous Australians.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "**Harnessing the Power of the Universe: A Quest for Energy and Alien Life**\n\nA recent paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper has revived the concept of harnessing energy from distant stars, a notion first proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. According to Kardashev's model, there are three levels of technologically advanced civilizations: Level I, which harnesses all a planet's resources; Level II, which harnesses all a star's radiation; and Level III, which harnesses all a galaxy's resources. Hooper's paper suggests that advanced civilizations would need to capture stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe.\n\nThe universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, causing stars beyond our Local Group of galaxies to fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making them unobservable and inaccessible. Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations would use a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to capture and harvest energy from stars. These satellites would be made up of millions of solar-powered satellites that would hover around a star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to a nearby planet.\n\nThis concept is not new, as science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described similar structures in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker.\" Physicist Freeman Dyson also proposed similar structures in a scientific paper in 1960, suggesting that advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems to capture their star's energy. Dyson spheres would be made up of individual solar-collecting satellites, known as statites, which would hover in space and collect energy from a star.\n\nWhile humans are still in the early stages of harnessing energy from our own star, advanced civilizations millions of years older than ours may have already reached Level III, harnessing the energy of entire galaxies. Hooper suggests that we may be able to detect these civilizations by looking for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away. However, our current instruments may not be precise enough to detect these signatures, and it may be a challenge to develop the technology to do so before our sun becomes another star in a distant civilization's collection.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures has been explored in science fiction, including in the novel \"Ringworld\" by Larry Niven and the TV show \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\" While we may not be able to harness the power of the universe just yet, the idea of advanced civilizations capturing and harvesting energy from stars is", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

{"pred": "Recent archaeological discoveries in East Africa have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have uncovered evidence of a significant shift in toolmaking and trading networks among early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago.\n\nThe discoveries, published in three papers in the journal Science, suggest that Homo sapiens or their close relatives responded to dramatic climate shifts in the region by developing more advanced tools and trading networks. The tools, which include small, sharp stone points and blades, were made from obsidian and other exotic materials brought from distant locations, indicating a level of social organization and cooperation among early human groups.\n\nThe findings challenge the long-held view that modern human behaviors, such as symbolism, innovation, and art, emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago in Africa. Instead, the new evidence suggests that these behaviors arose much earlier, starting in groups that predated Homo sapiens.\n\nThe Olorgesailie discoveries include the oldest known evidence of the extraction of pigments, with bright red ochre found at the site displaying evidence of grinding and cut marks. The presence of obsidian and other exotic materials also indicates long-distance trade networks, which were likely used to acquire resources and share information.\n\nThe researchers propose that the development of these advanced behaviors was driven by the need for early humans to adapt to a changing environment, which included repeated cycles of drought and heavy rainfall. This led to increased mobility and the formation of social networks, which allowed for the exchange of ideas and resources.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the emergence of modern human behavior. They suggest that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern never actually occurred, and that complex behaviors and technological innovation were present in early human societies much earlier than previously thought.\n\nThe discoveries also highlight the importance of considering the African archaeological record in a more nuanced way, rather than relying on a Eurocentric view of human evolution. The findings from Olorgesailie provide a new perspective on the evolution of human behavior and technology, and challenge our current understanding of the emergence of modern humans.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The panda, which had been chased by other villagers, bit Guan's leg, causing severe injuries that required eight surgeries over the past year.\n\nGuan's injuries were so severe that his leg may require amputation, prompting him to sue local government officials and the Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, which is home to over 100 wild pandas. After negotiations, the forestry bureau, the Longnan city government, and the Baishuijiang Natural Reserve agreed to pay Guan 520,000 yuan (approximately $83,000) in compensation.\n\nThis incident serves as a reminder that wild pandas, despite their lovable appearance, are members of the bear family and possess a fearsome bite. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), pandas have strong jaw muscles, large molar teeth, and a heavy weight that allows them to protect themselves. While they are primarily herbivores, feeding on bamboo, their bite can be very painful and potentially serious.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the importance of conservation efforts for wild pandas, which are under pressure from habitat loss and have a notoriously low reproductive rate.

The raids, which took place in August 2011, are the second time Gibson has been targeted by the government, with a similar raid occurring in 2009.\n\nThe Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, where there is a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood. However, Gibson denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Lacey Act has sparked debate in the guitar world, with some, like Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the law as a necessary measure to prevent illegal logging. Others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature, which could force guitar builders to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago.\n\nThe raids have also had a significant impact on the guitar industry, with dealers like George Gruhn of Nashville's George Gruhn Guitars warning of a \"nightmare\" scenario where owners are asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The law also covers the trade in vintage instruments, which has led to a decline in business for Gruhn, who has had to nearly eliminate the 40% of his business that dealt with overseas buyers.\n\nThe EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the Lacey Act, stating that the intent is to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that responsible sourcing of wood is necessary. However, the case against Gibson remains unresolved, with the company awaiting charges and a day in court to clear its name.\n\n**Separately, a related news item notes that Alexa Internet has been donating its crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996, with the data being added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood.

The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was approximately a mile deep in some areas and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding, published by NASA scientists, suggests that Mars was a more promising place for alien life to have emerged.\n\nThe research team used infrared maps to study the Martian atmosphere and found that water near the ice caps is enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. This high concentration of deuterium indicates that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times the amount currently locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The scientists estimate that the ancient ocean would have covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters, but it's believed to have pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean has significant implications for the search for life on Mars. The longer water persists on a planetary body, the more likely it is to provide a habitable environment for life to originate or proliferate. An ocean would meet this need, and the evidence suggests that Mars was wet for a much longer time than previously thought.\n\nThe study also found that the ordinary hydrogen in Martian water has been gradually leaking into space over time, leading to a higher proportion of deuterium in the planet's water. This process can be used to estimate the amount of water that once existed on Mars, which would have been enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of 450 feet (137 meters) if it had been evenly distributed.\n\nWhile the evidence continues to mount that Mars was once a wet and habitable planet, it's still unclear whether life ever existed on the Red Planet. However, the discovery of an ancient ocean and the increasing signs of a hospitable chemical environment suggest that the possibility of life on Mars is becoming more plausible. The search for life on Mars will continue with the upcoming European Space Agency's Exomars rover mission in 2018, which will look for chemical signatures of life in the Martian soil.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The film, starring Will Smith and Margot Robbie, is a caper about a veteran con man and his young apprentice. The movie's plot is described as ridiculous and absurd, with a lack of truth and no real revelation of the secret underworld it claims to expose. However, the film's charm lies in its audacity and the performances of its leads.\n\nThe casting of the film was a highly publicized process, with several A-list actors considered for the lead roles. Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck were all considered for the role of the con man, while Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, and Kristen Stewart were among those considered for the female lead. Ultimately, Will Smith and Margot Robbie were cast in the roles, with Smith bringing his signature charm to the character of Nicky Spurgeon.\n\nThe film's directors, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, aimed to create a movie that captures the effortless allure of a classic Hitchcock film. They succeeded in bringing out the best in Smith, who is able to play his character with ease and charm. Margot Robbie also shines in the film, bringing a modern take on the classic \"damsel in distress\" trope.\n\nThe movie's success lies in its ability to balance humor and drama, with a lighthearted tone that makes it enjoyable to watch. The film's R rating allows for some raunchy humor, which adds to its playful and carefree atmosphere. Overall, \"Focus\" is a fun and entertaining film that is worth watching for its performances and its lighthearted take on the con man genre.\n\nThe film's themes of confidence and persuasion are also explored, with Nicky's ability to convince anyone of anything being a key part of his character. This theme is reminiscent of Smith's own career, which began as a rapper and was cemented by his role in the hit TV show \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\" Smith's ability to charm his way into high society has been a hallmark of his career, and it serves him well in this film.\n\nOverall, \"Focus\" is a fun and entertaining film that is worth watching for its performances, its lighthearted tone, and its exploration of themes of confidence and persuasion.", "answers": ["Will Smith stars as Nicky, an established con man who takes on a new apprentice, Australian newcomer Margot Robbie's Jess, in Focus.

The case revolves around the shape of the Kit Kat finger wafer, which Nestlé has been fighting to trademark in the European Union (EU) for over a decade.\n\nThe ECJ ruling sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) to review a 2012 decision that upheld Nestlé's trademark on the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit. Mondelez, the owner of Cadbury, had objected to the trademark, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be protected.\n\nThe ECJ found that Nestlé failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive, but also dismissed Mondelez's appeal against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016. This leaves open the possibility that the EUIPO could still preserve protection for Kit Kat's shape, taking into account new evidence that the shape is distinctive to people in more countries.\n\nThe trademark dispute has significant implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The case has also been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has featured in Britain's Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat.\n\nThe dispute has been ongoing since 2002, when Nestlé applied for a trademark in Europe for the Kit Kat shape. Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, has been fighting against the trademark, arguing that it is not distinctive enough. The case has seen several appeals and counter-appeals, with the ECJ's ruling sending the case back to the EUIPO for further review.\n\nThe outcome of the case is still uncertain, but it is likely to have significant implications for the chocolate industry and trademark law in the EU. Nestlé has stated that it believes the EU trademark office will side with the company, but Mondelez has welcomed the ECJ's ruling, saying that it is a victory for consumers and the chocolate industry.\n\nThe case has also highlighted the complexities of trademark law in the EU, where companies must prove that their products are distinctive enough to be protected across all member states.

According to researchers, the sounds made by dinosaurs were likely more similar to those of birds, with a low, throaty whoosh of air, often referred to as \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" This type of vocalization is characterized by a low-frequency sound produced by pushing air into an esophageal pouch rather than exhaling through an open beak.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization, which is often associated with territorial or courtship displays. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe study's findings are based on a statistical analysis of the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups. The researchers found that only animals with a relatively large body size, such as doves and ostriches, use closed-mouth vocalization. This suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs.\n\nThe researchers also found that the association with large body size is a matter of physics, as the inflation of an elastic cavity requires a certain level of lung pressure, which increases for smaller body sizes. This means that dinosaurs with large body sizes, such as the Tyrannosaurus rex, may have been able to produce closed-mouth vocalizations.\n\nThe study's findings offer a new perspective on the sounds made by dinosaurs, which are often depicted as roaring ferociously in movies and popular culture. According to the researchers, dinosaurs may have made sounds more similar to those of birds, with a low, throaty whoosh of air. This is a significant departure from the traditional depiction of dinosaurs as loud, roaring creatures.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, said that the demonstration of closed-mouth behavior evolving many times suggests that it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays. The study's findings also suggest that dinosaurs may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds, which is a far cry from the traditional depiction of dinosaurs as loud, roaring creatures.\n\nThe study's results have implications for our understanding of the evolution of bird vocalizations and the sounds made by extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

However, the use of Bayesian statistics, a mathematical technique developed by 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, has been instrumental in solving a similar mystery in the past. In 2009, a team of statisticians from Metron Inc. used Bayesian statistics to locate the wreckage of Air France Flight 447, which had been missing for two years.\n\n**Bayesian Statistics: A Powerful Tool**\n\nBayesian statistics is a method of analyzing data by assigning probabilities to different scenarios. It allows for the combination of multiple pieces of information, including contradictory ones, to arrive at a most likely solution. This approach is particularly useful in search operations, where new information is constantly being gathered. By updating the probability map based on new data, Bayesian statistics can help refine the search area and increase the chances of finding the target.\n\n**The Air France Case**\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, the statisticians from Metron Inc. were called in to help locate the wreckage. They used Bayesian statistics to assess the likelihood of different scenarios, including mechanical failures and pilot error. By combining the data and updating the probability map, they were able to narrow down the search area to a much smaller region. Although the initial search efforts were unsuccessful, the statisticians were asked to make a second attempt, and this time, they found the wreckage.\n\n**The Challenge of Finding MH370**\n\nThe disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 presents a similar challenge. The search area is vast, and the currents in the Indian Ocean are unpredictable. Colleen Keller, a senior analyst at Metron Inc., who worked on the Air France case, believes that the plane is likely to be at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and may never be found. She notes that even finding debris may not mean finding the bulk of the plane, as the wreckage may have been scattered over a large area.\n\n**The Role of Bayesian Statistics in Search Operations**\n\nBayesian statistics has been used in various search operations, including the hunt for U-boats in World War II and the search for a U.S. submarine in the 1960s. The technique has also been used in the search for plane-crash debris and sunken treasure. In the case of MH370, Bayesian statistics can help refine the search area and increase the chances of finding the plane.

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time. They changed their findings, and presto, the plane was found.

This event is a combination of a Blue Moon, a Supermoon, and a total lunar eclipse, making it a unique and spectacular sight.\n\n**What is a Blue Moon?**\nA Blue Moon occurs when there are two full moons in a single month, which happens approximately every 2.7 years. The second full moon in a month is called a Blue Moon.\n\n**What is a Supermoon?**\nA Supermoon is a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon.\n\n**What is a Total Lunar Eclipse?**\nA total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's light from reaching the moon.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes.

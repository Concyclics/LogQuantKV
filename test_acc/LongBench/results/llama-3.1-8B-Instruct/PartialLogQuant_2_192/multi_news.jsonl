{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Rise of Superbugs: New Research Reveals Alarming Link**\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the alarming relationship between cigarette smoke and the virulence of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Research conducted by the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine has found that cigarette smoke fuels the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in invading human cells.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at the University of California, San Diego, cigarette smoke acts as an alarm to the bacteria, triggering stress responses that make them more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is not only seen in lab studies but also in real-world scenarios, where cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was found to be four times more resistant to the immune system's killing mechanisms.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to reactive oxygen species, a key component of the immune system's defense against pathogens. Additionally, the bacteria were more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are essential for killing bacteria. Furthermore, the study found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more adept at adhering to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to invade and cause infections.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms the smoker's respiratory and immune systems but also makes the bacteria more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This alarming discovery highlights the need for individuals to refrain from smoking to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nA previous study conducted by the same research team found that e-cigarette vapor also increased the virulence of MRSA, but the effects were less pronounced compared to cigarette smoke.

The research highlights the need for individuals to avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Cigarette smoke fuels the virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics and the immune system.\n* Cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was four times more resistant to the immune system's defenses.\n* Cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides.\n* C", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

This phenomenon is not only a moral outrage but also a preventable problem. The shocking truth is that most of these children could be with their families if there was support for family-based care and alternative solutions to institutions.\n\nLumos, a charity founded by JK Rowling, aims to eradicate the practice of institutionalizing children worldwide. The organization has made significant progress in countries like Moldova, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70% since 2007. Similar successes have been achieved in Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has dropped by 54%, and in the Czech Republic, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 16% in the past year.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization on children are severe and long-lasting, including malnutrition, stunted growth, developmental delays, and increased risk of abuse and trafficking. Children with disabilities are particularly vulnerable, as they are often taken away from their families due to a lack of support and resources.\n\nHowever, there is hope. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated by 2050, and countries like Bulgaria and Moldova have already made significant progress in reducing the number of children in institutions.

The investigator, Eusebio Felix, claimed that the gang, known as the \"Pishtacos,\" had murdered up to 60 people and sold their fat to the cosmetics industry for thousands of dollars a liter.\n\nThe claims, which were made last month, sparked widespread attention and fear in Peru, with the police displaying what they said was human fat in bottles and a photo of a decapitated head.

However, this influx of hikers has raised concerns about overcrowding, environmental damage, and the strain on local communities.\n\nAccording to the Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA), the number of hikers has increased dramatically, with over 4,000 long-distance permits issued in 2016, a significant jump from previous years. The PCTA has implemented a quota system to manage the number of hikers, capping the number of daily permits at 50. However, this may not be enough to mitigate the impact of the crowds.\n\nThe PCT has traditionally been a place for self-discovery and personal growth, but the increasing number of hikers has raised concerns about the trail's fragile ecosystem and the potential for damage.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

However, the tax has been deemed regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and driving sales to neighboring cities and suburbs.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed in December 2018 after a public outcry and a significant decline in sales.

The tax was seen as a burden on low-income families and small businesses, with some retailers reporting a 34% decline in sales.\n\nIn Seattle, the tax has led to a significant increase in prices, with a case of Gatorade going from $15.99 to $26.33.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear.

The app, Xora, was required by her employer to track her every move, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Arias, a sales executive, claimed that the app was an invasion of her privacy and likened it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias was a high-performing employee, earning $7,250 per month, and had met all her job quotas. However, she objected to the app's GPS function, which tracked her location during non-work hours, and complained to her boss, John Stubits, about the intrusion.

The standoff has been brewing for weeks, with the House and Senate unable to agree on a plan to keep the government running. The current impasse centers on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, with the House Republicans pushing for a one-year delay in the law's implementation and a repeal of the medical device tax.\n\n**House Republicans' Plan**\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has proposed a spending bill that includes a one-year delay in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and a repeal of the medical device tax.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Researchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 (15%) of them were under 50. This trend is a \"wake-up call\" to the medical community, according to Dr. Samantha Hendren, a lead researcher at the University of Michigan.\n\n**Current Guidelines and Findings**\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend that people start screening for colorectal cancer at age 50. However, the study's findings suggest that this age may be too late for some individuals. Younger patients (under 50) were more likely to have advanced cancer and were diagnosed with tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. Despite this, they lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence, with 95% of patients under 50 surviving five years without a recurrence, compared to 92% of patients over 50.\n\n**Treatment Patterns and Outcomes**\n\nYounger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) than older patients. They also had higher five-year survival rates for all stages of cancer, including:\n\n* Localized disease: 95.1% (under 50) vs. 91.9% (50+)\n* Lymph node involvement: 76% (under 50) vs. 70% (50+)\n* Metastasis to other organs: 21% (under 50) vs. 14% (50+)\n\n**Risk Factors and Recommendations**\n\nThe study's findings raise questions about the current guidelines for screening. Dr. Hendren notes that patients under 50 are more likely to have advanced cancer, but also live longer without recurrence. Dr. David Weinberg suggests that the study's findings may not support expanding screening to younger age groups, citing the low incidence of colon cancer in this age group.\n\n**Recommendations for Early Detection**\n\nThe study's findings highlight the need for early detection of colorectal cancer in younger patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

It's \"daring, sophisticated and unforgettably disturbing.\" And \"in scale, scope and the space it offers for a long-awaited moral reckoning, it's nothing less than monumental.\" \"It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is,\" writes Lindsey Bahr at the AP, calling Detroit \"a well-made and evocative film\" jam-packed with \"stomach-churning horror.\" She argues there could be more nuance and perspective. But \"maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater.

The three stages of galactic expansion, or \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations, are:\n\n1. **Type I**: Harnessing all of a planet's resources.\n2. **Type II**: Harnessing all the energy of a star.\n3. **Type III**: Harnessing all the energy of a galaxy.\n\nAccording to Hooper, a civilization must expand its reach to capture stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of the universe. This is because the universe's dark energy is causing space to expand at an alarming rate, making it difficult for civilizations to access energy from distant stars.\n\n**Detecting Alien Civilizations**\n\nAstrophysicist Freeman Dyson proposed a method to harness energy from a star by creating a cloud of satellites, or \"Dyson spheres,\" around the star. This would allow the civilization to capture and harness the energy of the star. However, this would require a significant amount of energy and resources.\n\n**Alien Star-Harvesting**\n\nTo detect alien civilizations, scientists would look for signs of energy harvesting, such as:\n\n* **Dyson spheres**: A cloud of satellites surrounding a star, collecting its energy.\n* **Infrared radiation**: The radiation emitted by a star being harnessed by a civilization.\n* **Massive stars**: Stars with masses 20-100 times that of our sun, which would be the most likely candidates for energy harvesting.\n\n**The Search for Aliens**\n\nThe search for alien civilizations is a complex task, but scientists believe that advanced civilizations would be able to harness energy from other stars and galaxies. This would leave a signature in the light emitted by the star, which could be detectable by astronomers.\n\n**The Future of Energy Harvesting**\n\nWhile we are still far from achieving Type III energy harvesting, scientists believe that advanced civilizations would be able to harness energy from other galaxies. This would require a significant amount of energy and resources, but it would also provide a means to detect alien civilizations.\n\n**The Search for Alien Life**\n\nThe search for alien life is an ongoing effort, and scientists are using various methods to detect signs of life, such as:\n\n* **Dyson spheres**: Clouds of satellites surrounding a star, collecting its energy.\n*", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them.\" Head writer Ben Karlin: \"I remember seeing it in the editing room. I remember Jon called me down, and seeing it and thinking, Yeah, this is what we should be doing. This is the goal. It was one of Carell’s most incredible moments. He asks McCain a question in a way that no journalists were talking to the candidates. And it was like, Oh s---, we are able, in this weird, unintentional way, to add a level of insight to the process that doesn’t exist. That was really, really exciting.\" Click for the full piece, in which Stewart talks about how that 2000 campaign provided his \"aha moment\" of how to present the show—by \"deconstructing the process.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 7229}

A team of researchers, led by paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, has found evidence of the Middle Stone Age, a period characterized by the use of smaller, more specialized stone tools, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This discovery challenges the long-held view that the Middle Stone Age began around 200,000 years ago.\n\nThe team's findings, published in three papers in the journal Science, suggest that early humans in the region were able to adapt to changing environments by developing new technologies and social networks. The researchers found that the tools were made from obsidian, a rare and valuable material, which was transported from 15 to 55 kilometers away. This indicates that early humans were able to travel long distances and share knowledge and resources.\n\nThe discovery also suggests that early humans were able to use pigments, such as red and black rocks, to create symbolic tools and possibly even paint themselves or their hides. The team believes that this was a result of climate change, which forced early humans to adapt and innovate.\n\nThe findings also suggest that early humans were able to develop complex social networks, which allowed them to share resources and knowledge. This is supported by the discovery of brightly colored rocks, which were likely used for symbolic purposes.\n\nThe discovery of the Middle Stone Age in Africa, which is characterized by the use of smaller, more specialized tools, has been a long-standing debate among researchers. Some researchers have argued that the Middle Stone Age began around 200,000 years ago, while others have suggested that it began earlier.\n\nThe new discoveries suggest that the Middle Stone Age began around 320,000 years ago, and that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments and develop new technologies.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

The new law also paves the way for the establishment of a medical cannabis industry, allowing for the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe legislation, which was passed by the Jamaican parliament, makes Jamaica the latest country to relax its laws on marijuana. The move follows a long-standing debate on the issue, with previous efforts to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana being scuttled due to concerns about violating international treaties and incurring sanctions from Washington.\n\nThe new law will allow for the cultivation of up to five plants on private premises, and the use of marijuana for medical purposes, including the creation of marijuana-derived products such as \"Canasol,\" which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients. The law also permits the use of marijuana for religious purposes, including for Rastafarian adherents.\n\nThe move is seen as a significant step towards Jamaica's goal of becoming a player in the medical cannabis industry, health tourism, and the development of innovative products derived from marijuana. The country hopes to capitalize on the growing demand for medical marijuana, with the industry expected to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.\n\nThe new law does not, however, mean that Jamaica plans to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of marijuana for illicit purposes. The country's national security minister, Peter Bunting, emphasized that the government remains committed to combating and dismantling organizations involved in drug trafficking.\n\nThe move follows a trend of relaxation of marijuana laws in other countries, including the United States, where several states have legalized the use of marijuana for medical and recreational purposes. In the Americas, Uruguay and Argentina have also relaxed their laws on marijuana, with Uruguay becoming the first nation to establish a legal marijuana market.\n\nThe new law in Jamaica will allow tourists to apply for permits to buy small amounts of ganja, and the country's commerce minister, Anthony Hylton, sees the industry as a potential source of revenue and job creation.

However, the company's director of forest programs, Andrea Johnson, says that Gibson understood the risks of sourcing wood from endangered species and chose to continue doing so.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also affected other guitar manufacturers, with some owners of vintage instruments facing the possibility of being asked to prove the origin of their wood. The law's retroactive nature has raised concerns among guitar builders and owners, who fear that they may be held accountable for wood sourced decades ago.\n\nThe law has also had a significant impact on the music industry, with some companies and individuals choosing to avoid the risks associated with sourcing wood from endangered species.

The findings, published in the journal Science, suggest that an ancient sea at least 137 meters deep once covered nearly half of the Martian surface, with the water pooling in the northern hemisphere. This ancient ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was a result of the planet's weak gravity, which allowed water to escape into space, leaving behind a higher concentration of deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen) in the Martian water.\n\nThe study, led by NASA scientists, used infrared telescopes to analyze the Martian atmosphere and determine the amount of water that had been lost over time. The results indicate that Mars had a significant amount of water, equivalent to an ocean 137 meters deep, which would have covered nearly half of the Martian surface. This ancient sea, which was at least 20 meters deep, was likely formed by the pooling of water in the northern hemisphere, where the Martian surface is relatively flat.\n\nThe study suggests that Mars was a wet and warm planet, with flowing streams, rivers, and lakes, and that the water was present for millions of years.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

His family, including his wife and two children, were in hiding after ISIS fighters had taken over their village and killed many men.

According to the study, dinosaurs likely made low, throaty sounds, similar to those made by birds, rather than the high-pitched screams often associated with them. The researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the vocalizations of birds and other reptiles, and found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which involve pushing air into an inhaled esophageal pouch, are more common in large-bodied birds and may have evolved independently in different species.\n\nThe study's findings are based on the analysis of 208 bird species, with 52 of them exhibiting closed-mouth vocalizations. The researchers found that this behavior is more common in large-bodied birds, such as ostriches and doves, and is often used for mating or territorial displays. The study's lead author, Tobias Riede, suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization may have evolved independently in different species, including birds, crocodiles, and dinosaurs.\n\nGary Rydstrom, a sound designer who worked on the movie \"Jurassic Park,\" has also shed light on the sounds of dinosaurs.

This achievement marks a significant step towards decoding the brain's internal workings, including dreams, memories, and even fantasies.\n\nThe study involved researchers lying inside an MRI machine while watching YouTube videos. The brain activity was recorded and used to build a model that matched visual patterns with brain activity.

{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs**\n\nRecent studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have revealed a disturbing connection between cigarette smoke and the virulence of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). \n\nAccording to the research, cigarette smoke acts as an alarm to the bacteria, triggering stress responses that make them more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is not limited to the bacteria's ability to withstand antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, but also allows them to adhere more effectively to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to cause infections and diseases. \n\nIn a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander and her team found that cigarette smoke exposed MRSA bacteria to be four times more resistant to the immune system's defenses than non-exposed bacteria. This increased resistance was observed in both human cells and mice, with the smoke-exposed bacteria also showing increased ability to cause pneumonia and other infections.\n\nThe study also found that the effects of cigarette smoke on MRSA were more pronounced than those of e-cigarette vapor, with the smoke-exposed bacteria showing a 10 times greater increase in cell wall changes compared to e-cigarette vapor. The study suggests that cigarette smoke can make MRSA more resistant to the immune system, leading to increased risk of infections and disease.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, particularly for smokers who are more susceptible to infectious diseases.

Two recent examples highlight the issue: Samsung's new smart TV and Microsoft's Xbox One.\n\n**Samsung's Smart TV Policy**\n\nSamsung's new smart TV policy has sparked controversy due to its ability to listen in on users' conversations, even when the TV is turned off. The policy allows the company to collect voice data, including voice commands, and transmit it to third-party services. This has drawn comparisons to George Orwell's 1984, where the government is always watching and listening to citizens. The policy states that users can opt out of voice recognition features, but this will prevent them from using the feature. The data collected is encrypted, and users can choose to disable the feature. However, the TV will still collect data on how users interact with the device.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The app, Xora, was required by her employer to track her every move, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Arias' lawyer, Gail Glick, stated that the app was designed to track employees' locations, even when they were off-duty, and that employees were not allowed to turn it off. \n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Kern County Superior Court, alleges that Arias' employer, John Stubits, admitted to monitoring employees' locations while off-duty and bragged about knowing her driving speed and routes.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The discovery of a new planet, dubbed \"Planet Nine,\" has been making headlines in the scientific community. The planet, which is believed to be almost as big as Neptune, is thought to be lurking in the outer reaches of our solar system, far beyond the orbit of Pluto.\n\nThe discovery was made by Mike Brown, a Caltech astronomer who is known for his role in Pluto's demotion from the status of a planet. Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, have been searching for evidence of the planet's existence by analyzing the orbits of small, icy bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system. Their research, published in the Astronomical Journal, suggests that the planet is about 20 times farther away from the sun than Neptune and takes about 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete one orbit around the sun.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine, as it's been dubbed, is based on mathematical and computer modeling, and astronomers believe it could be almost as massive as Pluto. The researchers estimate that the planet is about 5,000 times the mass of Pluto, making it a true planet. The researchers believe that the planet is an icy, rocky world with a highly elliptical orbit, making it difficult to spot. The planet's mass is estimated to be 5-10 times that of Earth, making it a significant discovery.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about Pluto's status as a planet. Some scientists argue that Pluto's demotion was necessary to maintain the integrity of the solar system. Pluto's demotion was based on the definition of a planet, which requires it to have a significant mass and clear the neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto does not meet this criterion, as it is part of a larger group of small, icy bodies in the Kuiper Belt.\n\nHowever, the debate has been ongoing, with some scientists arguing that Pluto's demotion was necessary to maintain the integrity of the solar system. Mike Brown, the astronomer who discovered Pluto, has stated that he has no regrets about Pluto's demotion, saying that it was necessary to correct the classification of Pluto.\n\nThe debate surrounding Pluto's status has been ongoing, with some scientists arguing that it should be reinstated as a planet.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

According to the study, nearly 15% of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer are under 50, which is a significant increase from previous estimates. This trend raises questions about the current guidelines for screening and treatment of colorectal cancer.\n\nResearchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that younger patients (under 50) are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, with 37,847 patients (about 15% of the total) diagnosed with cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes, and 50% more likely to have cancer that had spread to other organs. Despite this, younger patients tend to live longer without a cancer recurrence, with 5-year survival rates ranging from 21% to 95% depending on the stage of cancer.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, suggests that younger patients are more likely to receive aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation, which may contribute to their longer survival rates.

This is because the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, and eventually, the stars beyond our galaxy will be inaccessible.\n\nTo achieve this, a civilization would need to create a network of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to collect energy from the star.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

I was watching her,\" co-star Robyn Adamson says. \"Later, when I was told about what happened, I knew exactly what it was.\" \"There was never any doubt. He was this guy who was already known for making inappropriate comments, being drunk, being high,\" says production assistant Roi Maufas. \"Then this happens. Guys reached for hammers,\" he says. Producers say Sizemore, who was ordered to leave the set, denied the allegations. Crew members say the girl's parents spoke to police, but ended up not pressing charges, possibly out of fear of ruining her film career.

On January 3, Indonesian officials announced that they had found four massive objects on the ocean floor, believed to be part of the plane's body. The largest object, measuring 18 meters long and 5 meters wide, is thought to be part of the plane's body. The discovery has raised hopes that many of the passengers and crew may still be trapped inside the plane.\n\n**Cause of the Crash**\n\nThe cause of the crash remains unclear, but weather appears to have played a significant role. The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency reported that the plane flew into bad weather, which would have been difficult to avoid.

Scientists have discovered that an ancient ocean, at least 137 meters deep, covered nearly half of the Martian surface, with the water being enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. This ancient ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was a significant portion of the Martian water, with the water covering nearly half of the planet's surface. The ocean was formed when the Martian atmosphere was much thicker, allowing for a deeper water pool in the northern hemisphere, creating a vast ocean that covered nearly half of the planet's surface.\n\n**Water Loss and Deuterium Enrichment**\n\nThe loss of water on Mars is linked to the escape of ordinary hydrogen into space, leaving behind deuterium, which is enriched in the Martian atmosphere. This process has led to the formation of a global ocean, nearly 450 feet deep, in the Martian polar caps. The deuterium enrichment is a result of the water loss, which has been estimated to be around 6 times higher than the current amount of water in the Martian ice caps.\n\n**Ancient Mars: A Wet and Habitable Planet**\n\nThe ancient Martian atmosphere, which was rich in water, has been studied using the most powerful telescopes in the world.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

The search area is vast, spanning thousands of square miles of the Indian Ocean, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the plane.\n\nIn a similar case, Air France Flight 447, which disappeared in 2009, was located using Bayesian statistics, a method developed by Thomas Bayes in the 18th century. The method uses Bayesian statistics to analyze the available data and update the probability of the plane's location based on new information. The method involves assessing the probability of each scenario, including contradictory ones, and combining them to find the most likely solution.\n\nIn 2009, a team of statisticians from Metron Inc. used Bayesian statistics to help locate the plane. They divided the search area into a grid and applied a probability to each cell, taking into account the uncertainty of the data. The team, led by Colleen Keller, used the Bayesian approach to update their model and adjust the probability of the plane's location based on new information.\n\nThe team's initial search area was a 40-mile radius of the last known location of the plane.

The team then adjusted their model to account for this new information, and a team returned to the area, where they found the plane.\n\nThe method used by the team is called Bayesian statistics, named after Thomas Bayes, a British Presbyterian minister who developed the concept of probability.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3608}

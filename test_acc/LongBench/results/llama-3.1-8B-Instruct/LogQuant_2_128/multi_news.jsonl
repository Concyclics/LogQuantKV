{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs**\n\nRecent studies have revealed a disturbing link between cigarette smoke and the virulence of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have discovered that cigarette smoke can fuel the virulent rampage of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This alarming finding suggests that cigarette smoke not only harms the smoker's respiratory and immune systems but also makes the bacteria more aggressive and resistant to antibiotics.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at the University of California, San Diego, and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, cigarette smoke can stress MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls and become more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This increased resistance makes it harder for the body to kill the bacteria, leading to more severe infections.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was four times more resistant to the immune system's defenses than non-exposed MRSA. Furthermore, the smoke-exposed bacteria were more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making them more likely to cause severe infections.\n\nThe study also compared the effects of cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor on MRSA. While both types of smoke made the bacteria more aggressive, cigarette smoke was found to be more potent, making the bacteria 10 times more resistant to cell wall changes than e-cigarette vapor.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke can be a contributing factor in the increased resistance of MRSA to antibiotics, making it more challenging to treat infections. The study's results have significant implications for public health, particularly for smokers who are more susceptible to infectious diseases.\n\nThe study's findings also highlight the importance of refraining from smoking to prevent the spread of superbugs. As Dr. Crotty Alexander said, \"Cigarette smoke is like a warning signal to the bacteria, making them more aggressive and resistant to the immune system.\"", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough. But it turns out that something can make them even nastier: cigarette smoke. Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia.

When Forbes told Ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, Ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about—in the amount of \"more than $2 billion,\" assets Ross said he put into the trusts sometime \"between the election and [my] nomination.\" When Forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, Ross cited \"privacy issues\"—and the magazine lays out other problems with Ross' story on the supposed $2 billion transfer.

He is now seeking $25,000 a month in spousal support and a share of Frances' earnings from business deals.\n\nIn a separate development, Frances has been ordered to pay Isaiah $25,000 a month in spousal support, but he is now asking a judge to make her pay up, claiming she is trying to renege on her promises.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The Manchester Evening News reports Gary heard his wife fall, got to safety, and called for help. Rescuers found the 53-year-old librarian's body at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff with a fractured skull. At a hearing Friday, Jane's was ruled an accidental death due, in part, to using an app instead of a map. \"Apart from potential difficulties caused by poor detail on an electronic map, batteries on mobile phones have a nasty habit of running out just when you need them most,\" the Telegraph quotes a spokesperson for Mountain Rescue England and Wales as saying. A detective says the app map \"would have been small and not as detailed\" and took the couple on a route that was not the safest. A director with Ordnance Survey says hikers should always use the app in conjunction with an actual map \"due to the nature of mobile devices when navigating the real world.\" Authorities also say Jane wasn't wearing appropriate footwear for the hike.

However, the tax has been a disaster, with many residents voting with their wallets and buying sugary drinks outside the city limits. The tax has been particularly burdensome, with a case of Gatorade increasing from $15.99 to $26.33, a 64% increase.\n\nBusinesses, including Costco, have seen significant declines in sales of sugary drinks, with some experiencing declines of up to 47% in sales. The tax has also led to a surge in sales of sugary drinks in the suburbs, where the tax is not applied. Retailers, including Costco, have put up signs directing customers to nearby locations outside the city limits where they can buy the same products without the tax. The tax has also led to a decline in revenue for the city, as residents opt to buy their drinks in the suburbs.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for being regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families who rely on sugary drinks as a cheap source of hydration. The tax has also been criticized for not applying to artificially sweetened drinks, such as those sold at Starbucks.\n\nThe city of Seattle has seen a significant decline in revenue from the tax, with some businesses opting to adjust their prices to reflect the tax.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Simpson, now 70, appeared before a parole board in Nevada and expressed remorse for his role in the crime, stating that he had \"done my time\" and had been a model prisoner. He was found guilty of kidnapping, robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon in a 2007 incident at a Las Vegas hotel room, where he attempted to reclaim family heirlooms and personal items.\n\nSimpson's parole hearing was reminiscent of his infamous 1995 murder trial, where he was acquitted of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. The case remains a significant cultural touchstone, with themes of justice, celebrity, and racial tensions still resonating today.\n\nSimpson's parole was granted unanimously by the Nevada parole board, with Chairman Connie Bisbee stating that Simpson was a \"low risk to reoffend.\" Simpson's family members, including his daughter Arnelle, testified in his favor, and even the victim of the robbery, Bruce Fromong, advocated for his release.\n\nSimpson's parole comes after a 2013 parole hearing, where he expressed regret for his actions and took responsibility for the crime.

Another board member noted that he hadn't taken an alcohol-abuse program as he promised he would at his last hearing.

On the day before the storm, National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a dire weather forecast that has become a benchmark for weather warnings. The bulletin, which was titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE,\" predicted catastrophic damage and widespread destruction, stating that \"MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS. AT LEAST ONE HALF OF WELL-CONSTRUCTED HOMES WILL HAVE ROOF AND WALL FAILURE. ALL NATIVE TREES WILL BE SNAPPED OR UPROOTED.\" The forecast was a call to action, urging people to evacuate the area.\n\nThe forecast was a result of Ricks' experience and expertise, having grown up in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, which was devastated by Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Camille in 1969. Ricks, who rode out the storm with his colleagues, said that he \"would rather have been wrong\" in his predictions, but the devastation was unprecedented.\n\nThe forecast was a turning point in the National Weather Service's approach to weather forecasting, encouraging meteorologists to use bold and direct language to convey the severity of the situation. The use of such language has been encouraged in recent years, with meteorologists like Gary Szatkowski using similar language during the 2012 New York City area landfall of Hurricane Sandy.\n\nThe aftermath of the storm was a heart-wrenching sight, with widespread destruction and loss of life.

On September 3, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test, which was described as the most powerful detonation yet, with seismological data indicating a hydrogen bomb was used. The test was met with widespread condemnation from the international community, including the United States, South Korea, and Japan.\n\n**North Korea's ICBM Plans**\n\nAccording to a South Korean lawmaker, North Korea may be preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that could be paired with a nuclear warhead. The ICBM would be capable of striking the United States. However, experts say it's unclear if the warhead and missile can be paired successfully.\n\n**South Korea's Response**\n\nIn response to the nuclear test, South Korea's Navy conducted live-fire drills off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. The drills were aimed at checking the country's operational readiness. The South Korean Navy also announced that it would conduct a live-fire drill in the waters off the east coast.\n\n**International Condemnation**\n\nThe international community has condemned North Korea's nuclear test, with the United States, Japan, and South Korea calling for stronger sanctions against the country. The United Nations has also condemned the test, with the US and South Korea conducting joint military drills in response.\n\n**US-South Korea Alliance**\n\nDespite the international condemnation, the US and South Korea have shown a united front against North Korea.

Researchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 (15%) of them were under 50 years old. This trend is raising questions about the current guidelines for screening, which recommend starting at age 50.\n\n**Current Guidelines and Findings**\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend that people start screening for colorectal cancer at age 50. However, the study found that younger patients (under 50) are more likely to have advanced cancer and are more likely to be diagnosed with tumors that have spread to other parts of the body. Despite this, younger patients tend to live longer without cancer recurrence after treatment.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n- 37,847 (15%) of patients under 50 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011.\n- Younger patients are more likely to have advanced cancer and are more likely to be diagnosed with tumors that have spread to other parts of the body.\n- Younger patients are more likely to have surgery and radiation therapy.\n- Younger patients tend to live longer without cancer recurrence after treatment.\n- The five-year survival rate for patients under 50 is higher than for those over 50, with 21.3% of patients under 50 living without cancer recurrence after five years.\n\n**Implications and Recommendations**\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the medical community should be more vigilant in screening for colorectal cancer in younger people. Dr. Samantha Hendren, the study's lead author, notes that doctors should be on the lookout for symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel movements, and bleeding in the stool. Dr. Hendren also suggests that doctors should consider screening patients under 50 with a family history of colorectal cancer.\n\nDr. David Weinberg notes that the study's findings do not necessarily mean that screening should start at an earlier age, but rather that the current guidelines should be reevaluated. Dr. David Geffen, a cancer expert, notes that the study's findings are a wake-up call for the medical community to be more vigilant in screening for colorectal cancer in younger people.\n\n**Recommendations for Future Research**\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the medical community should consider the need", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

As the universe expands, stars beyond our local group will become inaccessible, and a civilization must capture and harness the energy of other stars to prevent being left behind.\n\n**The Challenge of Universal Expansion**\n\nThe universe's accelerating expansion, driven by dark energy, will eventually make it impossible to access energy from stars beyond our local group.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR.

They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

The country's parliament has passed a law that makes possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) of marijuana a petty offense, punishable by a fine rather than a criminal record. This move is seen as a major victory for Jamaican lawmakers, who have been debating the issue for decades.\n\nThe new law, which was passed by the Jamaican parliament, also establishes a licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The law will allow for the cultivation of up to five plants on private premises and permit the use of marijuana for medical purposes, including the creation of marijuana-derived products.\n\nThe law is a significant step forward for Jamaica, which has long been known for its cultural association with marijuana. The Rastafarian movement, which originated in Jamaica, has long advocated for the decriminalization of marijuana. The new law will also allow tourists to apply for permits to buy small amounts of Jamaican \"ganja\" for medical purposes.\n\nHowever, the law does not mean that Jamaica is abandoning its stance on international drug trafficking. National Security Minister Peter Bunting emphasized that the law will not create a \"free-for-all\" in the cultivation and export of marijuana, and that the country will continue to enforce its international treaty obligations.\n\nJamaica's move follows a trend of relaxation of marijuana laws in other countries. In the United States, several states have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use, including Alaska, which became the third state to legalize recreational marijuana for adults on Tuesday. Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile have also relaxed their marijuana laws in recent years.\n\nThe Jamaican government hopes that the new law will create a new industry for the country, including the production of marijuana-derived products, such as \"Canasol,\" which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients. The law also aims to promote health tourism and the development of a medical marijuana industry.\n\nHowever, the US has expressed concerns about Jamaica's new law, with William Brownfield, the US assistant secretary for counter-narcotics, stating that Jamaica must uphold its international treaty obligations to combat and dismantle drug trafficking organizations.\n\nOverall, Jamaica's new law is a significant step towards decriminalizing marijuana and promoting a new industry for the country.", "answers": ["Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself.

Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The researchers used data from birds and other reptiles to determine that dinosaurs may have used a unique form of sound production, known as closed-mouth vocalization, to communicate with each other.\n\nThe study found that closed-mouth vocalizations are used by birds and other animals to convey messages, particularly during mating or territorial displays.

They found that this behavior is more common in large-bodied birds, such as ostriches and doves, and that it has evolved independently in different species.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

This achievement marks a significant step towards decoding the brain's internal workings, including dreams, memories, and even intentions.\n\nThe study involved researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, who watched YouTube videos while inside an MRI machine. The brain activity was recorded and used to build a model that matched visual patterns with brain activity.

In a letter written to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, Kalashnikov expressed his deep spiritual pain and guilt over the countless lives lost due to his invention. The letter, dated May 2012, was published by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, and reveals a man grappling with the moral implications of his creation.\n\nKalashnikov designed the AK-47 in 1947, inspired by his experiences in World War II, where he was wounded fighting for the Red Army. The rifle's simplicity, reliability, and affordability made it a favorite among soldiers and insurgents alike, with over 100 million units sold worldwide. However, its widespread use has also led to countless deaths, including those of civilians and child soldiers.\n\nIn his letter, Kalashnikov questioned whether he was responsible for the lives lost, despite his intention to design the rifle to defend his country. He wrote, \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" The letter is signed with a wavering hand, suggesting that Kalashnikov may have had help from a priest in composing it.\n\nKalashnikov's conversion to Christianity at the age of 91, and his baptism, may have contributed to his growing sense of guilt. His daughter, Yelena, noted that her father's generation was not strictly observant of Christian teachings. The Russian Orthodox Church, which has sought to consolidate its influence in Russia, responded to Kalashnikov's letter with a statement supporting the use of weapons to protect the Fatherland.\n\nKalashnikov's legacy is complex, reflecting both his pride in his invention and his sorrow over its misuse. His funeral was attended by President Vladimir Putin, and he was honored with numerous Russian state awards, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour.

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. This increased resistance allows the bacteria to repel common forms of immune responses, making it more difficult to treat. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be inherited.\n\nIn lab studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be more aggressive and better at invading human cells. In fact, the smoke-exposed MRSA was able to kill more mice in lab cultures than those that had not been exposed to smoke. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, stated that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances its survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke functions like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. This is a concerning finding, as cigarette smokers are already known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. The study's results add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.\n\nIn a related study, researchers found that e-cigarette vapor also makes MRSA more resistant, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases.\n\nOverall, the findings of these studies highlight the need for further research into the effects of cigarette smoke on the growth and spread of superbugs.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning about the condition, which affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause severe symptoms such as pain in the arms and legs, difficulty breathing, and paralysis.\n\n**What is AFM?**\n\nAFM is a rare condition that can be caused by various germs, including enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. The exact trigger for AFM is often elusive, and there is no specific treatment.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nSymptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The condition is diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and laboratory tests. In some cases, patients may require hospitalization and ventilator support.\n\n**Outbreaks and Cases**\n\nThe CDC reported 88 cases of AFM in 32 states between August 1 and November 13, 2014, with a median age of 7.6 years. The majority of patients were previously healthy, and most reported a respiratory or febrile illness before neurologic symptom onset. Among 80 patients from whom cerebrospinal fluid was obtained, 68 (85%) showed a moderate pleocytosis and normal or mildly elevated protein.\n\n**Investigation and Prevention**\n\nThe CDC is collaborating with partners nationally to investigate reported cases, risk factors, and possible etiologies of this condition. While the specific causes of AFM are still under investigation, being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent a number of severe diseases, including poliomyelitis. Prevention of viral infections includes general hygienic measures, such as frequent hand washing with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick persons, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.\n\n**Personal Stories**\n\nSeveral families have shared their personal stories of dealing with AFM.

Not much is known about the polio-like disease that plagues mostly children, including what causes it. What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing.

Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to examine the bloodstains on the shroud.\n\nResearchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth, which bears an image of a crucified man. They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The study concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the Shroud of Turin is likely a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the crucifixion. The researchers noted that if it were a death shroud of a bleeding, executed person, hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, the bloodstains should be more consistent. The study's conclusions are based on the analysis of the bloodstain patterns, and do not take into account other factors that may have affected the bloodstains, such as the body being cleaned or prepared for burial.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin has been the subject of much debate and study over the years, with some regarding it as a genuine relic and others as a medieval forgery.

He compared the severity of behaviors such as rape and child molestation to those of lesser severity, such as unwanted touching or comments.\n\nActress Alyssa Milano, a vocal advocate for the #MeToo movement, took to Twitter to call out Damon's comments, stating that the \"micro\" behaviors he referred to are what make the \"macro\" behaviors possible.

The charity has been working in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, with significant success. In Moldova, there has been a 70% reduction in the number of children in institutions since 2007, while in the Czech Republic, a 75% fall in admissions has been achieved in a demonstration area. In Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has decreased by 54%, with a 34% drop in new admissions and a 440% increase in foster carers.\n\nThe practice of institutionalizing children is a global issue, with an estimated 8 million children worldwide being separated from their families. This is often due to poverty, lack of education and health facilities, and discrimination. The effects of institutionalization are severe, with children being more likely to experience malnutrition, abuse, and trafficking. They are also more likely to suffer from developmental delays, stunting, and psychological trauma.\n\nJK Rowling, founder and president of Lumos, attributes her own instinctive reaction to a disturbing photograph of a child in a caged bed as the catalyst for her work with the charity. She emphasizes that the solution to this problem is not to improve conditions in institutions, but to eradicate them altogether. This can be achieved by investing in inclusive education and health, supporting vulnerable families, and promoting family-based care alternatives.\n\nInternational donors play a crucial role in this effort, and their support can make a significant difference. The charity is calling on people to join the #Letstalklumos campaign to raise awareness and create a global movement to end the practice of institutionalizing children. With the support of donors and the public, it is possible to achieve a world where children are raised within their families and communities, rather than in institutions.\n\nThe economic benefits of ending institutionalization are also significant, as it is more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution. Lumos estimates that with continued investment and support, the practice of institutionalizing children can be eradicated globally by 2050, making it a solvable problem in our lifetime.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The discovery was announced in a study published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nCaihong juji, meaning \"rainbow with a big crest\" in Mandarin, is a crow-sized, bird-like dinosaur with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds. The dinosaur's feathers were found to be iridescent, with microscopic structures called melanosomes that were responsible for pigmentation. The melanosomes were detected using powerful microscopes and were found to be pancake-shaped, similar to those of hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji suggests a more colorful Jurassic world than previously imagined, with the dinosaur's plumage likely used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The dinosaur's body was covered in feathers, with long, linear feathers on its neck and short, sinuous feathers on its head and chest. The tail feathers were particularly striking, with large, pennaceous feathers that formed a frond-shaped tail.\n\nThe study also found that Caihong juji had a unique combination of bird-like and reptilian characteristics, with a bird-like body and a reptilian skull. The dinosaur's forelimbs were proportionally short, but its hindlimbs were highly elongated, suggesting that it may have glided from tree to tree.\n\nThe researchers were able to determine the original colors of Caihong juji's feathers by analyzing the melanosomes found in the fossil. They found that the dinosaur's head, chest, and parts of its tail had melanosomes that were long, flat, and organized into sheets, similar to those found in the iridescent throat feathers of hummingbirds. While they couldn't reconstruct the exact colors of the dinosaur's feathers, they suspect that they may have had a rainbow glimmer.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji is significant not only because of its colorful feathers but also because it is the oldest known animal to have asymmetrical feathers, a key adaptation for flight. The dinosaur's frond-like tail had short, stiff leading edges that would have borne the aerodynamic load of flight, making it a crucial find for understanding the evolution of flight in birds.\n\nThe study's lead author, Xing Xu, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that he was shocked", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

This has led to a loss of revenue for the city, with some businesses even considering layoffs.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for being regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families. Seattle residents are taking advantage of the tax-free options outside the city, with some driving to neighboring suburbs to avoid the tax. The tax has also been criticized for not applying to sugar-heavy beverages sold at Starbucks, which has rejected the tax.\n\nCook County, Illinois, repealed its own sugary drink tax in December 2018, after just two months, due to a public outcry and significant losses in sales. The tax had a similar effect in Philadelphia, where sales declined and customers shopped outside the city limits.\n\nA bill to bring the tax statewide in Washington has been re-introduced, but local businesses are concerned about the impact on their sales and profits. Some residents support the tax, citing its potential to discourage sugary drink consumption and promote public health.\n\nCritics argue that the tax is a form of \"nanny statism\" and that the city should focus on providing education and incentives rather than imposing taxes. The tax has also been criticized for being poorly implemented, with some arguing that it should be applied consistently to all sugary drinks, including those sold at Starbucks.\n\nOverall, the Seattle sugary drink tax has been a failure, driving sales outside the city and depriving the city of revenue.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

However, a closer examination of the data reveals that many of these cases are not as straightforward as they seem.\n\nAccording to the North Coast Journal, the high rate of missing persons reports in Humboldt County can be attributed to several factors, including the county's liberal standards for filing a missing persons report, which allows for reports to be filed without a waiting period or jurisdictional restrictions. Additionally, the county's remote location and high number of cannabis farms have led to a large number of individuals going missing, often for extended periods of time, without any foul play.\n\nMany of the missing individuals are adults who have gone to work on marijuana farms or have been involved in the cannabis industry, which can make it difficult for law enforcement to investigate their disappearance. In some cases, individuals may be out of communication with their families for weeks or months, leading to reports of missing persons.\n\nHowever, not all missing persons cases in Humboldt County are related to the cannabis industry. The county also has a high rate of missing children, with an average of 490 missing children reports annually for every 100,000 residents, compared to the state average of 280. While some of these cases are runaways, others are more complex and may involve foul play.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and the Eureka Police Department have emphasized that many missing persons cases are resolved within days or weeks, and that the majority of reports are for individuals who have been located and cleared from the system. However, some cases remain unsolved, and families of missing individuals often find the process of searching for their loved ones to be frustrating.\n\nOne such case is that of Jeff Joseph, a dispensary owner who disappeared in 2014 while visiting his farm near Weitchpec. His sister, Vikki Joseph, has been working to keep his case in the public eye and has been in contact with investigators, but she feels that the sheriff's office has not been proactive in pursuing the case.\n\nThe National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) has also been involved in investigating missing persons cases in Humboldt County, but the patchwork of information available through local and state organizations can make it difficult to get a complete picture of the issue.\n\nIn recent developments, the Humboldt County Sheriff's", "answers": ["It turns out missing people are pretty easy to find when they appear every week in your living room.

Myrna Arias, who worked for Intermex from February to May 2014, claims that her boss, John Stubits, required her to download the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone, which tracked her every move, including her driving speed and routes taken.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours, likening it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet. Stubits allegedly admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged about knowing her driving speed at specific moments. When Arias uninstalled the app to protect her privacy, Stubits scolded her and told her she had to keep her phone on 24/7 to assist clients.\n\nArias claims that she was fired a few weeks later, and that her employer's actions were a clear invasion of her privacy.

Here are five notable examples:\n\n1. **Anthony Scaramucci**: The former White House Communications Director's tenure was the shortest in history, lasting only 11 days. Scaramucci's tumultuous time in the Trump administration was marked by protocol breaches, conflicting statements, and a profanity-laced interview. His wife even filed for divorce during his brief stint.\n\n2. **Chris Christie**: The former Governor of New Jersey and 2016 presidential contender has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the state's history. His reputation was damaged by the Bridgegate scandal, and his attempts to curry favor with Donald Trump ultimately fell flat. Christie's recent actions, such as lounging on a state-owned beach during a government shutdown, have only added to his unpopularity.\n\n3. **James Comey**: The former FBI Director was a polarizing figure during the 2016 presidential election, with some attributing Trump's victory to his investigation of Hillary Clinton. Comey's firing by Trump in 2017 was met with conflicting justifications from the White House, further muddying his reputation.\n\n4. **Mark Fields**: The former CEO of Ford Motor Company was let go in 2017 after failing to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Despite investing in electric and autonomous vehicle technology, Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure, and his attempts to woo shareholders ultimately fell short.\n\n5. **Tiger Woods**: The golf superstar has been embroiled in controversy since reports of his infidelity surfaced in 2009. His latest scandal involved a DUI arrest, which revealed a combination of prescription medications in his system. Woods has not won a major tournament since and is currently ranked 899, his lowest ranking ever.\n\nThese individuals, once held in high esteem, have fallen from their pedestals due to a combination of factors, including controversy, scandal, and poor decision-making.

President Barack Obama has also threatened to veto any bill that includes these provisions.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a hardline stance on the ACA, but he is also aware that a shutdown could have significant consequences for the country. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has taken a tough stance, refusing to negotiate with the House on a short-term funding bill and warning that a shutdown would be devastating to the Republican Party.\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, could lose an estimated $200 million a day and see over 700,000 jobs affected if the government shuts down.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

According to reports, Neiman Marcus's computer network was penetrated by hackers as far back as July, with the breach not being fully contained until January 1. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, stating that some customers' payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at their stores. Neiman Marcus has apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner, citing a need to confirm evidence before making a public announcement.\n\nIn a similar incident, Target Corp. suffered a massive data breach that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts, as well as the personal information of 70 million people. A 17-page report from computer firm iSight provides new insight into the hack, revealing that the malware used was a type of software that was placed in the store's point-of-sale systems. The report notes that the operational sophistication of the breach was high, with the hackers displaying innovation and skill in orchestrating the various components of the activity.\n\nThe report also suggests that the malware was likely created in regions with strong software capabilities, such as Eastern Europe and Brazil. The tactic used by the hackers was new to eCrime, and involved covertly subverting network controls and common forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers. The report concludes that this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for cyber crooks with little risk, and that cardholders can expect more of this type of breach in the future.\n\nA joint investigation by state attorneys general is currently underway to examine whether the two attacks are related, with both appearing to have been committed by criminal groups in Eastern Europe.

Mohawk, a beloved and well-known lion in Kenya, had escaped from Nairobi National Park and was surrounded by hundreds of bystanders, who were taking selfies and throwing rocks at the animal. The rangers, who had initially planned to tranquilize the lion, were forced to shoot it after it became agitated and attacked the man.\n\nThe incident sparked an outcry among Kenyans, with many questioning why the rangers did not use tranquilizers instead of lethal force.

In the past two months, several lions have escaped from Nairobi National Park, with some being recaptured alive. The park, which is home to endangered black rhinos, lions, leopards, and other animals, is under growing pressure due to the expansion of the city and the construction of a highway through a section of the park.\n\nIn a separate incident in South Africa, a lion named Sylvester escaped from Karoo National Park and was being hunted by wildlife officials. While the officials initially planned to kill the lion, they later reconsidered and are now considering various options, including relocating the lion to another park or donating it to a conservation group.\n\nThe incidents highlight the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflict with livestock herders. The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the African lion a \"vulnerable\" species, with its population having declined by 50% in the past 20 years.\n\nThe reasons behind the surge in lion escapes in Kenya are unclear, but conservationists point to habitat loss as the central reason.

The data brokers, which include companies like Acxiom, Experian, and Equifax, collect and sell consumer information to marketers, who use it to target shoppers based on their income, clothing size, and other personal characteristics.\n\nThe report found that some data brokers are selling lists of consumers with specific health conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, and depression, along with their medication information. Others are selling lists of people with addictive behaviors towards drugs and alcohol, as well as lists of police officers' home addresses, which could put their lives in danger.

It is estimated to be 5-10 times the mass of Earth and has a highly elliptical orbit that takes 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine was made by a team of researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006. Brown and his colleague, Konstantin Batygin, used mathematical and computer modeling to infer the existence of the planet, which they believe is responsible for the unusual motion of small, icy bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system.\n\nThe researchers have not directly observed the planet, but they are confident that it exists based on the gravitational influence it has on the smaller objects. They estimate that the planet is about two to four times the diameter of Earth and is likely an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Mike Brown argues that Pluto's demotion was necessary for the good of science and that it is now an interesting member of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.\n\nBrown has stated that he has no regrets about his role in Pluto's demotion and believes that the controversy will eventually die down. He hopes that the New Horizons mission to Pluto will help to shift the focus away from the debate over Pluto's status and towards the study of the Kuiper Belt.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on at least two continents searching for the object.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over a period of five years, found that those who experienced the largest fluctuations in body weight had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased. This can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding yo-yo dieting. \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off,\" he said. \"This data can be used as motivation to keep the weight off.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. Researchers have found that people with coronary heart disease who experienced large fluctuations in weight over a period of 4.7 years were at a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death compared to those who experienced little change in body weight.\n\nThe study's results suggest that weight fluctuations may be a concern for people with coronary heart disease, and that maintaining a stable weight may be crucial for preventing heart-related complications. However, the study's authors note that the analysis was observational and cannot prove cause-and-effect between yo-yo dieting and increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding yo-yo dieting to reduce the risk of heart-related complications in people with coronary artery disease.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another.

The issue occurred when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The valve, which regulates the flow of ammonia coolant, reached a pre-set temperature limit, causing the shutdown.\n\nAccording to NASA, the crew was never in any danger, and the situation is not considered a life-threatening emergency. However, the problem has forced the crew to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems have been shut down in the Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab.\n\nEngineers are trying to determine whether a software fix can resolve the issue or if a spacewalk is necessary. The decision on whether to perform a spacewalk may take a couple of days to a couple of weeks.

The space station is scheduled to be maintained through 2020, with the possibility of extending its operating life.\n\nThe external cooling loops are critical systems that circulate ammonia outside the station to keep equipment cool.

On August 28, 2005, Ricks issued a dire weather forecast that would go down in history as one of the most urgent and effective warnings ever issued by the NWS.\n\nRicks, who was the forecast coordinator for the Slidell, Louisiana, office, knew he had to convey the gravity of the situation to the public. He spent hours writing a special bulletin, which was titled \"URGENT...

PERHAPS LONGER\" and that \"WATER SHORTAGES WILL MAKE HUMAN SUFFERING INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS.\"\n\nRicks' warning was not just a prediction, but a personal plea to the public to take action. He had lived through two previous hurricanes, Betsy and Camille, and knew the devastation they had caused. He wanted to ensure that the public understood the severity of the situation and took necessary precautions to evacuate.\n\nThe response to Ricks' warning was overwhelming, with many people evacuating the area and seeking shelter at the Superdome. However, the storm still caused catastrophic damage, with widespread flooding, roof and wall failures, and the loss of thousands of lives.\n\nRicks' warning was not an isolated incident. In recent years, the NWS has made a concerted effort to increase the effectiveness of its weather forecasts during emergency situations. Meteorologist Gary Szatkowski's \"personal plea\" during Hurricane Sandy's landfall in 2012, which included gut-wrenching statements about the potential consequences of not evacuating, is another example of this effort.\n\nRicks' warning has been recognized as one of the most effective in NWS history, and his bravery and dedication to his work have earned him hero status. His story serves as a reminder of the importance of accurate and timely weather forecasting and the impact it can have on saving lives.\n\nIn a recent interview, Ricks reflected on the aftermath of the storm, saying, \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one.

{"pred": "**Rising Colorectal Cancer Rates Among Younger Adults: A Growing Concern**\n\nA recent study has shed light on a concerning trend in the United States: colorectal cancer rates are increasing among younger adults, with one in seven cases diagnosed in individuals under the age of 50. This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults.\n\nAccording to the study, which analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011, nearly 15% of patients were under 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment. In fact, patients under 50 had a 95% five-year survival rate for localized tumors, compared to 92% for older patients.\n\nResearchers believe that younger patients are often diagnosed at a later stage because they may not exhibit symptoms until the cancer has spread. Dr. Samantha Hendren, lead author of the study, emphasizes the importance of being aware of warning signs such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or a blockage in the colon. She also notes that people with a family history of colon cancer or other risk factors should begin screening earlier than age 50.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate about whether screening guidelines should be altered to reflect the changing demographics of colorectal cancer. While some experts argue that starting screening at a younger age could help prevent more cancer deaths, others caution that the risk is still low and that expanding screening to younger age groups could be costly and unnecessary.\n\nDr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, suggests that environmental factors such as smoking, obesity, and poor diet may be contributing to the increase in colon cancer among younger adults. He notes that patients with multiple risk factors should be considered for earlier screening.\n\nAs the incidence of colorectal cancer continues to rise among younger adults, the medical community is urging increased awareness and vigilance. Dr. Hendren emphasizes the need for long-term support for young colorectal cancer survivors, who may face physical and psychological challenges as a result of their disease and treatment.\n\nUltimately, the study highlights the importance of early detection and prevention in reducing the burden of colorectal cancer. As researchers continue to explore the causes and consequences of this trend, it is clear that a proactive approach to screening and treatment will be crucial in addressing this growing public health concern.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, has revealed a treasure trove of artefacts and bones, including the earliest known evidence of human interaction with megafauna. The discovery pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by 10,000 years, challenging previous assumptions about the ingenuity and adaptability of Indigenous Australians.\n\n**The Discovery**\n\nThe site was discovered by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard while surveying the area. The rock shelter, located about 550 kilometers north of Adelaide, contains a blackened roof, indicating human activity, and a spring surrounded by rock art. Excavations have yielded over 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile.\n\n**Significance of the Find**\n\nThe discovery is significant for several reasons:\n\n1. **Age**: The site dates back 49,000 years, making it one of the oldest known human settlements in Australia.\n2. **Geographic location**: The site is located in the arid interior of Australia, which was previously thought to be uninhabitable by humans.\n3. **Technological advancements**: The site contains evidence of early technologies, including stone axes, ochre, and bone needles, which were developed locally.\n4. **Human-megafauna interaction**: The site provides the first reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum, a giant wombat-like species.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of human history in Australia:\n\n1. **Indigenous Australians**: The discovery challenges the Eurocentric view that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as other populations.\n2. **Human migration**: The site suggests that humans migrated south from the northern part of the continent to the southern interior much earlier than previously thought.\n3. **Megafauna extinction**: The discovery of human-megafauna interaction raises questions about the role of humans in the extinction of megafauna.\n\n**Future Research**\n\nThe discovery of the Warratyi rock shelter is a significant milestone in the study of human history in Australia.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "**Harnessing the Power of the Universe: A Quest for Energy and Alien Life**\n\nA recent paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper has revived the concept of harnessing energy from distant stars, a notion first proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. According to Kardashev's model, there are three levels of technologically advanced civilizations: Level I, which harnesses all a planet's resources; Level II, which harnesses all a star's radiation; and Level III, which harnesses all a galaxy's resources. Hooper's paper suggests that advanced civilizations would need to capture stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe.\n\nThe universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, causing stars beyond our Local Group of galaxies to fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making them unobservable and inaccessible. To prevent this, advanced civilizations would need to capture and harvest stars from other galaxies, a process that would require significant energy and resources. Hooper proposes using a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to collect energy from a star and beam it back to a nearby planet.\n\nThis concept is not new, as science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described similar structures in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\" and physicist Freeman Dyson proposed similar structures in a scientific paper in 1960. Dyson realized that advanced civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation. He proposed that really advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems, perhaps dismantling planets to form a shell of satellites around their star to capture its energy.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres has been explored in science fiction, including in Larry Niven's novel \"Ringworld\" and the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\" While humans are still far from achieving Level III of Kardashev's scale, the possibility of advanced civilizations harnessing energy from distant stars raises the question of whether we might be able to detect their presence. Hooper suggests that astronomers could look for unusual galaxies with their prime stars ripped away, or for the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their stars harvested by an advanced civilization.\n\nWhile we may not have the technology to detect these signatures yet, the idea of harnessing the power of the universe and searching for alien life remains an exciting and intriguing area of research.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

{"pred": "Recent archaeological discoveries in East Africa have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have uncovered evidence of a significant shift in toolmaking and trading networks among early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This period marks the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, a time of great change and innovation in human history.\n\nThe discoveries, published in three papers in the journal Science, suggest that early humans in the region were responding to dramatic shifts in the climate, which led to unpredictable food sources and the need for greater mobility and resourcefulness. The researchers propose that this led to the development of smaller, more specialized tools, such as spearpoints and blades, which were made from obsidian and other exotic materials brought from distant locations.\n\nThe use of obsidian, a volcanic glass, is particularly significant, as it indicates a level of technological sophistication and the ability to transport and process raw materials over long distances. The team also found evidence of the extraction of pigments, including red and black rocks, which were likely used for symbolic purposes, such as painting or decorating tools.\n\nThese findings challenge the long-held view that modern human behaviors, such as symbolism, innovation, and art, emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago, and instead suggest that these traits were present much earlier, around 300,000 years ago. This challenges the idea of a single \"human revolution\" that led to modernity, and instead suggests a more gradual process of complex change.\n\nThe discoveries also highlight the importance of social networks and exchange between different groups of early humans, which allowed for the sharing of knowledge, resources, and technologies. This is seen in the use of obsidian and other exotic materials, as well as the presence of pigment and other symbolic markers.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior. They suggest that early humans were capable of complex thought and innovation, and that these traits were present in multiple species of hominins, not just modern humans. The discoveries also highlight the importance of climate change and environmental factors in driving human evolution and innovation.\n\nOverall, the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide a new perspective on the evolution of human behavior and technology, and challenge our current understanding of the \"human revolution\" that led to modernity.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

In September 2011, federal marshals raided Gibson's facilities in Tennessee, seizing wood and shutting down production. The raids were the second of their kind, following a similar incident in 2009.\n\nThe Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, despite being aware of the risks involved. Gibson, however, denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe controversy has sparked debate in the music industry, with some, like Chris Martin of C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the Lacey Act as a necessary measure to prevent illegal logging. Others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature, which may require guitar builders to prove the provenance of wood acquired decades ago.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also had a significant impact on the trade in vintage instruments, with dealers like Nashville's George Gruhn facing challenges in navigating the law's complexities. The EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the law, stating that its intent is to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that responsible sourcing is essential.\n\nMeanwhile, the Internet Archive has been collecting data from Alexa Internet since 1996, adding it to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.

She pushed the raccoon's head underwater, holding it there for what felt like a long time as it continued to bite and claw at her arms.\n\nThe raccoon was later confirmed to have tested positive for rabies by the Maine Center for Disease Control. This incident is not an isolated case, as there have been 20 animals, including raccoons, red foxes, and skunks, that have tested positive for rabies in Maine as of June 7.

The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was approximately a mile deep in some areas and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding, published by NASA scientists, challenges the previous understanding of Mars as a planet with only occasional and rare flowing water.\n\nThe research team used infrared telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere and analyze the isotopic composition of water molecules. They found that the water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, indicating that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past. By calculating the concentration of deuterium, the scientists estimated that the ancient ocean would have been at least 137 meters deep if it had covered the entire planet.\n\nThe study suggests that the ocean persisted for millions of years, but eventually receded and froze as the Martian atmosphere thinned and the planet lost its insulation. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up in the Martian polar caps.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the Red Planet. The presence of water, a crucial ingredient for life, increases the chances of finding evidence of past or present life on Mars. The European Space Agency's ExoMars rover, set to launch in 2018, will search for chemical signatures of life in the Martian soil.\n\nOther studies have also supported the idea of a wet and habitable Mars. Astronomers have analyzed the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere and found that the planet's ordinary hydrogen has been leaking into space over time, leaving behind a higher proportion of deuterium. This suggests that Mars once had a significant amount of water, which would have covered the planet to a depth of around 137 meters if it had been evenly distributed.\n\nWhile the exact amount of water on ancient Mars is still a topic of debate, the evidence continues to mount that the planet was once a warm and wet world, with a chemical environment that was hospitable to biology. The search for life on Mars is ongoing, and the discovery of an ancient ocean has brought us one step closer to understanding the Red Planet's history and potential for life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The film, starring Will Smith and Margot Robbie, is a caper about a veteran con man and his young apprentice. The movie's plot is described as ridiculous and absurd, with a lack of truth and no real revelation of the secret underworld it claims to expose. However, the film's charm lies in its audacity and the performances of its leads.\n\nThe casting of the film was a highly publicized process, with several A-list actors considered for the lead roles. Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck were all considered for the role of the con man, while Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, and Kristen Stewart were among those considered for the female lead. Ultimately, Will Smith and Margot Robbie were cast in the roles, with Smith bringing his signature charm and charisma to the part.\n\nThe film's directors, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, aimed to create a movie that captures the effortless allure of a classic Hitchcock film. They succeeded in bringing out the best in Smith, who is able to play the role of a con man with ease and charm. Margot Robbie also shines in the film, bringing a modern take on the classic \"damsel in distress\" trope.\n\nThe film's success can be attributed to its ability to balance humor and drama, with a lighthearted tone that makes it enjoyable to watch.

The case revolves around the shape of the Kit Kat finger wafer, which Nestlé has been fighting to trademark in the European Union (EU) for over a decade.\n\nThe ECJ ruling sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) to review a 2012 decision that upheld Nestlé's trademark on the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit. Mondelez, the owner of Cadbury, had objected to the trademark, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be protected.\n\nThe ECJ found that Nestlé failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive, but also dismissed Mondelez's appeal against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016. This leaves open the possibility that the EUIPO could still preserve protection for Kit Kat's shape, taking into account new evidence that the shape is distinctive to people in more countries.\n\nThe trademark dispute has significant implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The case has also been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has featured in Britain's Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat.\n\nThe dispute has been ongoing since 2002, when Nestlé applied for a trademark in Europe for the Kit Kat shape. Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, has been fighting against the trademark, arguing that it is not distinctive enough. The case has seen several appeals and counter-appeals, with the ECJ's ruling sending the case back to the EUIPO for further review.\n\nThe outcome of the case is still uncertain, but it is likely to have significant implications for the chocolate industry and trademark law in the EU. Nestlé has stated that it believes the EU trademark office will side with the company, but Mondelez has welcomed the ECJ's ruling, saying that it is a \"significant victory\" for the company.\n\nIn related news, the case has also highlighted the complexities of trademark law in the EU, with other companies, such as Lindt and Toblerone, also facing trademark disputes over their iconic shapes.

According to researchers, the sounds made by dinosaurs were likely more similar to those of birds, with a low, throaty whoosh of air, often referred to as \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" This type of vocalization is characterized by a low-frequency sound produced by pushing air into an esophageal pouch rather than exhaling through an open beak.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization, which is often used for territorial or courtship displays. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, a physiology professor at Midwestern University, noted that the association between large body size and closed-mouth vocalization is due to physics. The inflation of an elastic cavity, such as the esophageal pouch, requires a certain level of lung pressure, which is more easily achieved in larger body sizes.\n\nThe researchers believe that some dinosaurs, particularly those with large body sizes, may have made closed-mouthed vocalizations, similar to birds today, perhaps during mating displays. However, no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like.\n\nThe study's findings offer a new perspective on the sounds of the ancient world, suggesting that the Jurassic world may have been a more subdued and bird-like place, with dinosaurs making booming, closed-mouth sounds rather than the loud roars often depicted in popular culture.\n\nIn a related article, sound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the original \"Jurassic Park\" film, revealed that he used a variety of animal sounds to create the iconic dinosaur noises, including a baby elephant for the T. rex roar, a tortoise for the velociraptor's mating call, and a goose for the raptor's hiss.

Despite extensive searches, the plane's fate remains unknown. However, statisticians and experts are using Bayesian statistics, a mathematical technique developed by 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, to help locate the plane.\n\n**Bayesian Statistics: A Powerful Tool**\n\nBayesian statistics is a method of analyzing data and making predictions based on probability. It allows experts to update their estimates of the probability of finding the plane in any given location, taking into account new information and evidence. This approach has been used successfully in previous searches, including the location of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009.\n\n**The Air France Flight 447 Search**\n\nIn 2009, Air France Flight 447 disappeared while flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. Despite finding debris, the plane's wreckage was not located until 2011, two years later. Statisticians from Metron Inc. were called in to help locate the plane. Using Bayesian statistics, they analyzed the data and created a probability map of the search area. Although the initial search was unsuccessful, the team was asked to re-analyze the data, and they discovered a new area of highest probability. A subsequent search found the plane's wreckage, which was later determined to have been caused by pilot error.\n\n**The Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Search**\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been ongoing for years, with no signs of the plane. Statisticians from Metron Inc. are not involved in the current search, but they have offered their expertise to the Malaysian government. The search area is vast, and the currents in the Indian Ocean are unpredictable, making it a challenging task. Colleen Keller, a senior analyst at Metron Inc., believes that the plane is likely at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and may never be found.\n\n**The Power of Bayesian Statistics**\n\nBayesian statistics has proven to be a powerful tool in solving complex problems, including the location of missing planes. Its ability to update estimates based on new information and evidence makes it an essential tool in search operations.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

This event is a combination of a Blue Moon, a Supermoon, and a total lunar eclipse, making it a unique and spectacular sight.\n\n**What is a Blue Moon?**\nA Blue Moon occurs when there are two full moons in a single month, which happens approximately every 2.7 years. The second full moon in a month is called a Blue Moon.\n\n**What is a Supermoon?**\nA Supermoon is a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon.\n\n**What is a Total Lunar Eclipse?**\nA total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's light from reaching the moon. This causes the moon to take on a reddish hue, often referred to as a \"blood moon.\"\n\n**When and Where to See the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse**\nThe Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, on January 31, 2018. The eclipse will begin at 11:48am UTC and reach its maximum at 1:30pm UTC.\n\n**How to See the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse**\nThe best time to see the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse is right after moonrise and before sunrise, when the moon is sitting on the horizon. It will appear its biggest and brightest due to a \"moon illusion\" effect. If it's too cloudy or too cold to go outside, you can watch the event live on the Virtual Telescope project's livestream.\n\n**Photographing the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse**\nTo take a picture of the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse, use a smartphone or a DSLR camera. For a smartphone, tap on the moon on the screen and hold your finger in place to lock the camera's focus, then adjust the exposure slider to get the right balance of light. For a DSLR, use the daylight white balance and adjust for the sunlight being reflected off the moon.\n\n**No Special Glasses Needed**\nUnlike solar eclipses, the Super Blue Blood Moon", "answers": ["Look up at the sky on Jan. 31 and you may witness a sight unseen for 150 years.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

According to police, Altahan was driving westbound on Route 4 when her GPS device suddenly directed her to turn around, as she had passed her intended destination. In a swift reaction, Altahan left the road, and her car ended up dangling from the telephone pole's support wire.\n\nFortunately, neither Altahan nor her passenger was injured in the incident. Witnesses, including a person at a nearby miniature golf course, reported seeing the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended from the pole. The Rutland City Fire Department and State Police responded to the scene, with State Police releasing a statement confirming the details of the incident.\n\nThis unusual accident serves as a reminder of the importance of carefully following GPS directions and not reacting impulsively to sudden changes in navigation.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP.

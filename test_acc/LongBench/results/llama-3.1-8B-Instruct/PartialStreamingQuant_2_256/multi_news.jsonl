Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have discovered that cigarette smoke can fuel the growth of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This alarming finding suggests that cigarette smoke not only harms the smoker's respiratory and immune systems but also makes the bacteria more aggressive and harder to kill.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, cigarette smoke can stress MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls and become more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is not limited to the smoke-exposed bacteria; it can also be inherited by subsequent generations of bacteria. The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to the immune system's killing mechanisms than non-exposed MRSA.\n\nThe study also compared the effects of cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor on MRSA. While e-cigarette vapor had a similar effect, it was less potent than cigarette smoke. The study found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, making it more difficult to kill. Furthermore, the smoke-exposed MRSA was more adept at adhering to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to invade and cause infection.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke may be an additional contributing factor to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases.

The illness, which affects the nervous system, has been linked to a polio-like paralysis, leaving many children and adults with long-term disabilities.\n\n**Confirmed Cases and Outbreaks**\n\nAs of July 2022, there have been 32 new cases of AFM confirmed across the United States, with 17 states reporting cases. The number of cases has been steadily increasing since April, with a peak in August. In 2014, 120 cases were reported between August and December, with 85% of children requiring ventilators and 85% of patients showing some improvement, but only 3% fully recovering.\n\n**What is AFM?**\n\nAFM is a rare condition that affects the spinal cord, causing muscle weakness, paralysis, and respiratory failure. The cause is unknown, but it has been linked to enteroviruses, including the West Nile virus. Symptoms include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing, and slurred speech. The best prevention is good hygiene, including hand washing, staying up-to-date on vaccinations, and avoiding close contact with sick people.\n\n**Investigations and Research**\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been investigating the cause of AFM, but no specific cause has been identified. Researchers are working on developing a vaccine to prevent the condition.

The guitar is now valued at a significant amount, potentially exceeding $1 million.\n\nThe couple's marriage has been marred by disagreements, with Frances Bean seeking to have the guitar returned to her. However, the situation has taken a turn for the worse, with Isaiah requesting spousal support from Frances Bean, claiming she promised to cover his expenses during their marriage. He is seeking $25,000 per month in spousal support, citing that he left his job to support his family and Frances promised to cover his expenses.\n\nIsaiah claims that Frances promised to pay for his child's private school and housing, but she has since reneged on these commitments. He also claims that he deserves a share of the money earned from business deals made during their marriage, as there is no prenuptial agreement in place. Frances Bean, however, has stated that the guitar is a family heirloom and not his to take, and that she is willing to pay some spousal support but not the amount he is requesting.\n\nThe situation has escalated to the point where a judge has ordered Frances Bean to pay $15,000 per month in spousal support, but the matter is still in court.

The fossil is exceptionally well-preserved, with the dinosaur's feathers and bones still intact.\n\nThe Caihong juji is a small, two-legged carnivorous dinosaur that weighed about a pound. The dinosaur had a unique combination of features, including a crested head, a bird-like body, and a frond-like tail. The dinosaur's body was covered in iridescent feathers, which were likely used for display or social status, similar to modern birds. The researchers used a technique called discriminant function analysis to determine the color of the dinosaur's feathers, which suggested that the feathers were iridescent, with a rainbow-like color.\n\nThe researchers believe that the dinosaur's feathers were used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or showing off to other dinosaurs. The Caihong juji's frond-like tail feathers were asymmetrical, with the leading edge of the feather being wider than the trailing edge.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

{"pred": "Seattle's sugary drink tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to the price of sugary beverages, has been met with widespread criticism and resistance from residents, businesses, and retailers. The tax was implemented in January 2018, with the goal of reducing sugar consumption and raising revenue for public health initiatives. However, the tax has been deemed regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families and driving sales to neighboring cities and counties.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed in December 2018 after a public outcry and a significant decline in sales. The tax added a penny per ounce to sugary drinks, but was later repealed due to its unpopularity. The tax was seen as a burden on low-income families and small businesses.\n\nIn Seattle, the tax has led to a significant increase in prices, with a case of Gatorade going from $15.99 to $26.33. Retailers like Costco have taken steps to inform customers of the tax, posting signs directing them to nearby locations outside the city where they can buy the same products without the tax. The tax has also led to a decline in sales for retailers, with some seeing a 34% decline in sales of sugary drinks.\n\nThe tax has been criticized for its lack of consistency, as it does not apply to sugary drinks that contain milk, such as those sold at Starbucks. The tax has also been seen as a regressive tax, disproportionately affecting low-income families. Some argue that the tax is a form of \"taxation without representation,\" as shoppers are being driven to neighboring cities to buy their groceries.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of effectiveness in reducing sugary drink consumption. A study found that people are still drinking soda, but buying it outside the city. The tax has also led to a decline in revenue for the city, as shoppers are opting to buy their groceries in neighboring cities.\n\nIn Spokane, Washington, a similar tax is being considered, but has been met with resistance from local businesses. The tax would add 1.75 cents per ounce to the price of sugary drinks. Some residents are concerned that the tax would lead to a decline in business for local retailers.\n\nIn contrast, some residents in Spokane support the tax, citing the health benefits of reducing sugary drink consumption.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Arias, a sales executive for Intermex, was required to use the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone to track her movements during work hours. However, she objected to the app's GPS function being used to monitor her location outside of work hours, likening it to an \"invasion of her privacy.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias' boss, John Stubits, admitted that employees would be monitored while off-duty and even bragged about knowing her driving speed and routes. Arias expressed her concerns to Stubits, who told her that she should tolerate the intrusion as she was being paid more than her previous employer, NetSpend. Despite her objections, Arias was fired after uninstalling the app to protect her privacy.\n\nArias claims that she was a high-performing employee, meeting all her quotas and earning $7,250 per month. However, her termination has made it difficult for her to find a new job, and she is seeking damages in excess of $500,000.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges invasion of privacy, retaliation, and unfair business practices, among other claims. Arias' attorney, Gail Glick, stated that the app's GPS function was always on, even when the phone was turned off, and that employees were not informed about the app's capabilities. Glick also noted that the company's actions were a clear violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy.\n\nArias' case highlights the issue of employee monitoring and the fine line between legitimate business interests and employee privacy rights.

These individuals, including a former White House Communications Director, a governor, a Director of the FBI, a CEO, and a professional golfer, have all faced public scrutiny and controversy that led to their downfall.\n\n**1. Anthony Scaramucci**\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the former White House Communications Director, was fired in July 2017, just 10 days after his appointment. His tenure was marked by protocol breaches, conflicts with other officials, and a profanity-laced interview that damaged his reputation. His wife's divorce filing and his own lack of experience in the field also contributed to his downfall.\n\n**2. Chris Christie**\n\nGovernor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, has seen his reputation plummet due to his association with the Bridgegate scandal, where a traffic jam was created on the George Washington Bridge in 2013. His attempt to gain a cabinet position in the Trump administration was unsuccessful, and his reputation was further tarnished by his involvement in the scandal. His low approval ratings and the scandal surrounding the George Washington Bridge incident have made him a less influential figure.\n\n**3. James Comey**\n\nJames Comey, the former Director of the FBI, was fired by President Trump in May 2017. His decision to publicly criticize Hillary Clinton's email use and his handling of the investigation into her email server led to controversy. His firing was met with conflicting justifications from the White House, further damaging his reputation.\n\n**4. Mark Fields**\n\nMark Fields, the former CEO of Ford Motor Company, was let go in May 2017 after failing to inspire confidence in investors. His tenure was marked by a 40% decline in Ford's stock price and a 5% increase in corporate revenue. His decision to invest in electric and autonomous vehicle technology was met with skepticism, leading to his eventual departure.\n\n**5. Tiger Woods**\n\nTiger Woods, a professional golfer, has seen his reputation decline significantly since 2009.

The standoff has been brewing for weeks, with the House and Senate at odds over the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\n**House Republicans' Plan**\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has proposed a spending bill that includes a one-year delay of the health care law and a repeal of the tax on medical devices. However, Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), have vowed to reject any bill that includes changes to the health care law. The Senate is expected to quickly pass a bill to fund the government without the anti-Obamacare provisions, which would then be sent back to the House.\n\n**Senate Democrats' Strategy**\n\nSenate Democrats, led by Reid, are taking a hardline stance against any concessions on the health care law. They believe that the House Republicans will eventually cave in to their demands to pass a clean spending bill, which would keep the government funded without any anti-Obamacare provisions. This strategy is based on the assumption that the House Republicans will suffer the most from the shutdown, as they are the ones who have been pushing for a confrontation with the Democrats.\n\n**Economic Impact**\n\nThe Washington region, home to the largest concentration of federal workers, is expected to be hit hard by a shutdown. The area could lose an estimated $200 million a day, with 700,000 federal workers and contractors facing furloughs. The shutdown could also have a disproportionate impact on the D.C. area, with 60% of federal contractors and 20% of federal workers being sent home. The region's economy, which is heavily reliant on federal spending, is already reeling from the effects of sequestration and budget cuts.\n\n**Government Services Affected**\n\nA shutdown would affect various government services, including:\n\n*   Mail delivery\n*   National parks and monuments\n*   Social Security and Medicare benefits\n*   Child-care services\n*   Small business loans\n*   National parks and monuments\n*   Passport processing\n*   FBI and law enforcement services\n\n**Local Response**\n\nLocal governments in the D.C. area have been preparing for the shutdown by setting aside reserve funds and setting up emergency plans.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks. But for the Washington area, this is a tsunami.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 3547}

The excavation site, which dates back to the 6th century, has yielded a lead vessel containing a relic from the alleged grave of John the Apostle, also known as St. John the Theologian in Bulgarian (Eastern) Orthodox Christianity. The relic, a 6th-century vessel, is less than an inch long and is decorated with crosses.\n\nAccording to Milen Nikolov, the director of the Burgas Regional Museum of History, the vessel was likely brought to the site by a pilgrim from the Foros Peninsula, who then donated it to the early Christian basilica in the fortress. Nikolov believes that the relic was used as a symbol of healing and was believed to have been collected from the grave of John the Apostle in Ephesus, Turkey.\n\nThe discovery is significant, as it is one of only 43 known lead tube reliquaries from the 6th century, and only 20 of these have been found in the world.

Researchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 (15%) were under 50. This trend is raising questions about the current guidelines for screening, which recommend starting at age 50.\n\n**Younger Patients Diagnosed with Advanced Cancer**\n\nThe study found that younger patients (under 50) were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer, including tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. However, despite this, they tended to live longer without a cancer recurrence, with 5-year survival rates ranging from 21% to 95% depending on the stage of cancer. Younger patients were also more likely to receive aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy.\n\n**Current Guidelines and Recommendations**\n\nThe current guidelines recommend starting screening for colon cancer at age 50, but some experts suggest that this age may be too high. Dr. Samantha Hendren, lead author of the study, notes that \"this is a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colorectal cancers are occurring in young people.\" Dr. David Weinberg, a cancer expert, notes that the study's findings are \"a wake-up call to the medical community that we need to be thinking about the increasing incidence of colon cancer in young people.\"\n\n**Risk Factors and Prevention**\n\nThe study did not find a clear reason for the increase in colon cancer rates among younger people, but researchers suggest that environmental factors, such as diet, smoking, and obesity, may be contributing to the trend.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The move, which would be the largest buyout in history, was first announced by Musk in a tweet on Tuesday, stating that he had secured funding to take the company private at $420 per share.\n\n**Background on the Proposal**\n\nMusk's tweet sparked a flurry of questions and concerns, with many investors and analysts questioning whether he had the necessary funding to back up his claim. The board's statement, signed by six of the nine directors, including Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, James Murdoch, and James Rice, confirmed that Musk had opened a discussion with the board about taking the company private, but did not provide details on whether the board was satisfied with the funding Musk claimed to have secured.\n\n**Investors' Reactions**\n\nTesla shares surged to a peak of $368 after Musk's tweet, but fluctuated on Wednesday after the board's statement.

{"pred": "**Harnessing the Power of the Universe: A Quest for Energy and Survival**\n\nA recent paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper has revived the concept of a galactic energy-harvesting model proposed by Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. The three stages of galactic expansion, or \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations, are:\n\n1. **Type I**: Harnessing all the resources of a planet (Earth's current level).\n2. **Type II**: Harnessing all the energy of a star (a goal for humans in the near future).\n3. **Type III**: Harnessing all the energy of a galaxy (a hypothetical goal for advanced civilizations).\n\nAccording to Hooper, a civilization must expand its reach to other galaxies to survive as the universe expands and becomes increasingly inaccessible. This is due to the accelerating expansion of the universe, driven by dark energy, which will eventually make stars beyond our local group unobservable. To counter this, a civilization would need to capture and harness the energy of stars, using a swarm of satellites, or \"Dyson spheres,\" to collect and beam energy back to their home planet.\n\n**Detecting Alien Star-Harvesting**\n\nTo detect these star-harvesting civilizations, astronomers would need to look for:\n\n1. **Accelerating stars**: Stars being pulled towards a central point, indicating a civilization's energy harvesting.\n2. **Unusual light signatures**: Stars with a mass of 20-100 times that of our sun, which would produce detectable radiation.\n3. **Dyson spheres**: Clouds of satellites collecting energy from a star, which would produce detectable radiation.\n\n**Alien Star-Harvesting and Detection**\n\nPhysicist Freeman Dyson proposed the concept of a solid shell of energy-harvesting satellites around a star, which would be detectable as a cloud of radiation. This concept has been explored in science fiction, such as in Olaf Stapledon's novel \"Star Maker\" and Freeman Dyson's own paper. The idea of a civilization harvesting stars is also explored in science fiction, such as in the novel \"Ringworld\" by Larry Niven.\n\n**The Quest for Energy**\n\nThe quest for energy is driving the universe's expansion, and civilizations must adapt to survive. By harnessing the energy of stars, a civilization can expand its reach and ensure its survival. The universe is vast, and the search for energy is a race against time, as the universe expands and becomes increasingly unobservable.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example).

The airline has reduced the number of boarding lines from five to two, with passengers grouped into five categories: Group 1 (Elite and priority passengers), Group 2 (Silver and credit card holders), and Group 3, 4, and 5 (customers with lower-tier status). The new process will also allow passengers to receive push notifications on their mobile devices when boarding begins, reducing the need for early arrivals at the gate.\n\n**Background and Rationale**\n\nThe new boarding process is a result of customer feedback and testing, which began in June 2022. United's managing director of global operations strategy, Maria Walter, stated that the previous process was \"too congested\" and led to \"a lot of angst from our customers.\" The airline tested various boarding concepts, including a two-lane system, which was implemented at Los Angeles International Airport in February and will now be rolled out nationwide.\n\n**Key Features of the New Boarding Process**\n\n- The new boarding process features two lanes, with Group 1 and 2 boarding in Lane 1 and Group 3, 4, and 5 boarding in Lane 2.\n- Group 1 includes Elite and priority passengers, while Group 2 includes Silver and credit card holders.\n- The airline will send push notifications to passengers when boarding begins, allowing them to stay informed and avoid unnecessary waiting.\n- The new process aims to reduce congestion and improve communication between passengers and the airline.\n\n**Comparison to Other Airlines**\n\nUnited joins American and Delta in revising their boarding processes.

Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up.

The company's troubles began when federal marshals raided its Nashville and Memphis facilities, seizing wood and shutting down production. This is not the first time Gibson has faced scrutiny; a similar raid occurred in 2009, when the company was accused of importing ebony from Madagascar.\n\nThe Lacey Act, amended in 2008, requires companies to ensure that the wood they use is sourced from sustainable and legal sources. However, Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims that the company has been unfairly targeted and that the government has not provided clear guidelines on how to comply with the law. Gibson has maintained that it has followed all relevant laws and regulations, but the government has filed a court motion stating that the company's purchase of rosewood from Madagascar was in contravention of the law.\n\nThe issue has sparked debate among the music industry, with some, like Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the Lacey Act as a necessary measure to prevent unscrupulous practices. Others, like Nashville guitar dealer George Gruhn, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature and the potential for unintended consequences.\n\nThe case has also raised concerns about the sourcing of wood for musical instruments, particularly for those made from endangered species like rosewood and ebony. The Environmental Investigation Agency's Andrea Johnson notes that the Lacey Act requires companies to ensure that the wood they use is sourced responsibly, and that Gibson's actions demonstrate a lack of compliance with this law.\n\nThe company's lawyer has argued that Gibson has presented documents to support its claims of compliance, but the government has yet to provide clear guidelines on how to comply with the law.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states.

The European Court of Justice has dismissed Nestlé's appeal, ruling that the company failed to prove that the four-fingered shape of the Kit Kat is distinctive enough to be trademarked across the entire European Union. The decision means that the EU's trademark office will have to reconsider its 2012 decision to grant Nestlé the trademark.\n\nThe case has been ongoing for over a decade, with both companies fighting over the shape of the chocolate bar. Nestlé first applied for the trademark in 2006, but the EU's lower court annulled the decision in 2016, citing that the shape was not distinctive enough in several EU countries. The European Court of Justice has now upheld this decision, stating that a product must be distinctive in every EU country to be granted a trademark.\n\nThe ruling has significant implications for the chocolate industry, as it means that companies will need to prove that their products are distinctive in every EU country to be granted a trademark.

In 2015, the UK's Daily Express reported that the EU's decision could \"spell the end of the Kit Kat\" and that the EU's \"diktat\" could flood the market with copycat products.\n\nThe case has also been compared to a dispute between Nestlé and Cadbury over the purple color used by Cadbury for its chocolate bars.

The researchers analyzed data from 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalizations, which are low-frequency sounds made by pushing air into an esophageal pouch. This behavior is seen in large-bodied birds, such as ostriches and doves, and is thought to be used for mating or territorial displays.\n\nThe study also found that closed-mouth vocalizations are more common in large-bodied birds and non-avian dinosaurs, suggesting that the behavior evolved independently in different groups.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The incident has sparked an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the California Highway Patrol (CHP). \n\nAccording to Tesla, the vehicle was engaged with Autopilot, a semi-autonomous driving system, at the time of the accident. The company stated that the vehicle had received several visual and audible warnings before the crash, but the driver, Walter Huang, did not take any action to avoid the collision. \n\nThe investigation revealed that the crash was caused by a crushed concrete divider, which had been damaged in a prior accident and had not been replaced. The safety barrier, known as a crash attenuator, was not functioning properly, and the Tesla Model X crashed into it, resulting in a severe impact.\n\nThe family of Walter Huang has come forward, stating that he had complained about the issue with the Autopilot system before the accident, claiming that it had swerved towards the same barrier multiple times before. The family has also raised concerns about the safety of the Autopilot system, which they believe may have contributed to the accident.\n\nTesla has responded to the incident, stating that Autopilot is designed to prevent accidents and reduce the risk of fatalities.

This event will be visible from various parts of the world, including Australia, western Asia, and eastern North America.\n\n**What is a Blue Moon?**\nA Blue Moon is a rare occurrence when the second full moon appears in a single month. This happens because the lunar cycle is about 29.5 days, and the full moon appears every 29.5 days. However, the calendar year has 12 months, which means that sometimes an extra full moon appears in a month, making it a Blue Moon.\n\n**Supermoon and Total Lunar Eclipse**\nThe Blue Moon will also be a Supermoon, a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth.

Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

The Muslim Brotherhood's party, the Freedom and Justice party, is expected to make significant gains, potentially securing a majority of seats in the new parliament. The Brotherhood has downplayed its chances, but analysts believe it may win a clear majority, which would give it the authority to form a government without needing to form alliances with other parties.\n\nThe Brotherhood's lead in the polls has sparked concerns about the potential for an Islamist takeover, with some analysts warning that a clear majority would reduce the influence of liberal and secular parties.

The letter, dated May 2012, was published by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, and reveals a man grappling with the moral implications of his creation.\n\nKalashnikov designed the AK-47 in 1947, inspired by his experiences in World War II, where he was wounded fighting for the Red Army. The rifle's simplicity and durability made it a popular choice for military forces worldwide, with over 100 million units sold globally. However, its widespread use by insurgent groups and child soldiers has led to countless deaths and injuries.\n\nIn his letter, Kalashnikov questioned whether he was responsible for the lives lost, despite his intention to design the rifle to defend his country.

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. This increased resistance allows the bacteria to repel common forms of immune responses, making it more difficult to treat. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be inherited.\n\nIn lab studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be more aggressive and better at invading human cells. In fact, the smoke-exposed MRSA was able to kill more mice in lab cultures than those that had not been exposed to smoke. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, stated that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This makes the bacteria more resistant to the immune system's defenses.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has shown that e-cigarette vapor can also make MRSA more resistant to antibiotics. However, the study found that cigarette smoke had a more significant impact on the bacteria, with surface changes increasing 10 times more with exposure to cigarette smoke rather than e-cigarette vapor.\n\nThe study's results suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also makes pathogens more aggressive and resistant to treatment. This is a growing concern, as cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for infectious diseases. The study's findings highlight the need for individuals to refrain from smoking and for healthcare professionals to be aware of the potential risks associated with cigarette smoke.\n\nIn conclusion, the studies suggest that cigarette smoke is not only a risk factor for smokers but also a contributing factor to the growth of superbugs like MRSA.

{"pred": "A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Toulouse, led by Young-Ho Eom, has shed light on the concept of influence and importance in the digital age. The study analyzed Wikipedia pages across 24 major language editions to determine which individuals are considered the most important and influential in the world.\n\nInitially, the study used Google's PageRank algorithm to rank individuals based on the number of links pointing to their Wikipedia pages. However, this method produced unexpected results, with Carl Linnaeus, an 18th-century Swedish naturalist, emerging as the most important person in the world. This was largely due to the fact that Linnaeus' work on taxonomy has led to the naming of countless species, resulting in a large number of links pointing to his Wikipedia page.\n\nTo address this issue, the researchers developed a new method called 2DRank, which combines PageRank and CheiRank (a measure of outgoing links) to determine an individual's influence. Using this method, the study found that Frank Sinatra was the most important person in the English-language world, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII.\n\nHowever, when the study was expanded to include all 24 language editions of Wikipedia, the results changed significantly. According to the 2DRank method, Carl Linnaeus emerged as the most influential thinker in the world, beating out figures such as Jesus, Hitler, and President Obama. This result was attributed to the widespread use of Linnaeus' system of taxonomy, which has led to the naming of countless species and the creation of numerous Wikipedia pages linking back to him.\n\nThis study highlights the complexities of measuring influence and importance in the digital age, and the need for more nuanced methods to account for the quirks of online data. The findings also underscore the enduring impact of Linnaeus' work on the scientific community and the importance of his contributions to the field of taxonomy.\n\nIn a related effort, the Internet Archive is working to preserve and archive Wikipedia pages and the links they contain, with the goal of fixing broken links and preserving the history of online content. This initiative aims to ensure that references to archived pages can be used in place of broken links, allowing users to access the original content intended by the authors.\n\nOverall, these studies demonstrate the importance of considering the complexities of online data and the need for innovative methods to measure influence and importance in the digital age.", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning about the condition, which affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause severe symptoms such as pain in the arms and legs, difficulty breathing, and paralysis.\n\n**What is AFM?**\n\nAFM is a rare condition that can be caused by various germs, including enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. The exact trigger for AFM is often elusive, and there is no specific treatment.\n\n**Symptoms and Outbreaks**\n\nSymptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The condition has been linked to a strain of enterovirus that is now circulating again, which some doctors believe may be the same mysterious, polio-like illness detected in 2014 that paralyzed 120 children. The outbreak in 2014 coincided with an outbreak of enterovirus D68, but the CDC did not detect the virus in AFM specimens collected that year.\n\n**Recent Cases**\n\nRecent cases of AFM have been reported in various states, including California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. A 3-year-old boy from Virginia, Carter Roberts, was diagnosed with AFM in July and can now only move the left side of his face and wiggle a toe. His mother, Robin Roberts, is advocating for more research and awareness about the condition.\n\n**Investigations and Prevention**\n\nThe CDC is investigating the cause of AFM and is advising people to take precautions to prevent the spread of the illness, including washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick people, and cleaning surfaces with a disinfectant. Researchers are also studying the virus to understand its causes and potential treatments.\n\n**Long-term Effects and Recovery**\n\nWhile some children have made significant progress in recovering from AFM, others have been left with long-term effects, including weakness and paralysis.

From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to examine the bloodstains on the shroud.\n\nResearchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth, which bears an image of a crucified man. They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The study concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the Shroud of Turin is likely a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the crucifixion.

It’s not his to take,\" Frances Cobain has said. But sources tell Page Six that Silva isn't giving in, and \"is forcing the matter to litigation.\" The guitar, the one Cobain played during Nirvana's 1993 MTV Unplugged show and also thought to be the last one he played before taking his life, was once insured for $1 million but, per experts, is probably worth several times that now. Back in August, Silva requested $25,000 a month in spousal support and half of any money Frances made during the marriage, and said the couple had no prenup, TMZ reported.

The situation has sparked concerns across the region, with neighboring countries and the international community calling for a swift resolution.\n\n**Background**\n\nOn March 22, a group of soldiers, led by the National Council for the Recovery of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDRE), overthrew President Amadou Toumani Touré, citing his mishandling of an insurgency in the north by Tuareg rebels.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has imposed sanctions on Mali, including a border closure and a freeze on the country's bank account, in an effort to force the junta to step down. The sanctions have led to long lines at gas stations, with fuel imports being cut off, and the country's electricity grid expected to falter in the coming weeks.\n\n**Humanitarian Crisis**\n\nThe crisis has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Mali and neighboring countries, with over 200,000 people displaced since January, including around 100,000 who have fled the country.

{"pred": "**Global Efforts to Eradicate Institutionalization of Children**\n\nThe practice of institutionalizing children, where they are taken away from their families and locked in institutions, is a widespread issue affecting 8 million children worldwide. This problem is not only morally reprehensible but also economically unsustainable. According to JK Rowling, founder and president of Lumos, a charity dedicated to closing child institutions and orphanages, the solution to this issue is not just a moral imperative but also makes excellent economic sense.\n\nLumos was founded in 2005 after Rowling came across a disturbing photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. The charity's mission is to shed light on the lives of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. The vast majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but they are placed in institutions due to a lack of resources, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization on children are severe and long-lasting. They are more likely to experience malnutrition, abuse, and trafficking, and are often left with developmental delays, stunting, and psychological trauma. In fact, research has shown that institutionalized children are far less likely to be educated, physically or mentally well, and are more likely to become dependent on the state in adulthood.\n\nHowever, there is hope for change. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 with the right investment and support. The charity has already achieved significant successes in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70%, 16%, and 54% respectively.\n\nInternational donors play a crucial role in this effort, and their support can make a significant difference. By investing in inclusive education and healthcare, supporting vulnerable families, and promoting family-based care alternatives, children can thrive within their own families and communities.\n\nThe #Letstalklumos campaign, launched by JK Rowling, aims to raise awareness about this critical issue and create a global movement to end the practice of institutionalization. With the support of international donors, governments, and individuals, it is possible to create a world where children are not taken away from their families and locked in institutions, but instead, are loved, cared for, and given the opportunity to thrive.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\" (This female hiker is the \"biggest badass you've never heard of.\")"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2416}

The dinosaur, which lived 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, is a crow-sized, bird-like creature with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of researchers led by paleontologist Xing Xu, who found the fossil in the Hebei Province of China. The fossil was exceptionally well-preserved, with the dinosaur's feathers, bones, and even its internal organs still intact. The researchers were able to study the fossil in detail and discovered that the dinosaur had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, which were likely used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals.\n\nThe researchers used powerful microscopes to detect the remnants of melanosomes, the organelles responsible for pigmentation, in the dinosaur's feathers. They found that the melanosomes in Caihong's feathers were similar to those of hummingbirds, which are known for their iridescent feathers. The team was able to reconstruct the dinosaur's plumage and predict that it had a rainbow-like glimmer, with colors that changed depending on the viewing angle.\n\nCaihong juji is not only significant because of its colorful feathers, but also because it has a unique combination of bird-like and dinosaur-like characteristics. It had a bird-like body, with feathers that were likely used for flight, but its head and crest were more similar to those of a Velociraptor. The dinosaur's tail was also frond-like, with asymmetrical feathers that would have borne the aerodynamic load of flight.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has shed new light on the evolution of feathers and their function in dinosaurs. It is now the oldest known animal to have asymmetrical feathers, a key adaptation for flight. The researchers believe that Caihong's iridescent feathers may have been used for display purposes, but they are not sure how the dinosaur used them or whether males and females had different plumage.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has also raised new questions about the evolution of birds and their ancestors. The researchers believe that the dinosaur's iridescent feathers may have evolved independently of those of modern birds, and that there may have been different ways of creating iridescent color in small raptor dinosaurs before the origin of birds.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Cai", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to the price of sugary drinks, was implemented to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for community college and healthy food subsidies, and improve public health. However, critics argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families, and has driven sales outside city limits.\n\nBusinesses, such as Costco, have seen a significant decline in sales of sugary drinks, with a case of Gatorade increasing from $15.99 to $26.33, a 64% increase. Retailers have responded by posting signs directing customers to locations outside the city limits where they can buy the products without the tax. This has led to a loss of revenue for the city, with some businesses reporting a 34% decline in sales.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, exempting sugary drinks with milk as a primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages, and not applying to food stamp purchases. The tax has been compared to the failed Cook County, Illinois, soda tax, which was repealed after just two months due to public outcry.\n\nA similar tax is being considered for the state of Washington, with a bill re-introduced to impose a tax on sugary drinks statewide.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Myrna Arias, who worked for Intermex from February to May 2014, claims that her boss, John Stubits, required her to install the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone, which tracked her location 24/7.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but she objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours, calling it an invasion of her privacy. Stubits allegedly admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and even bragged about knowing her driving speed and routes.

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark, found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with ADHD and similar disorders.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy were at a higher risk of having children with ADHD-like behaviors.

Saoirse Ronan plays the role of Susie, bringing a natural and honest performance to the film. The movie also features a talented cast, including Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz, and Stanley Tucci, who plays the unsettling role of George Harvey.\n\nHowever, the film has been criticized for its uneven tone, veering from lightheartedness to heavy-handedness. The movie's depiction of heaven, a fantastical world created by Weta Digital, has been described as cheesy and unoriginal. The film's focus on the thriller aspects of the story, including the murder and the investigation, has been praised, but the conceit of Susie trapped in a DayGlo world between life and death has been seen as preachy.\n\nThe movie has been compared to Jackson's previous work, including \"Heavenly Creatures\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, but it has been noted that it lacks the complexity and depth of those films.

The House of Representatives has approved a plan to delay the start of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and repeal the medical device tax, but Senate Democrats have vowed to reject any changes to the health law. President Barack Obama has also stated that he would veto any bill that includes these provisions.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a hardline stance against the ACA, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is determined to block any attempts to gut or delay the law. Reid has taken a tough stance, urging Obama not to engage in direct negotiations with Republicans, and has convinced his caucus to stand firm against any concessions.\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, is expected to be severely impacted by a shutdown. Local economist Stephen Fuller estimates that the region could lose $200 million a day and see over 700,000 jobs affected. The shutdown would also impact tourism, with federally funded attractions such as the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo likely to be closed.\n\nFederal services would also be disrupted, including the processing of benefits such as Medicare, Social Security, and child-care subsidies. Mail would still be delivered, but new applications for these benefits would not be accepted, and \"serious backlogs\" would be expected.

Maryland officials estimate that the state would lose $5 million a day in income tax revenue, while Prince George's County officials say they could lose $270,000 daily.\n\nAs the deadline for passing a spending bill approaches, it is unclear how the situation will be resolved.

Alternatively, a partial government shutdown could occur, which would have significant consequences for the Washington region and the country as a whole.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

It is estimated to be 5-10 times the mass of Earth and has a highly elliptical orbit that takes 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine was made by a team of researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006. Brown and his colleague, Konstantin Batygin, used mathematical and computer modeling to infer the existence of the planet, which they believe is responsible for the unusual motion of small, icy bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system.\n\nThe researchers have not directly observed the planet, but they are confident that it exists based on the gravitational influence it has on the smaller objects. They estimate that the planet is about two to four times the diameter of Earth and is likely an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Brown and his colleagues argue that Pluto does not meet the criteria for a planet, which requires it to \"clear the neighborhood\" around its orbit. They believe that Planet Nine meets this criterion, as it is 5,000 times more massive than Pluto.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on at least two continents searching for the object. Brown and Batygin are hopeful that the planet will be detected within the next few years, and they believe that it will be a significant discovery that will help us better understand the solar system.\n\nIn related news, the New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto in 2015, providing new insights into the dwarf planet's composition and geology. However, the mission has also reignited calls for Pluto to be reinstated as a planet, with some scientists arguing that it meets the criteria for a planet.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over a period of five years, found that those who experienced the largest fluctuations in weight had a 78% higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease (CHD), is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased.

The issue occurred when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The valve, which regulates the flow of ammonia coolant, reached a pre-set temperature limit, causing the shutdown.\n\nAccording to NASA, the crew was never in any danger, and the situation is not considered a life-threatening emergency. However, the problem has forced the crew to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems have been shut down in the Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab.\n\nEngineers are trying to determine whether a software fix can resolve the issue or if a spacewalk is necessary. The decision on whether to proceed with a spacewalk may take a couple of days.

Many people were caught off guard, and the damage was catastrophic.\n\nRicks' forecast was a turning point in the National Weather Service's approach to issuing weather warnings.

This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults.\n\nAccording to the study, which analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011, nearly 15% of patients were under the age of 50. These younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment.\n\nResearchers found that younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) compared to older patients. Despite having more advanced disease, younger patients had a higher five-year survival rate, with 95.1% of patients under 50 surviving with localized disease, 76% with regional disease, and 21.3% with distant disease.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. She noted that the medical community should be aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool.\n\nExperts agree that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults are unclear, but potential contributing factors may include environmental factors, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, suggested that the increase may be due to an environmental effect that is contributing to the rise in colon cancer.\n\nWhile the study's findings raise questions about whether screening guidelines should be altered to start at a younger age, experts caution that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of such a change. Dr. David Weinberg, chairman of medicine at the Fox Chase Cancer Center, noted that starting screening too early may result in a low yield of cancer diagnoses.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the medical community, with Dr. Hendren warning that the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors who will require long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising rates of colorectal cancer among younger adults", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as Warratyi, is significant not only for its age but also for its location in the arid interior of the country, which was previously thought to be uninhabitable at that time.\n\nThe discovery was made by archaeologist Giles Hamm, who was surveying the area with Aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard. Hamm stumbled upon a rock shelter with a blackened roof, indicating human activity, and subsequent excavations revealed a treasure trove of artefacts and bones. The site contains the oldest known evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum, a giant wombat-like species.\n\nThe artefacts found at the site include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre, and gypsum pigments, which suggest that early humans developed these technologies locally, rather than importing them from other parts of the world. This challenges the previous assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as other populations.\n\nThe discovery also pushes back the dates on the development of key technologies, including bone needles, wood-handled stone tools, and gypsum use. The site provides reliably dated evidence of hafted axe technology, which is about 38,000 years old.\n\nThe Warratyi site is significant not only for its age but also for its location, which suggests that humans were able to migrate south from the northern part of the continent to the southern interior much earlier than previously thought. The site also provides evidence of human interaction with megafauna, which challenges the idea that climate change was the primary cause of their extinction.\n\nThe discovery has been hailed as one of the most important in Australian pre-history, and it is expected to rewrite the story of Indigenous Australians. The site is now considered one of the oldest human settlements in the world, and it provides a unique window into the lives of early humans in Australia.\n\nThe excavation team used a combination of optical dating and radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the site, which was found to be between 49,000 and 46,000 years old. The team also used Bayesian age modeling to integrate all the stratigraphic information and derive a combined age estimate for the site.\n\nThe discovery has sparked debate among archaeologists, with some questioning the accuracy of the dating methods used.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "**Harnessing the Power of the Universe: A Quest for Energy and Alien Life**\n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has revived the concept of harnessing energy from distant stars to prevent the universe from expanding beyond our reach. This idea, first proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, suggests that advanced civilizations would need to expand throughout the universe to secure energy before it becomes inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of space caused by dark energy.\n\nAccording to Hooper, the presence of dark energy will cause stars beyond our Local Group of galaxies to fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making them unobservable and inaccessible within the age of the universe. To combat this, advanced civilizations would need to capture and harvest stars from other galaxies, using a swarm of satellites known as \"Dyson spheres\" to collect and beam energy back to their home planet.\n\nDyson spheres, first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, are hypothetical megastructures that could be used to harness the energy of a star. These structures would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, which would hover in space and collect energy from the star, beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres has been explored in science fiction, with authors such as Olaf Stapledon and Larry Niven featuring similar structures in their works. In reality, detecting these megastructures could be a challenge, but Hooper suggests that astronomers could look for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away, or for stars that are being accelerated towards a central civilization.\n\nWhile humans are still far from achieving the level of energy harvesting proposed by Kardashev's Type III civilization, the idea of harnessing the power of the universe is an intriguing one. As we continue to explore the universe and search for signs of alien life, the possibility of encountering civilizations that have already achieved this level of technological advancement is a tantalizing prospect.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* Advanced civilizations may need to expand throughout the universe to secure energy before it becomes inaccessible due to dark energy.\n* Dyson spheres, made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, could be used to harness the energy of a star.\n* Detecting Dyson spheres could be challenging, but astronomers may be able to look for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away.\n* The concept of Dyson spheres has been explored in science", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

{"pred": "Recent discoveries in East Africa have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have uncovered evidence of a significant shift in toolmaking and trading networks among early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This period marks the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, a time of great change and innovation in human history.\n\nThe discoveries, published in three papers in the journal Science, suggest that early humans in the region were responding to dramatic shifts in the climate, which led to unpredictable food sources and the need for greater mobility and resourcefulness. The researchers propose that this led to the development of smaller, more specialized tools, such as spearpoints and blades, which were made from obsidian and other exotic materials brought from distant locations.\n\nThe use of obsidian, a volcanic glass, is particularly significant, as it indicates a level of technological sophistication and the ability to transport and process raw materials over long distances. The team also found evidence of the extraction of pigments, including red and black rocks, which were likely used for symbolic purposes, such as painting or decorating tools.\n\nThese findings challenge the long-held view that modern human behavior and technology emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago, with the \"human revolution.\" Instead, the evidence suggests that complex behaviors and technological innovations were present in Africa much earlier, starting around 300,000 years ago.\n\nThe discoveries also highlight the importance of social networks and exchange between different groups of early humans. The team found that the obsidian and pigments were brought from distant locations, indicating a level of cooperation and communication between groups. This is similar to the way modern hunter-gatherer groups, such as the Hadza people of northern Tanzania, maintain relationships with other groups through gift-giving and other forms of exchange.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior. They suggest that the emergence of complex behaviors and technological innovations was a gradual process that occurred over hundreds of thousands of years, rather than a sudden revolution. The discoveries also highlight the importance of considering the African archaeological record in its own right, rather than viewing it as a precursor to the emergence of modern humans in other parts of the world.\n\nOverall, the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide a fascinating glimpse into the lives of early humans and their technological and social innovations, and challenge our understanding of the evolution of human behavior and culture.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

However, United Airlines has stated that customer feedback was a key factor in developing the new system, and the airline is committed to continuing to improve the boarding process.", "answers": ["The \"angst\" travelers feel at overcrowded gates may soon be eased at United Airlines terminals, an exec for the airline says. That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

The procedure involved creating a pair of ears from Kieran's own ribs, which were harvested and shaped into frameworks for his ears. The surgery was a success, and Kieran is now delighted with his new ears.\n\nKieran was born deaf and had small lobes where his ears should be. However, thanks to previous operations and a hearing aid, he can already hear, albeit with some difficulty. The surgery was primarily cosmetic, aiming to improve Kieran's confidence and self-esteem. His parents, David and Louise Sorkin, were overjoyed with the result, saying they were \"on cloud nine\" after the procedure.\n\nThe surgery was performed by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, who used a template of Louise Sorkin's ears to create the new ears. The procedure involved removing cartilage from Kieran's ribs, shaping it, and sewing it into frameworks that were then inserted into pockets in the skin. The new ears took on the shape of an ear using suction.\n\nThe surgery has brought significant psychological benefits to Kieran, who had struggled with bullying and low self-esteem due to his condition. His parents hope that the new ears will help him fit in with his peers and boost his confidence. Kieran's reaction to his new ears was immediate and positive, with him exclaiming \"Wow!\" and giggling with delight.\n\nThe surgery is a common procedure at Great Ormond Street Hospital, with about 40 operations performed each year. However, researchers are working on a new approach using stem cells to create new ear frameworks and other skeletal structures. This method would be less invasive and could potentially revolutionize the treatment of microtia in the future.\n\nKieran will require a second operation in six months to make his ears stand out from his scalp more. Despite the challenges he has faced, Kieran's story is a testament to the power of medical innovation and the importance of self-acceptance.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

However, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006 has eroded this fundamental right, revoking habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay and foreign nationals labeled \"enemy combatants.\"\n\nThe MCA has far-reaching implications, allowing the executive branch to detain individuals without due process, including US citizens and legal permanent residents. This has led to the indefinite detention of hundreds of men at Guantanamo, many of whom were sold into captivity by warlords for bounties. Despite numerous legal victories, the Bush administration has prevented detainees from receiving a fair hearing in court.\n\nIn a separate development, a New York judge has granted a writ of habeas corpus to two research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, held at Stony Brook University. This historic ruling marks the first time an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus, recognizing the primates as legal persons. The Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the case, sees this as a significant step towards gaining bodily liberty for cognitively complex animals.\n\nThe ruling has sparked debate, with some experts cautioning against reading too much into the decision. However, the Nonhuman Rights Project plans to use this momentum to sway judges in other jurisdictions and file additional cases, including one involving a captive elephant. The organization aims to prove that animals like elephants, great apes, and whales and dolphins are autonomous beings deserving of bodily liberty.\n\nThe intersection of these two stories highlights the importance of habeas corpus as a bulwark against executive power and the erosion of fundamental rights. As the US Supreme Court prepares to hear the Guantanamo detainees' cases for the third time, the fate of habeas corpus hangs in the balance. The outcome will have far-reaching implications for human rights and, potentially, the rights of animals.", "answers": ["The writ of habeas corpus lets prisoners appear in court to make their captors justify why they're being held. Until now in the US, those who've used this legal tactic have been human. But a New York judge yesterday ruled that the writ may be used by two lab chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, Science magazine reports. NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

The raids, which occurred in August 2011, were the second time the company has been targeted by the government, with the first raid taking place in 2009.\n\nThe Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, despite being aware of the risks involved. Gibson, however, denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe controversy has sparked a debate in the music industry, with some, like Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the Lacey Act as a necessary measure to prevent illegal logging. Others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature, which could force guitar builders to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago.\n\nThe raids have also had a significant impact on the guitar industry, with dealers like George Gruhn of Nashville's George Gruhn Guitars warning of a \"nightmare\" scenario where owners may be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The law also covers the trade in vintage instruments, which has led to a decline in business for Gruhn, who has had to nearly eliminate the 40% of his business that dealt with overseas buyers.\n\nThe EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the Lacey Act, stating that its intent is to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that responsible sourcing of wood is necessary. The government has yet to charge Gibson, and the company is seeking a court date to clear its name.\n\nIn a separate development, the Internet Archive has been collecting data from Alexa Internet since 1996, adding it to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.

The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was approximately a mile deep in some areas and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding, announced by NASA scientists, significantly rewrites the planet's ancient history, contradicting previous assumptions that water on Mars was only present in rare and short-lived events.\n\nThe research, led by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, used infrared telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere and analyze the isotopic composition of water molecules. The team found that the water on Mars is enriched in deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, indicating that the planet has lost a significant amount of water over time. By calculating the escape rate of ordinary hydrogen, the scientists estimated that the ancient ocean would have covered the entire planet to a depth of 137 meters if it had been evenly distributed.\n\nHowever, the team believes that the ocean likely formed in the northern hemisphere, which has a lower altitude, and covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface. This finding has significant implications for the search for life on Mars, as a large body of water would have provided a habitable environment for life to emerge and thrive.\n\nThe discovery also suggests that Mars was likely habitable for a longer period than previously thought, with some scientists estimating that the planet was warm and wet for millions of years. The presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere, detected by NASA's Curiosity rover, has sparked speculation about the possibility of life on the planet, although it is still unclear whether the gas is of biological or geological origin.\n\nThe study's findings are supported by other research, which has shown that the early Martian atmosphere was rich in heavy hydrogen and that much of it escaped into space, leading to the planet's current deuterium-rich water composition. While the exact amount of water on ancient Mars is still a topic of debate, the evidence continues to mount that the planet was once a warm and wet world, making it a promising place for life to have emerged.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for our understanding of the planet's history and the search for life beyond Earth.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The case revolves around the shape of the Kit Kat finger wafer, which Nestlé has been fighting to trademark in the European Union (EU) for over a decade.\n\nThe ECJ ruling sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) to review a 2012 decision that upheld Nestlé's trademark on the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit. Mondelez, the owner of Cadbury, had objected to the trademark, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be protected.\n\nThe ECJ found that Nestlé failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive, but also dismissed Mondelez's appeal against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016. This leaves open the possibility that the EUIPO could still preserve protection for Kit Kat's shape, taking into account new evidence that the shape is distinctive to people in more countries.\n\nThe trademark dispute has been closely followed by trademark lawyers, who see implications for brands operating across the EU single market. The case has also been mirrored by a dispute between the two multinationals in the British courts, where Nestlé objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.\n\nThe ruling has significant implications for the Kit Kat brand, which has been a beloved treat in the UK and other EU countries for decades. The case has also been linked to the Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat.\n\nThe saga began in 2002 when Nestlé applied for a trademark in Europe for the Kit Kat shape, which was granted in 2006. However, Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, objected to the trademark, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be protected. The case has been ongoing for over a decade, with multiple appeals and court rulings.\n\nThe ECJ's decision means that the EUIPO must review the 2012 decision, and it is possible that the trademark could be revoked. However, Nestlé has stated that it believes the EU trademark office will side with the company, and the case may not be over yet.\n\nThe ruling also highlights the complexities of trademark law in the EU", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex, may not have roared like they are often depicted in movies and popular culture. According to researchers, the sounds made by dinosaurs were likely more similar to those of birds, with a low, throaty whoosh of air, often referred to as \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" This type of vocalization is characterized by a low-frequency sound produced by pushing air into an esophageal pouch rather than exhaling through an open beak.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization, which is often used for territorial or courtship displays. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, a physiology professor at Midwestern University, noted that the association between large body size and closed-mouth vocalization is due to physics. The inflation of an elastic cavity, such as the esophageal pouch, requires a certain level of lung pressure, which is more easily achieved in larger body sizes.\n\nThe researchers believe that some dinosaurs, particularly those with large body sizes, may have made closed-mouthed vocalizations similar to those of birds today, perhaps during mating displays. However, no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like.\n\nThe study's findings offer a new perspective on the sounds of the ancient world, suggesting that the Jurassic era may have been a more subdued and bird-like place. The researchers plan to continue their study by integrating information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to understand the sounds of extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors.\n\nIn a related article, sound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the movie \"Jurassic Park,\" revealed that he used a variety of animal sounds to create the iconic dinosaur noises in the film. He used a tortoise's mating call for the velociraptors, a horse's breathing for the T. rex, and a goose's hiss for the raptor's attack sound. Rydstrom's creative approach to sound design has become a benchmark for the industry, and his work on \"Jurassic Park\" continues to inspire new generations of sound designers.\n\nOverall, the study and the insights from sound designer Gary Rydstrom offer a fascinating glimpse into the sounds of the ancient world, challenging our traditional notions of what dinosaurs sounded like", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

Despite extensive searches, the plane's fate remains unknown. However, statisticians and experts are using Bayesian statistics, a mathematical technique developed by Thomas Bayes in the 18th century, to help locate the plane.\n\nBayesian statistics involves updating probabilities based on new information, allowing researchers to refine their search area and estimate the likelihood of finding the plane at any given location. This approach has been successfully used in previous searches, including the location of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, a team of statisticians from Metron Inc. used Bayesian statistics to analyze the data and identify the most likely location of the plane. They considered various scenarios, including mechanical failures and pilot error, and combined them with historical data from previous crashes to create a probability map. The team's analysis led to a much tighter search area, which ultimately resulted in the discovery of the plane's wreckage in 2011.\n\nSimilarly, in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Bayesian statistics can be used to update the probability of finding the plane at any given location. However, the search area is vast, and the currents in the Indian Ocean are unpredictable, making it a challenging task. Colleen Keller, a senior analyst at Metron Inc., who worked on the Air France search, expressed doubts about the chances of finding the plane, stating that it's \"very likely if we don't get any breakthroughs, it's at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and we will never find it, sadly.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, researchers are optimistic that Bayesian statistics can help locate the plane.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

This event is even more special as it coincides with a \"Supermoon,\" where the moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon.\n\n**Visibility and Timing**\n\nThe total lunar eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, with the best viewing times in the evening sky. The eclipse will begin at 11:48am UTC and reach its maximum at 1:30pm UTC. For viewers in eastern North America, it will be necessary to wake up early to catch the partial eclipse.\n\n**Supermoon Trilogy**\n\nThis is the third supermoon of the winter season, with the first two occurring on December 3 and January 1, 2018. The supermoons appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than regular full moons.\n\n**Viewing Options**\n\nFor those who cannot view the event in person, the Virtual Telescope project will provide a livestream of the eclipse from Australia, starting at 11:30am UTC. Additionally, the project will also livestream the supermoon rise over Rome's skyline on January 1, 2018, starting at 4:00pm UTC.\n\n**Photography Tips**\n\nTo capture stunning photos of the supermoon or lunar eclipse, NASA recommends using a smartphone or DSLR camera. For smartphone users, tap on the moon on the screen and hold your finger in place to lock the camera's focus, then adjust the exposure slider to get the right balance of light.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

Mubarak faces charges of complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the crackdown on the popular uprising that forced him out of office.\n\n**Prosecutor Demands Harsh Penalty for Mubarak**\n\nIn a scathing critique of Mubarak's rule, Suleiman demanded that the former president be given the \"harshest penalty\" for his crimes. Mubarak's two sons, Alaa and Gamal, are also on trial, facing corruption charges. The trial is seen as a crucial test of the country's commitment to accountability and the rule of law.\n\n**Economic Growth Slows**\n\nThe elections and Mubarak's trial take place amid growing economic concerns, with the country's growth slowing due to the unrest and lack of investment.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

In Philadelphia, about 100 Occupy Philly protesters remained on the cold concrete of Dilworth Plaza on the evening of November 28, despite a deadline set by Mayor Nutter for them to leave. The protesters, who were served squash soup and handed out water, chanted slogans and railed against corporate greed and power. Police looked on calmly, with Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan stating that they had no plans to evict anyone and were working towards a resolution.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the LAPD declared an unlawful assembly on the streets surrounding City Hall and ordered Occupy L.A. protesters to disperse or face arrest. However, police stopped short of clearing the encampment, and four demonstrators were arrested during a brief confrontation. The Los Angeles encampment, which had grown to 2,000 people, remained at City Hall, with police permitting the camp to stay until at least daybreak.\n\nIn contrast to other cities, where police have used force to clear out Occupy camps, the Los Angeles police showed restraint, with one protester even thanking them for their behavior. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa had given protesters until midnight to remove their tents and leave, but later permitted the camp to stay.\n\nThe Occupy movement, which is protesting economic inequality and excesses of the financial system, has been relatively peaceful in Los Angeles, with the city providing ponchos to campers when it rained. However, the mayor has now called for the encampment to be dismantled, citing concerns about public safety and the need for the protesters to focus on spreading their message rather than occupying a particular patch of land.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the city has said it needs to erect fencing for a renovation project at Dilworth Plaza, which has led to a deadline for the protesters to leave. However, many tents and structures remain, and police sources have said that authorities are hoping the rest of the protesters will relocate voluntarily.\n\nThe Occupy movement has gained international attention, with hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons tweeting a message of support to Mayor Nutter, urging him to show restraint. The movement has also gained support from organized labor, clergy, and civil rights groups, with many people showing up to support the protesters in Los Angeles.\n\nOverall, the Occupy movement continues to be a major force in the United States, with protests and demonstrations taking place across the country.

The letter, dated May 2012, was published by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, and reveals a man grappling with the moral implications of his creation.\n\nKalashnikov designed the AK-47 in 1947, inspired by his experiences in World War II, where he was wounded fighting for the Red Army.

{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs: A Growing Concern**\n\nRecent studies have revealed a disturbing link between cigarette smoke and the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing, a key component of the immune system. The smoke-exposed bacteria also become more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are essential in killing bacteria. Furthermore, the study found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be inherited.\n\nIn lab studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be more aggressive and better at invading human cells. The study also found that the smoke-exposed MRSA became more resistant to reactive oxygen species, a chemical burst generated by macrophages to kill pathogens. This suggests that cigarette smoke allows MRSA to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, making it more difficult to kill.\n\nA similar study conducted by the same researchers a year earlier found that e-cigarette vapor also makes MRSA more resistant, but to a lesser extent. The study suggests that cigarette smoke is a more potent trigger for MRSA resistance than e-cigarette vapor.\n\nThe findings of these studies have significant implications for public health. Cigarette smokers are already more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the added resistance of MRSA to antibiotics makes it a more formidable foe. The study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, hopes that the findings will add to the growing body of evidence that highlights the dangers of smoking.\n\nThe study was funded in part by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and involved a team of researchers from the University of California, San Diego, the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, and other institutions. The findings of this study emphasize the need for individuals to refrain from smoking and to take steps to prevent the spread of MRSA and other superbugs.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The study used a method borrowed from Google's PageRank algorithm to analyze links between Wikipedia pages. Initially, the study found that Frank Sinatra was the most important person, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, when the study was expanded to include 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, the results changed, with Adolf Hitler taking the top spot, followed by Michael Jackson and Madonna.\n\nThe study aimed to discover if Wikipedia's level of attention to various figures was skewed by factors such as gender, time, or location. The results showed that most important historical figures on Wikipedia are born in Western countries after the 17th century and are male. However, each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, making the most of its own historical figures born in the countries that use the language of the edition.\n\nThe study also found that the PageRank algorithm was thrown off by a quirk of Wikipedia, which contains a comprehensive collection of named species and their classifications. To address this issue, the researchers used a second method, CheiRank, which measures the number of outgoing links from an article. By combining PageRank and CheiRank, the researchers developed a new measure called 2DRank, which led to Frank Sinatra being ranked as the most important person.\n\nHowever, a separate study by the University of Toulouse's Young-Ho Eom, published in a different context, found that the most influential thinker in the world is actually Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. This study analyzed 24 language editions of Wikipedia and found that Linnaeus' scientific system of naming organisms led to him being linked to a vast number of pages, making him the most influential person. This result was unexpected, as Linnaeus is not typically considered one of the most influential historical figures.\n\nIn contrast, a previous study by Jasleen Kaur, Filippo Radicchi, and Filippo Menczer found that Karl Marx was the most influential scholar, based on how often academics referenced each other in their work.

The condition affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause severe symptoms such as limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech.\n\nThe exact cause of AFM is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Enteroviruses are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children, but when they get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain.\n\nSymptoms of AFM can appear suddenly, often after a respiratory or febrile illness, and can progress rapidly, leaving children with severe and long-lasting paralysis. In some cases, children have been left with permanent weakness or disability.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating the current outbreak and has issued health alerts to states to encourage timely reporting of cases. The CDC is also advising people to practice good hygiene, such as washing their hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick people, and cleaning surfaces with a disinfectant.\n\nWhile there is no specific treatment for AFM, researchers are studying the condition and exploring potential therapies, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Prozac. Some doctors have reported that IVIG may help improve outcomes, but more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness.\n\nThe CDC is also working to understand the cause of AFM, which may be linked to enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a virus that caused a large outbreak of respiratory illness in 2014. However, the CDC has not detected EV-D68 in AFM specimens collected in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe outbreak of AFM has left many families, including the Roberts and Carson families, with a long and difficult road to recovery.

Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to examine the bloodstains on the shroud and compare them to the patterns that would be expected if the cloth had been used to wrap a crucified person.\n\nThe researchers, led by Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth, and found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose. They concluded that the linen appears to have been patched with bloodstains from a standing model, rather than a crucified man or a facedown corpse.\n\nThe study found that the bloodstains on the shroud do not match the patterns that would be expected if the person had been crucified or hung on a cross. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out at 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains even traced angles at odds with each other, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe researchers also found that a simulated spear wound in the chest ran in completely different patterns than the one on the shroud, whether the person was standing or prone. Borrini stated that \"this is just not what happens to a person on a cross.\"\n\nThe study's findings add to the evidence that the Shroud of Turin is a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the time of Jesus. The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, rather than a genuine religious relic, and has never officially weighed in on its authenticity.\n\nThe study's conclusions are based on a scientific analysis of the bloodstain patterns, and are not definitive. However, they do suggest that the shroud may not be what it is claimed to be.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The Martin D-18E, which was played by Kurt Cobain in Nirvana's 1993 \"MTV Unplugged\" concert, is believed to be worth several times its original $1 million insurance value. Frances Bean denies that she gifted the guitar to Silva, who claims it was a wedding present when they secretly married in 2014.\n\nThe dispute has been ongoing since their split in March 2016, with Love, Kurt Cobain's ex-wife and Frances Bean's mother, stating that the guitar is a \"treasured heirloom of the family\" and not Silva's to take. Despite months of negotiation, the matter has reached a deadlock, and Frances Bean is now ready to take the case to court.\n\nMeanwhile, Isaiah Silva is also seeking spousal support from Frances Bean, requesting a minimum of $25,000 per month. He claims that Frances promised to cover his monthly expenses, including private school and housing bills for his child from a previous relationship, when they got married. Silva also alleges that Frances has upwards of $100 million in her father's estate and is seeking half of the money she earned from business deals made during their two-year marriage. However, Frances Bean has made it clear in her divorce documents that the Kurt Cobain money is hers alone and not Silva's, but she is open to paying some spousal support.\n\nThe situation has become increasingly contentious, with Love's manager allegedly sending threatening messages to Silva's ex-girlfriend in an attempt to get the guitar back.

This is often due to poverty, lack of education and healthcare facilities, and discrimination. However, the majority of these children have parents who could care for them, and the solution lies in providing support to these families.\n\nLumos, founded by author JK Rowling, has been working to raise awareness about the issue and provide solutions. The charity has seen significant success in countries such as Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by up to 75% in some areas.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization on children are severe and long-lasting, including malnutrition, developmental delays, and psychological trauma. However, with the right support, children can thrive within their own families and communities. Lumos estimates that with investment in inclusive education and healthcare, and support for vulnerable families, the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050.\n\nInternational donors play a crucial role in this effort, and their funding decisions can greatly influence the availability of support for children and families.

The house, which was likely used for gatherings and feasts, features beautifully worked flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch. Analysis of seeds and charred grains recovered from the site will reveal what the people were growing and eating. The house was never a permanent residence, but rather a place for large gatherings, as suggested by the presence of pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit.\n\nThe Marden Henge site itself is a massive enclosure, measuring 15 hectares, which is larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles. The purpose of the site is believed to have been for status, showcasing wealth and power through the ability to mobilize a massive workforce. The site is so vast that it takes archaeologists 40 minutes to walk from the house to the diggers who have uncovered a previously unrecorded Roman complex.\n\nIn a separate discovery, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to be that of a child, has been unearthed at Wilsford Henge.

The organization has also launched a campaign, #responsiblywild, to promote safe and responsible hiking practices.\n\nWhile the PCT is a challenging and transformative experience for many hikers, some are concerned that the influx of new hikers may change the character of the trail. Rusty, a 71-year-old hiker who has completed the PCT multiple times, expressed a desire to hike without seeing a line of ants all the way to Canada, highlighting the need for a more sustainable and responsible approach to hiking the PCT.\n\nIn addition to the PCT, another hiking movie, \"A Walk in the Woods,\" is set to be released, which may further increase interest in long-distance hiking.

The dinosaur, which lived 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, is a crow-sized, bird-like creature with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of researchers led by paleontologist Xing Xu, who found the fossil in Hebei Province, China. The fossil was exceptionally well-preserved, with the dinosaur's feathers, bones, and even its internal organs still intact. The researchers were able to study the fossil in detail and discovered that Caihong had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, which were likely used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals.\n\nThe researchers used powerful microscopes to detect the remnants of organelles called melanosomes, which are responsible for pigmentation, in the dinosaur's feathers. They found that the melanosomes in Caihong's feathers were similar to those of hummingbirds, which have iridescent feathers. The team was able to reconstruct the dinosaur's plumage and predict that it had a rainbow-like glimmer, with colors that changed depending on the viewing angle.\n\nCaihong's feathers were not only colorful but also had a unique structure, with long, flat melanosomes that were organized into sheets. This structure is similar to that found in the iridescent throat feathers of hummingbirds, which create a metallic sheen that changes color with the viewing angle.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of feathers and the origins of birds. It suggests that feathers evolved for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals, before they were used for flight. The discovery also highlights the diversity of feathered dinosaurs and the complexity of their plumage.\n\nCaihong's frond-like tail has asymmetrical feathers, which would have borne the aerodynamic load of flight. This is a key adaptation that is also found in the iconic bird-like dinosaur Archaeopteryx, but Caihong is the oldest known animal to have this feature.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong has sparked excitement among paleontologists and scientists, who are eager to learn more about this fascinating creature and its place in the history of life on Earth. Further study of the fossil and other feathered dinosaurs may reveal more about the evolution of feathers and the origins of birds.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages, which has led to criticism that the tax is inconsistent and unfair.\n\nThe experience in Seattle is not unique. Cook County, Illinois, repealed its own sweetened beverage tax in 2018 after a public outcry and significant opposition from the beverage industry and retailers. The tax was implemented in August 2017 and was met with a 34% decline in sales of beverages affected by the tax at Costco's nine Cook County locations.\n\nA similar tax is being considered in Washington state, with a bill being re-introduced to impose a tax on sweetened beverages statewide. However, the bill's sponsor, Representative Marcus Riccelli, does not believe it will pass this year.\n\nCritics of the tax argue that it is a form of \"nanny statism\" and that it does not effectively address the root causes of obesity and other health issues. They also point out that the tax is regressive and will disproportionately affect low-income families.\n\nIn contrast, supporters of the tax argue that it is a necessary measure to address the public health crisis caused by sugary drinks. However, the experience in Seattle and Cook County suggests that the tax may not be an effective way to achieve its intended goals.\n\nUltimately, the Seattle sweetened beverage tax has been a failure in implementation, leading to increased prices, decreased sales, and a loss of revenue for the city. It remains to be seen whether a similar tax will be implemented in Washington state or other jurisdictions.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Myrna Arias, who worked for Intermex from February to May 2014, claims that her boss, John Stubits, required her to download the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone, which tracked her location, speed, and routes taken, both during and outside of work hours.\n\nArias objected to the app's GPS function during non-work hours, likening it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet, and informed Stubits that his actions were illegal. However, Stubits allegedly told her to tolerate the intrusion, stating that Intermex was paying her more than her previous employer, NetSpend. When Arias uninstalled the app to protect her privacy, Stubits scolded her and eventually fired her a few weeks later.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Kern County Superior Court, alleges invasion of privacy, retaliation, unfair business practices, and other claims, seeking damages in excess of $500,000. Arias' attorney, Gail Glick, stated that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a legitimate business interest, but if an employee cannot stop it, it is a complete violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy.\n\nThe Xora app, now known as ClickSoftware Solution, is a web-based management application that enables office staff to track employees' locations, dispatch daily worker orders, and analyze driving routes and times.

The plan would delay the start of the law for one year and repeal the law's tax on medical devices. However, Senate Democrats have vowed to reject any changes to the ACA, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto such a bill.\n\n**House Speaker John Boehner's Strategy**\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a hardline stance against the ACA.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The data brokers, which include companies like Acxiom, Experian, and Equifax, collect and sell consumer information to marketers, who use it to target shoppers based on their income, clothing size, and other personal characteristics.\n\nThe report found that some data brokers are selling lists of consumers with specific health conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, and depression, along with their medications. Others are selling lists of consumers' credit scores, addresses, and social security numbers. The data is often sold to third-party companies, including those that specialize in identity theft.\n\nThe World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization, uncovered these lists while investigating how data brokers collect and sell consumer information. The group's executive director, Pam Dixon, testified before Congress that the existence of these lists highlights the need for increased government regulations. Dixon stated that the data brokers are required by federal law to maintain the privacy of a consumer's data only if it is used for credit, employment, insurance, or housing, but that medical information that data brokers get elsewhere is fair game.\n\nThe lists of sensitive information can put people in harm's way, such as the list of over 30,000 police officers' home addresses, which could put the lives of the officers and their families in danger. The list of seniors suffering from dementia could open them up to predatory financial offers.\n\nThe Direct Marketing Association, which represents the data brokerage industry, stated that such lists represent a \"tiny minority\" of marketing products and that the industry recognizes that there are situations in which lists are being used to disparage certain groups.

The discovery was made by Mike Brown, a renowned astronomer at Caltech, and his co-author Konstantin Batygin. According to their research, published in the Astronomical Journal, Planet Nine is estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun at an average distance of 20 times farther than Neptune. The planet's existence was inferred from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system, which appear to be influenced by the gravity of a hidden planet.\n\nBrown, who is often referred to as the \"Pluto killer\" due to his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006, believes that Planet Nine is a significant discovery that could rewrite the textbooks on our solar system. He and Batygin initially set out to disprove the existence of a hidden planet, but their research revealed that the gravitational effects of a massive perturber were the most plausible explanation for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked excitement in the scientific community, with many experts hailing it as a major breakthrough. However, some have expressed caution, noting that the evidence is still circumstantial and that further observations are needed to confirm the existence of the planet. NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has cautioned that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies, and that the Sagan Rule – \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\" – should be applied.\n\nDespite the controversy, Brown remains confident that Planet Nine is real and that it will be detected within the next few years. He believes that the discovery of the planet will be a significant moment in the history of astronomy and will help to shed light on the formation and evolution of our solar system.\n\nIn related news, Brown has spoken out about his role in Pluto's demotion, saying that he has no regrets about his decision to advocate for the reclassification of Pluto. He believes that the controversy surrounding Pluto's status has been blown out of proportion and that the planet's demotion was necessary for the good of science. Brown has also expressed his hope that the New Horizons mission to Pluto will help to shift the focus away from the debate over Pluto's status and towards the study of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies and other small celestial objects beyond Neptune", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over a period of five years, found that those who experienced the largest fluctuations in weight had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased. Cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation in the arteries can lead to atherosclerosis, which can block the blood supply to the heart, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, or heart attack.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, emphasized the importance of maintaining weight loss over time. \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off,\" he said. \"Many people are motivated to lose weight, but then they feel they can take it easy. This information can be used as motivation to keep the weight off.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. The researchers found that individuals with coronary heart disease who experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death compared to those who experienced little change in body weight.\n\nThe study's results suggest that weight fluctuation may be a concern for people with coronary heart disease, and that maintaining a stable weight may be crucial for reducing the risk of heart-related complications. Dr. Bangalore and his team recommend further investigation into the relationship between weight fluctuation and heart health in people with coronary artery disease.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Yo-yo dieting may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death in people with coronary artery disease.\n* The study found that individuals with coronary heart disease who experienced large fluctuations in", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

He took the whole issue of the media, and he had a very candid conversation.\" Politico has an exhaustive list of the topics Trump covered during the 77-minute presser, ranging from nuclear holocaust to CNN, which he downgraded from \"fake news\" to \"very fake news.\" BuzzFeed has video of one of the conference's most heavily commented upon moments: when Trump asked a black reporter if she could set up a meeting between him and the Congressional Black Caucus. Presidential historians tell the AP that no president, including Nixon during the Watergate scandal, has publicly turned on the press the way Trump did. \"It was bizarre theater,\" says Rice University history professor Douglas Brinkley. \"He turned a presidential press conference into a reality-TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.\" GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alice Stewart also found a few things to praise in Trump's performance. \"You can't say he's not responsive to the press,\" she tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \"He answered all the questions from all over the press corps and put to rest the long-standing dialogue that he shuts down certain news outlets.\" Vox lists nine moments that it suggests back up Jake Tapper's description of the press conference as \"wild\" and \"unhinged,\" including Trump's claim that \"the leaks are real\" but \"the news is fake.\" Late-night hosts approached the press conference as gleefully as a kid unwrapping Christmas presents, and the Washington Post rounds up some of their best lines. \"My guess is he did it because he's mad and he just wanted to blow off some steam,\" Jimmy Kimmel said. \"The tone of the press conference was like if your dad found a pack of cigarettes under your mattress.\" David Graham at the Atlantic looks at the continual theme of complaint in the conference and wonders: Does Trump hate his new job?"], "all_classes": null, "length": 10933}
{"pred": "**International Space Station Faces Cooling System Issue, Possible Spacewalk Needed**\n\nThe International Space Station (ISS) has encountered a problem with one of its cooling systems, which may require a spacewalk to repair. The issue occurred on Wednesday when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The valve caused the loop to produce too much ammonia, forcing NASA to reroute coolant into the other loop, Loop-B.\n\nAs a result, the station's crew had to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems were turned off in the NASA's Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab. The crew worked to keep the freezers operational, but the situation has required a cutback in normal operations on the orbiting outpost.\n\nNASA officials have stated that the crew was never in any danger, but the situation has been classified as a \"Big 14\" maintenance issue, which is a type of problem that NASA and its partners expect to face on an occasional basis during space station operations. Engineers are trying to determine whether a software fix can resolve the issue or if a spacewalk will be necessary.\n\nA decision on whether to perform a spacewalk has not been made yet, and it may take a couple of days or up to a couple of weeks to sort through the issues. The space station's life support system is still operational, and the crew is working to resolve the problem.\n\nThe ISS has been continuously occupied since 2000, and the current crew consists of six astronauts from the United States, Russia, and Japan. The space station is scheduled to be maintained through 2020, but the United States and its partners are considering extending its operating life.\n\nThe external cooling loops are critical systems that circulate ammonia outside the station to keep equipment cool.

The current mission of the space station, Expedition 38, is scheduled to go until March 2014.", "answers": ["NASA is reporting a glitch with one of the two cooling pumps on the International Space Station, but it says none of the six crew members are in danger, reports CNN.

On August 28, 2005, Ricks, the forecast coordinator for the Slidell, Louisiana, office, issued a special bulletin warning of a powerful hurricane with unprecedented strength, predicting that \"MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS. PERHAPS LONGER.\" The bulletin, which was titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE,\" also predicted widespread destruction, including roof and wall failure, snapped or uprooted trees, and water shortages that would lead to \"INCREIBLE HUMAN SUFFERING BY MODERN STANDARDS.\"\n\nRicks' forecast was based on his local expertise and experience, having grown up in the hard-hit Lower Ninth Ward section of New Orleans and having survived previous hurricanes, including Betsy and Camille. He recalled that he went through each statement in the bulletin, validating each one and finding it difficult to remove any of them due to their validity for the situation.\n\nThe forecast was not just a prediction, but a personal plea to the public to take the storm seriously and evacuate. Ricks has said that he would rather have been wrong and taken the heat for crying wolf than to have underestimated the severity of the storm. Unfortunately, his forecast was correct, and the images of devastation that followed are a testament to the storm's unprecedented power.\n\nRicks' forecast has been recognized as a model for effective communication during weather emergencies, and the NWS has since encouraged meteorologists to use bold and direct language to convey the urgency and seriousness of a situation. The forecast has also been preserved in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, along with a rosary from Ricks' grandmother that he held during the storm.\n\nThe response to the storm was devastating, with widespread destruction and loss of life. Ricks has said that the response broke his heart, as he had done everything in his power to warn people of the monster that was coming, but it came sooner than expected. The storm's impact was felt for years to come, and its legacy continues to serve as a reminder of the importance of effective communication and preparedness during natural disasters.", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day.

The company has faced criticism after Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda, was bullied off the social network and Instagram following her father's death. The abuse included messages blaming her for her father's suicide and altered pictures of him with bruises around his neck.\n\nTwitter has promised to improve its policies and expand its rules to better handle tragic situations like this one. The company has suspended several accounts related to the incident and is evaluating how to improve its policies regarding self-harm and private information. However, many users, including Imani Gandy, a senior legal analyst, have reported facing constant abuse on the platform due to their race, gender, and medical conditions.\n\nGandy has been targeted by a persistent harasser who has created multiple accounts to continue his abuse. She has reported him to Twitter multiple times, but the company has not taken sufficient action. This is not an isolated incident, as many users have reported similar experiences with Twitter's reporting system.\n\nTwitter's own statement on the issue acknowledges that its tools do not address the problem of persistent harassment. The company's commitment to free expression may be clouding its judgment on this issue, with some critics arguing that it prioritizes the rights of abusers over the safety of its users.\n\nIn response to these concerns, some experts are calling for Twitter to take a more proactive approach to addressing online abuse. Soraya Chemaly, a media critic and feminist activist, recommends that Twitter adopt features from a third-party software called \"Block Together,\" which allows users to automatically block new accounts that send them direct messages.\n\nThe issue of online abuse is not unique to Twitter, but it is a significant problem on the platform.

{"pred": "**Rising Colorectal Cancer Rates Among Younger Adults: A Growing Concern**\n\nA recent study has shed light on a concerning trend: colorectal cancer rates are increasing among younger adults, with one in seven cases diagnosed in individuals under the age of 50. This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults. Researchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that nearly 15% of them were under 50.\n\nYounger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, which can make treatment more challenging. However, they are also more likely to receive aggressive treatment, such as surgery and radiation therapy, which has led to slightly better survival rates compared to older patients.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the medical community should be more vigilant in screening for colorectal cancer in younger adults, particularly those with a family history of the disease. Dr. Samantha Hendren, lead author of the study, emphasized the importance of recognizing warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or a blockage in the colon.\n\nWhile the exact reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults are unclear, researchers speculate that environmental factors, such as a poor diet, smoking, and physical inactivity, may be contributing to the trend. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted that the increase is \"unexplained\" and may be linked to an environmental factor.\n\nThe study's results raise questions about whether screening guidelines for colorectal cancer should be revised to start at a younger age. While some experts argue that starting screening earlier could lead to more cancer deaths, others caution that the benefits may not outweigh the costs and potential harm of unnecessary testing.\n\nUltimately, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in detecting colorectal cancer among younger adults. As Dr. Hendren noted, \"the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\"", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as Warratyi, is significant not only for its age but also for its location in the arid interior of the country. The discovery pushes back the previously accepted timeline of human settlement in Australia, suggesting that people may have arrived in the southern interior 10,000 years earlier than thought.\n\nThe site was discovered by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard while surveying the area. The team excavated over 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile, including the remains of a giant wombat-like species, Diprotodon optatum, and eggs from an ancient giant bird. The artefacts, including burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, and red ochre, suggest that early humans developed these technologies locally, challenging the idea that they were introduced from elsewhere.\n\nThe dating of the artefacts and fossils indicates that humans occupied the site from 49,000 to 46,000 years ago, with some estimates suggesting that the site may be as old as 50,000 years. This is significant because it shows that people were able to migrate south quickly, undermining the idea that the arid centre of Australia was a barrier to human movement.\n\nThe discovery also provides evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon and the giant bird. This challenges the idea that climate change was the primary cause of the extinction of megafauna, and instead suggests that humans may have played a role.\n\nThe Warratyi site is considered one of the most important prehistoric sites in Australia, and its discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the history of human settlement in the country. The site is now being studied further, and its findings are expected to be published in a series of papers in the journal Nature.\n\nThe discovery has also sparked debate among archaeologists, with some questioning the accuracy of the dating methods used. However, the majority of experts agree that the discovery is significant and will help to rewrite the story of Indigenous Australians.\n\nIn related news, the excavation methods used at the Warratyi site have been detailed in a separate study, which describes the use of hand excavation, sieving, and optical dating to determine the age of the site.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "**Harnessing the Power of the Universe: A Quest for Energy and Alien Life**\n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has revived the concept of harnessing energy from distant stars to prevent the universe from leaving a civilization isolated in the vastness of space. This idea was first proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962 as a way to measure the energy consumption of technologically advanced civilizations. According to Kardashev's model, there are three phases of galactic expansion: Level I, where a civilization harnesses all of its planet's resources; Level II, where it harnesses all the radiation of a star; and Level III, where it harnesses all the resources of a galaxy.\n\nHooper's paper suggests that advanced civilizations would need to capture stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of the universe caused by dark energy. This would require a massive amount of energy and resources, which could be achieved by creating a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to harvest the energy of a star. These spheres would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites that would hover around a star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to a nearby planet.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, and has since been featured in various science fiction works, including Olaf Stapledon's novel \"Star Maker\" and Larry Niven's \"Ringworld.\" According to Hooper, advanced civilizations would likely be picky about which stars to harvest, choosing those with a mass of 20 to 100 times that of our sun, which would be viable candidates for capturing and hauling back to their home galaxy.\n\nAstronomers could potentially detect the presence of advanced civilizations by looking for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away. However, humans may not have the precise instruments yet to detect these signatures, and it may be a matter of time before our sun becomes another flaming marble in some distant civilization's collection.\n\nThe search for alien life and the quest for energy are closely linked, and harnessing the power of the universe may be the key to understanding the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

As an only child, I yearned for someone to talk to,\" she said. She gave Sophie quite a glitzy life attending book signings and film festivals. Bacall didn't ignore her human family: The New York Daily News reports her $26.6 million estate was mostly split among her three children; her grandkids reportedly got $250,000 each. And two of her employees also received $20,000 and $15,000, respectively. Considering other famous four-legged heirs, Sophie's 10 grand isn't shocking: Leona Helmsley left $12 million to her Maltese and Alexander McQueen left $82,000 to his three dogs. But the oddest may be Dusty Springfield, who gave orders that her cat be serenaded with her own music and \"marry\" another cat."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1776}

{"pred": "Recent archaeological discoveries in East Africa have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have uncovered evidence of toolmaking advances and trading networks among early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This is significantly earlier than previously thought, challenging the long-held view that modern human behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago.\n\nThe discoveries suggest that early humans in the region responded to dramatic shifts in the climate by developing more sophisticated tools and trading networks. The tools, which include small, standardized pieces such as points and blades, were made from obsidian and other exotic materials that were transported from distant locations. This is the earliest evidence of long-distance transport of raw materials in the East African record.\n\nThe findings also indicate that early humans in the region were able to adapt to changing environments and develop new technologies in response to climate fluctuations. The team found that the transition to Middle Stone Age technology occurred around 300,000 years ago, which is earlier than previously thought. This transition is associated with the emergence of Homo sapiens, but it is not clear whether the technology was developed by this species or by one of its close relatives.\n\nThe discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin are significant because they suggest that modern human behaviors arose much earlier than previously thought, starting in groups that predated our own species. The evidence includes the use of obsidian, the production of small, standardized tools, and the presence of exotic materials such as bright red ochre pigment. These findings challenge the view that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern occurred around 40,000-50,000 years ago and suggest that complex behaviors and technological innovation were present in early human societies.\n\nThe team's findings also highlight the importance of climate change in driving human evolution and technological innovation. The region experienced dramatic shifts in climate, including repeated cycles of drought and heavy rainfall, which would have made life difficult for early humans. In response, they developed new technologies and trading networks that allowed them to adapt to their changing environment.\n\nOverall, the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide new insights into the evolution of human behavior and technology and challenge our current understanding of the \"human revolution.\" They suggest that early humans were capable of complex behaviors and technological innovation, and that these abilities were present in multiple human species, not just our own.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

This decision has been met with widespread criticism, with many questioning the reasoning behind it.\n\nAccording to Apple's marketing chief, Phil Schiller, the decision to remove the headphone jack was a matter of \"courage.\" However, critics argue that this is a far cry from true courage, which involves taking risks and facing challenges head-on. Instead, Apple's decision to abandon the headphone jack is seen as a move driven by hubris, arrogance, and greed.\n\nOne of the main concerns is that the removal of the headphone jack will force users to purchase expensive and unwieldy dongles to continue using their existing headphones. This is seen as a step backward in innovation, as it limits user choice and forces them to adapt to Apple's proprietary system. Furthermore, the decision to remove the headphone jack has also raised questions about the company's commitment to user convenience and accessibility.\n\nCritics point out that there is no technological excuse for removing the headphone jack, as music does not sound better over a Lightning cable or Bluetooth. In fact, wired audio is generally considered to be of higher quality than wireless audio. The removal of the headphone jack has also raised concerns about the impact on users who rely on their phones for work or other purposes, such as temperature sensors, light meters, and personal breathalyzers.\n\nThe decision to remove the headphone jack has also been seen as a move to further Apple's walled garden approach, where users are forced to adapt to the company's proprietary ecosystem.

The procedure, which involved creating a pair of ears from Kieran's own ribs, has given him a new sense of confidence and self-esteem.\n\nKieran, from Hertfordshire, was born deaf and had small lobes where his ears should be. However, thanks to previous operations and a hearing aid, he has been able to hear, albeit with some difficulty. The surgery, led by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The new ears were then grafted onto Kieran's head, with the help of a vacuum to shape the skin to the contours of the new ear.\n\nThe surgery, which took six hours to complete, was a major operation, but it has brought significant improvements in Kieran's quality of life. His parents, David and Louise Sorkin, were overjoyed with the result, saying they were \"on cloud nine\" after the procedure. Kieran's father, David, said that the surgery has boosted his son's confidence exponentially, and that he is now able to perform better at school.\n\nThe surgery is not only a cosmetic procedure, but also has huge psychological benefits. According to Mr. Bulstrode, changing a patient's confidence at a young age can change their whole trajectory in life. Great Ormond Street Hospital performs about 40 of these operations each year, although most are to create one missing ear.\n\nAdvances in tissue engineering may soon make this kind of reconstructive surgery even less invasive. Scientists at the University College London Institute for Child Health are working on creating stem cells from patients' fat tissue, which can be induced to make cartilage or bone. This approach would be far less invasive than the current method of harvesting a child's rib cartilage.\n\nKieran's surgery is a testament to the advancements in medical technology and the dedication of medical professionals who are working tirelessly to improve the lives of children born with rare conditions. With his new ears, Kieran is now able to wear sunglasses and earphones, and is no longer self-conscious about his appearance. His story is a heartwarming reminder of the power of medical innovation and the importance of self-acceptance.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

However, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006 has eroded this fundamental right, revoking the right to habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay and non-citizens labeled as \"enemy combatants.\" This provision has been used to justify the indefinite detention of nearly 800 men at Guantanamo, many of whom were sold into captivity by warlords for bounties.\n\nIn the United States, the MCA has also extended a second-class system of justice to non-citizens, including legal permanent residents, who can be declared \"unlawful enemy combatants\" and denied due process. This compromise of habeas corpus has undermined the foundation of the US legal and constitutional framework, threatening the rights of all citizens.\n\nMeanwhile, a new development in the realm of animal rights has brought attention to the concept of habeas corpus. In a groundbreaking decision, a New York judge granted a writ of habeas corpus to two research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, held at Stony Brook University. This ruling marks the first time an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus, and it could pave the way for the release of the primates and potentially sway judges to do the same for other research animals.\n\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the case, sees this as a significant step towards recognizing the rights of cognitively complex animals, including chimpanzees, elephants, and whales and dolphins. While some experts caution against reading too much into the ruling, the organization plans to use this momentum to file more cases and push for the recognition of animal personhood.\n\nThe intersection of these two stories highlights the importance of habeas corpus as a fundamental right that protects not only human beings but also animals from arbitrary detention and abuse. As the US Supreme Court prepares to hear the Guantanamo detainees' cases for the third time, the stakes are high for the future of this essential right and its implications for all individuals, human and non-human alike.", "answers": ["The writ of habeas corpus lets prisoners appear in court to make their captors justify why they're being held.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps.

The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees.\n\nGibson Guitar CEO Henry Juszkiewicz claims that the company has been unfairly targeted and that the government won't tell him exactly how or if his company has violated the law. The company has been accused of importing ebony from Madagascar, which is banned due to over-harvesting. However, Gibson denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also raised concerns among guitar builders and dealers, who worry about the law's retroactive nature and the potential for owners to be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The law also covers the trade in vintage instruments, which has led some dealers to eliminate overseas business to avoid potential issues.\n\nOn the other hand, some in the industry support the Lacey Act, seeing it as a necessary measure to stop unscrupulous operators and reduce illegal logging. Chris Martin, Chairman and CEO of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., believes that the law is a \"wonderful thing\" and that it's \"tedious, but we're getting through it.\"\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has been investigating Gibson's practices and has concluded that the company knowingly imported tainted wood.

The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was approximately a mile deep in some areas and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding, announced by NASA scientists, significantly rewrites the planet's ancient history, contradicting previous assumptions that water was only occasionally present on Mars.\n\nThe research, led by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, used infrared maps of the Martian atmosphere to study the distribution of water molecules and their isotopic composition. The maps showed that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, indicating that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past. By analyzing the deuterium concentration, scientists estimated that the planet's water loss was equivalent to more than six times the amount currently locked up in the ice caps.\n\nThe study suggests that the ancient ocean would have covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface, with the water pooling into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains. This finding opens up the possibility of habitability and the evolution of life on Mars. The scientists believe that the ocean lasted for millions of years, but eventually receded and froze as the Martian atmosphere thinned and the planet lost its insulation.\n\nThe research also suggests that Mars was likely habitable for a longer period than previously thought, with evidence of standing water for 1.5 billion years, longer than it took for life to emerge on Earth. The search for life on Mars will continue with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, set to launch in 2018, which will look for chemical signatures of life in the Martian soil.\n\nThe study's findings are supported by a separate analysis of the Martian atmosphere, which revealed that the planet's water vapor contains a higher proportion of deuterium than Earth's, indicating that Mars lost a significant amount of water over time. The scientists estimate that the ancient ocean would have reached a depth of around 137 meters if it had covered the entire planet evenly.\n\nWhile the evidence suggests that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, it is still unclear whether life existed on the planet. However, the findings provide strong support for the notion that life might have once existed on Mars, and the search for life on the Red Planet continues to be an exciting area of research", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, the film's charm lies in its portrayal of Will Smith's jaded charm and Margot Robbie's transformation from a clumsy thief to a skilled con artist.\n\nThe casting of the film was a highly publicized process, with several A-list actors considered for the lead roles. Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck were all considered for the male lead, while Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Kristen Stewart, Michelle Williams, Jessica Biel, Rose Byrne, and Olivia Munn were all considered for the female lead. Ultimately, Will Smith and Margot Robbie were cast in the roles.\n\nThe film's directors, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, aimed to create a movie that captures the effortless allure of a classic Hitchcock film.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has dismissed appeals from both companies, sending the case back to the EU's trademark office for review.\n\nThe dispute began in 2002 when Nestlé applied for a trademark for the shape of the four-fingered wafer bar, which was granted in 2006. However, Mondelez (then Cadbury) challenged the decision, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be trademarked. The case has been ongoing for over a decade, with various appeals and court rulings.\n\nThe ECJ's latest decision means that the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must review the 2012 decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark. While the ruling does not necessarily mean that the trademark will be cancelled, it does leave open the possibility that the EUIPO could take into account new evidence of the shape's distinctiveness in various EU countries.\n\nThe case has significant implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The dispute has also been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has featured in the UK's Brexit debate, with some arguing that EU courts have failed to defend a beloved British treat.\n\nThe ruling also highlights the complexities of trademark law, particularly when it comes to shapes and designs. While Nestlé has argued that the four-fingered shape is distinctive and recognizable across the EU, Mondelez has argued that it is not distinctive enough to be trademarked.\n\nThe case is not over yet, and it remains to be seen how the EUIPO will proceed. However, the decision does bring an end to the saga for now, and it may pave the way for other companies to create their own versions of the four-fingered wafer bar.\n\n**Key Players:**\n\n* Nestlé: The Swiss-based company that owns the KitKat brand and has been fighting to trademark the shape of the four-fingered wafer bar.\n* Mondelez: The US-based company that owns the Cadbury brand and has challenged Nestlé's trademark application.\n* EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO): The EU agency responsible for reviewing and granting trademarks.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* 2002: Nestlé applies for a trademark for the shape of the four-finger", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex, may not have roared like they are often depicted in movies and popular culture. According to researchers, the sounds made by dinosaurs were likely more similar to those of birds, with a low, throaty whoosh of air, often referred to as \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" This type of vocalization is characterized by a bird-like sound made by pushing air into an esophageal pouch rather than exhaling through an open beak.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization, which is often used for territorial or courtship displays. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have evolved independently at least 16 times within the bird group, and that it is likely that some non-avian dinosaurs also had this ability.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, a physiology professor at Midwestern University, explained that the association with large body size is a matter of physics, as the inflation of an elastic cavity requires a certain amount of lung pressure, which is more easily achieved in larger animals.\n\nThe researchers also found that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct non-avian dinosaurs, and that it may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, co-occurring with open-mouthed vocalizations.\n\nIn a related study, sound designer Gary Rydstrom revealed that the iconic sounds of the dinosaurs in the movie \"Jurassic Park\" were created using a variety of animal noises, including a tortoise, a horse, a goose, a dolphin, and even a Jack Russell terrier. Rydstrom used these sounds to create the distinctive roars and hisses of the dinosaurs, and even used his own voice to create some of the sounds.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that dinosaurs may have made sounds that were more similar to those of birds, and that their vocalizations may have been used for mating displays and territorial defense. While we may never know for certain what dinosaurs sounded like, this study provides a new perspective on the sounds of these prehistoric creatures.\n\nIn a separate study, researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups, and found that it has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

In 2002, the university attempted to rename the building Memorial Hall, but the Tennessee Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued to keep the original name. However, a Tennessee appeals court ruled in 2005 that Vanderbilt could remove \"Confederate\" from the inscription only after it had returned the donation at its current value.\n\nThanks to anonymous donors, Vanderbilt was able to raise the $1.2 million needed to repay the donation, and the university's Board of Trust authorized the name change this summer. The decision has been praised by students and officials, with Ariana Fowler, president of Vanderbilt Student Government, stating that it demonstrates the administration's commitment to addressing student concerns and promoting diversity.\n\nThe name change is part of a broader trend of universities across the country re-evaluating the implications of their buildings' names. Middle Tennessee State University, for example, is also considering removing the name of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings, despite a new Tennessee law that makes it more difficult to remove Confederate symbols and statues from public places.\n\nThe decision to rename Confederate Memorial Hall is seen as a positive step towards promoting inclusivity and respect for all students, particularly those from diverse backgrounds.

Bayesian statistics, named after 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, is a mathematical approach that allows for the assessment of various scenarios and the combination of probabilities to determine the most likely solution.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, a team of statisticians from Metron Inc, led by Colleen Keller, was called in to help locate the plane. Using Bayesian statistics, they analyzed the available data, including historical crashes and search results, and created a probability map to identify the most likely location of the plane. Although the initial search efforts were unsuccessful, the statisticians were able to refine their model and eventually found the plane in 2011, after re-examining their initial assumptions.\n\nThe use of Bayesian statistics in search operations has been successful in other cases, including the hunt for a U.S. submarine in the 1960s and an Air France jet in 2011. The approach allows for the combination of multiple scenarios and the updating of probabilities based on new information, making it a valuable tool in search operations.\n\nHowever, the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been more challenging, with the use of Bayesian statistics being hindered by the lack of data and the complexity of the search area. Despite this, the approach has been used to refine the search efforts, with the probability of finding the plane in certain areas being updated based on new information.\n\nThe use of Bayesian statistics in search operations has its limitations, with some experts arguing that it is not suitable for situations where new evidence drastically changes the situation. However, others argue that it is a valuable tool for adapting to changing information and bringing discipline to the search process.\n\nIn the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the search efforts have been ongoing for years, with some experts predicting that it is unlikely that the plane will be found. Colleen Keller, who worked on the Air France case, has expressed similar sentiments, stating that it is \"very likely\" that the plane is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and will never be found.\n\nThe use of Bayesian statistics in search operations highlights the importance of combining data and probabilities to determine the most likely solution.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The incident has sparked an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the California Highway Patrol (CHP). According to Tesla, the vehicle was operating on Autopilot with adaptive cruise control engaged when it crashed into a barrier on the 101 Highway near Mountain View, California.\n\n**Investigation Findings**\n\nThe NTSB has recovered data from the vehicle's computer, which shows that the driver had received several visual and one audible warning before the collision. However, the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the crash. Tesla has stated that the severity of the accident was due to a crushed crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier designed to reduce impact, which had not been repaired after a previous accident.\n\n**Previous Complaints and Maintenance Issues**\n\nHuang's family has come forward, stating that he had complained to the dealership about the vehicle's Autopilot system veering towards the same barrier on multiple occasions, with the issue occurring 7-10 times. The family took the vehicle to the dealership, but the issue could not be duplicated. The California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) has acknowledged that replacement work was scheduled for the damaged barrier, but storms delayed the repair.\n\n**Tesla's Response**\n\nTesla has released a statement defending its Autopilot system, stating that it \"unequivocally makes the world safer for vehicle occupants, pedestrians, and cyclists.\" The company also pointed out that its data shows that Tesla owners have driven the same stretch of highway with Autopilot engaged over 85,000 times since its introduction in 2015, with over 200 successful trips per day.\n\n**Autopilot Safety Record**\n\nTesla has highlighted its safety record, stating that there is one fatality every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware, compared to one fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers. The company also claims that its Autopilot system reduces crash rates by as much as 40%.\n\n**Broader Implications**\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the safety of autonomous vehicles and the role of Autopilot in preventing accidents.

This event is even more special as it coincides with a \"Supermoon,\" which occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth. The last time a Blue Moon passed through Earth's umbra was on March 31, 1866, making this event a significant astronomical occurrence.\n\n**What is a Blue Moon?**\n\nA Blue Moon is the second full moon in a single month, which occurs due to the lunar cycle and the Earth's rotation. This rare event happens about once every 2.7 years.\n\n**Supermoon and Lunar Eclipse Details**\n\nThe Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America. The eclipse will begin at 11:48 am UTC and reach its maximum at 1:30 pm UTC. The moon will slowly lose its brightness and take on a reddish hue due to the Earth's atmosphere bending the light.\n\n**Viewing the Event**\n\nThe best time to view the Supermoon is right after moonrise and before sunrise, when the moon is sitting on the horizon. It will appear its biggest and brightest due to the \"moon illusion\" effect. If it's cloudy or too cold to go outside, you can watch the event through a livestream provided by the Virtual Telescope project.\n\n**Photographing the Event**\n\nTo capture stunning photos of the Supermoon or lunar eclipse, use a smartphone or DSLR camera. For smartphones, tap on the moon on the screen and hold your finger in place to lock the camera's focus. For DSLRs, use the daylight white balance and adjust the exposure slider to get the right balance of light. Consider putting the moon in context with a local landmark to create an original shot.\n\n**Safety**\n\nUnlike solar eclipses, the Supermoon and lunar eclipse are safe to view with the naked eye, so there's no need for special glasses.\n\n**Participating Astrophotographers**\n\nThe Virtual Telescope Project has partnered with several astrophotographers from around the world to capture the event, including:\n\n* Dean Hooper (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia)\n* John Stevenson (Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia)\n* Chris Stockdale (Latrobe Valley Astronomical Society, \"Hazelwood Observatory\", near", "answers": ["Look up at the sky on Jan. 31 and you may witness a sight unseen for 150 years.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

The couple had four children and had recently welcomed a new grandchild.\n\nBarry Sherman's net worth was estimated to be $4.77 billion, making him the 15th-richest person in Canada.

Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later.

The elections, which began in November, have seen Islamist groups, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, gain significant ground. The Brotherhood is expected to consolidate its lead in the final round, which covers nine provinces, including the North and South Sinai governorates.\n\n**Prosecutors Accuse Mubarak of \"Tyrannical Rule\"**\n\nMeanwhile, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak resumed, with the chief prosecutor accusing him of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensure his son Gamal would succeed him. The prosecutor, Mustafa Suleiman, described Mubarak's regime as corrupt and said he deserves the harshest penalty for his crimes, including the killing of over 800 protesters during the uprising that forced him out of office.\n\n**Brotherhood Seeks to Consolidate Lead**\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party is working to stretch its lead in the elections, with some estimates suggesting it could win a clean majority of the seats in the full Parliament. The Brotherhood has played down its electoral strength before, but winning a clear majority would enable it to govern without forming a coalition, reducing the power of ultraconservative Islamists and liberal parties.\n\n**Economic Growth Slows**\n\nThe unrest in Egypt has led to a slowdown in economic growth, with foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% to $20.2 billion in the first 11 months of 2011. The benchmark EGX 30 stock index lost 49% last year, making it the third-worst performer among world markets.\n\n**Military Rulers Face Confrontation with Parliament**\n\nThe new Parliament, which is expected to be dominated by the Brotherhood, may face a confrontation with Egypt's military rulers, who intend to retain authority over the hiring and firing of a prime minister to run the interim government. The military rulers have scheduled the first session of the Parliament for January 23, two days before the anniversary of the outbreak of protests that ousted Mubarak.\n\n**Mubarak's Trial Continues**\n\nMubarak's trial is ongoing, with the prosecution presenting its case against him and 10 other defendants, including his two sons, his security chief, and a close associate.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

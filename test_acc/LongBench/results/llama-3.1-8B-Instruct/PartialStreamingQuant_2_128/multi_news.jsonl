Kalashnikov, who was 94 at the time of his death, had previously refused to accept responsibility for the deaths caused by his invention, blaming the policies of other countries for the use of his rifle.\n\nKalashnikov's daughter, Elena, stated that her father's letter was likely composed with the help of a priest, as he had been baptized and had become a devout Christian.

Over 100 million rifles have been sold worldwide, and Kalashnikov's design was influenced by his experiences in the Red Army during World War II.

{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs**\n\nRecent studies have revealed a disturbing connection between cigarette smoke and the virulence of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have discovered that cigarette smoke can alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is linked to the increased ability of the bacteria to evade the reactive oxygen species generated by the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off the infection.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, cigarette smoke acts as an alarm to the bacteria, triggering a stress response that enhances its ability to evade the immune system. This stress response is linked to the increased ability of the bacteria to adhere to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to cause infections.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was four times more resistant to the immune system's macrophages, which are responsible for engulfing and killing bacteria. The study also found that the smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are essential for killing bacteria.\n\nFurthermore, researchers discovered that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more resistant to the effects of reactive oxygen species, which are essential for killing bacteria. This resistance was observed in both human cells and mice, indicating that cigarette smoke can have a significant impact on the virulence of MRSA.\n\nThe study also compared the effects of cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor on MRSA. While e-cigarette vapor had a similar effect on the bacteria, it was less potent than cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke is a significant contributing factor to the increased virulence of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, particularly for smokers and those who are more susceptible to infections. The study highlights the importance of refraining from smoking to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

The study used two methods: PageRank, which measures the importance of a page based on the number of links pointing to it, and CheiRank, which measures the importance of a page based on the number of links it refers to. By combining these two methods, the study found that the most influential person in the world is actually Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist who is credited with developing the system of binomial nomenclature that is still used today. This system allows scientists to classify living things into categories and give them unique names.\n\nAccording to the study, Linnaeus topped the list across all 24 language editions of Wikipedia, beating out other influential figures such as Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, and Adolf Hitler. The study found that Linnaeus' influence is due to the fact that his system of classification is used in the naming of many species, and therefore, many Wikipedia pages refer to him.\n\nHowever, when the study used a different method, called PageRank, which measures the importance of a page based on the number of links pointing to it, the results were different. According to this method, the most important person in the world is actually Frank Sinatra, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII.\n\nThe study also found that the most influential people in the world are often those who have made significant contributions to science and history. For example, Sir Isaac Newton said that he stood on the shoulders of giants, implying that he was influenced by the work of others. Similarly, the study found that many influential people in the world are those who have made significant contributions to science and history.\n\nIn another study, a team of researchers found that the most influential person in the world is actually Karl Marx, based on the number of times his work is referenced in academic papers. However, this study used a different method, which looked at the number of times a person's work is referenced in academic papers, rather than the number of links pointing to them.\n\nOverall, the studies suggest that the most influential people in the world are often those who have made significant contributions to science and history, and whose work has had a lasting impact on the world.", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

Two major companies, Samsung and Microsoft, have recently faced criticism for their data collection practices.\n\n**Samsung's Smart TV Policy**\n\nSamsung's new smart TV policy has sparked controversy, with users comparing it to George Orwell's 1984. The policy allows Samsung and its partners to listen to users' conversations, even when the TV is turned off. The company claims that this is necessary for the voice recognition feature, which can be turned off in the settings menu. However, users have expressed concerns about the potential for data misuse. The policy states that Samsung will collect and transmit data to third-party services, including voice commands, device identifiers, and other usage data. This has drawn comparisons to the telescreens in 1984, where users were constantly being monitored. Samsung's statement claims that data is encrypted and that users can opt out of the feature, but critics argue that this is not enough to alleviate concerns.\n\n**Xbox One's Always-On Listening Mode**\n\nMicrosoft's Xbox One gaming console has also raised concerns about data collection. The new Xbox will always be listening, even when turned off, to quickly respond to voice commands. The new Kinect, a motion-sensing and listening peripheral, will be included with every Xbox One console. This has sparked concerns about constant surveillance, with users comparing it to the always-listening telescreens in 1984. Microsoft claims that the new Kinect will only listen for specific cues, such as the \"Xbox On\" command, and that the company has a long history of prioritizing user privacy.\n\n**Gesture and Voice Recognition Features**\n\nSamsung's smart TV also offers features such as gesture controls and voice recognition, which collect user data to provide personalized recommendations and improve the features. The company collects data on what users watch, click, and search for, as well as voice commands and device identifiers. Users can opt out of these features, but may not be able to use them.\n\n**Xbox's Response**\n\nMicrosoft has responded to concerns about the Xbox One's always-on listening mode, stating that the new Kinect will only listen for specific cues, such as the \"Xbox On\" command.

Then Forbes talked with 10 of Ross' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \"penchant for misleading\" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" The magazine delves into Ross' back story, including how, when he first made the Forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $1 billion, \"everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" per a former colleague. When Forbes told Ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, Ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about—in the amount of \"more than $2 billion,\" assets Ross said he put into the trusts sometime \"between the election and [my] nomination.\" When Forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, Ross cited \"privacy issues\"—and the magazine lays out other problems with Ross' story on the supposed $2 billion transfer.

The founder of Lumos, a charity dedicated to closing institutions and keeping families together, shares a personal account of how she became aware of this issue.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The Manchester Evening News reports Gary heard his wife fall, got to safety, and called for help. Rescuers found the 53-year-old librarian's body at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff with a fractured skull. At a hearing Friday, Jane's was ruled an accidental death due, in part, to using an app instead of a map. \"Apart from potential difficulties caused by poor detail on an electronic map, batteries on mobile phones have a nasty habit of running out just when you need them most,\" the Telegraph quotes a spokesperson for Mountain Rescue England and Wales as saying. A detective says the app map \"would have been small and not as detailed\" and took the couple on a route that was not the safest. A director with Ordnance Survey says hikers should always use the app in conjunction with an actual map \"due to the nature of mobile devices when navigating the real world.\" Authorities also say Jane wasn't wearing appropriate footwear for the hike.

Bloomberg also praised Rick Perry's HPV vaccination plan and Mitt Romney's Massachusetts health care plan, saying that they were unfairly criticized by their opponents. However, he also expressed concerns about the Republican field, saying that some of the candidates' positions on science and health care were \"anti-science.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Indiana Governor Rick Daniels, a potential Republican candidate, defended Rick Perry's debate performances, saying that it was too early to judge him and that he should be given more time to prove himself. \n\n**Government Shutdown and Pakistan**\n\nThe government shutdown has become a contentious issue, with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) blaming the tea party for the stalemate, saying that they are \"making it harder to pass a bill.\" Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) countered that the real culprit was Majority Leader Harry Reid, who \"manufactured a crisis\" over the bill. \n\n**Pakistan and Military Action**\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) called for the US to put all options on the table in dealing with Pakistan, including military action, after US officials accused the country's intelligence of supporting terrorist operations.

The tax was implemented to discourage people from drinking sugary drinks and raise revenue for the city's programs, but it has had the opposite effect. Many residents are voting with their wallets, heading to neighboring cities and suburbs to buy their sugary drinks, depriving the city of the revenue it was counting on.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed after just two months due to public outcry. The tax added a penny per ounce to sugary drinks and artificially sweetened beverages, but it was widely unpopular. Retailers and restaurants saw a decline in sales, and customers took their business elsewhere, leading to a significant loss of revenue for the city.\n\nSimilar taxes have been implemented in other cities, including Philadelphia and Berkeley, California, but none have been as successful as the proponents had hoped. In fact, a study by the Tax Foundation found that the tax had the opposite effect, with people heading to neighboring cities to buy their sugary drinks.\n\nIn Seattle, the tax has led to significant price increases for popular items like Gatorade and soda. A case of Gatorade that cost $15.99 now costs $26.33, a 64% increase. Retailers like Costco have taken to posting signs directing customers to nearby suburbs where they can buy the same products without the tax.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for being regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families who rely on sugary drinks as a cheap alternative to other beverages. The tax also doesn't apply to milk-based drinks, which are often used to make soda, leading to a \"tax avoidance\" strategy by retailers.\n\nThe tax has also led to a significant decline in sales for retailers and restaurants, with some seeing a 34% decline in sales. The tax has also led to a significant increase in sales in neighboring suburbs, where people can buy their sugary drinks without the tax.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for being poorly implemented, with the city's own public health officials admitting that the tax was not effective in reducing consumption of sugary drinks.

The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The standoff between the White House and Congress has led to a stalemate, with the Senate and House at odds over the fate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.\n\n**House Republicans' Plan**\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has proposed a spending bill that includes a one-year delay of the health care law and a repeal of the tax on medical devices. However, Senate Democrats have vowed to reject any bill that includes these provisions, and President Obama has threatened to veto such a bill.\n\n**Senate Democrats' Strategy**\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline stance against the Republican plan, refusing to make any concessions on the health care law.

The shutdown could also affect the national parks, the Smithsonian museums, and other attractions, with the potential for a \"tsunami\" of economic losses.\n\n**Economic Impact**\n\nThe economic impact of a shutdown is expected to be significant, with the Washington region losing $42 billion annually in federal payroll and $5 billion in tax revenue.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

This is a stark contrast to the current guidelines, which recommend screening for colon cancer starting at age 50.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, found that younger patients with colorectal cancer were more likely to have advanced disease, but they also lived longer without a recurrence of cancer. Younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery and radiation therapy, and their five-year survival rates were higher than those of older patients. The study's findings suggest that the current guidelines may need to be reassessed to account for the increasing rates of colorectal cancer in younger people.\n\nThe study's results show that:\n\n* 37,847 patients under 50 were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, representing 15% of the total cases.\n* Younger patients were more likely to have advanced disease, with 50% more likely to have cancer that had spread to other organs.\n* Younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%).\n* Five-year survival rates were higher for younger patients, with 95% of patients under 50 living without recurrence, compared to 92% of older patients.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, notes that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer in younger people are unclear, but it may be related to environmental factors, such as diet, smoking, and physical inactivity.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The three stages of galactic expansion, or \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations, are:\n\n1. **Type I**: Harnessing all the resources of a planet (e.g., Earth).\n2. **Type II**: Harnessing all the energy of a star, using a swarm of satellites, such as Dyson spheres, to collect and beam energy back to the home planet.\n3. **Type III**: Harnessing the energy of a galaxy, using a network of satellites to collect and utilize the energy of multiple stars.\n\nAccording to Hooper, a civilization must expand its energy-harvesting capabilities to survive the accelerating expansion of the universe. The universe's dark energy is causing galaxies to move beyond the cosmic horizon, making it impossible to access energy from distant stars. A civilization must capture and harness stars from other galaxies to ensure its survival.\n\n**The Quest for Energy**\n\nAstrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev's model has been revived by Dan Hooper, who proposes that a civilization would need to capture and harness stars from other galaxies to survive.

The energy-harvesting aliens would likely be able to detect the radiation from the captured stars, which would be visible in the light from the star.\n\n**Detecting Alien Energy Harvesting**\n\nAstrophysicist Dan Hooper suggests that astronomers could detect the energy-harvesting aliens by looking for:\n\n* **Accelerating stars**: Stars that are being accelerated towards the star-harvesting civilization would produce a detectable radiation signature.\n* **Dyson spheres**: A swarm of satellites collecting energy from a star would produce a detectable radiation signature.\n\n**The Search for Alien Life**\n\nThe search for alien life has been ongoing for decades, with scientists and science fiction authors proposing various methods for detecting energy-harvesting civilizations. Some of these methods include:\n\n* **Dyson spheres**: A swarm of satellites collecting energy from a star.\n* **Statites**: A cloud of satellites that would hover in space, collecting energy from a star.\n* **Kardashev's Type III**: A civilization harnessing the energy of a galaxy.\n\n", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Apple's marketing chief, Phil Schiller, claimed that the decision was made with \"courage,\" implying that the company was taking a bold step forward by abandoning the standard headphone jack. However, critics argue that this move is not courageous, but rather a sign of arrogance and a desire to sell more expensive, proprietary accessories.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack is seen as a major step back for Apple, as it forces users to purchase expensive and unwieldy adapters or opt for wireless headphones, which many argue do not sound as good as traditional wired headphones. The iPhone 7's new design also eliminates the ability to charge the phone and listen to music at the same time, a feature that was previously a standard for iPhone users.\n\nCritics argue that Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack is a sign of the company's growing arrogance and desire to control the market.

The new ears are designed to be as close to the shape of his mother's ears as possible, which will help Kieran to feel more confident and accepted by his peers.\n\nKieran was born with a rare condition called bilateral microtia, where he had small lobes where his ears should be.

The island's parliament has passed a law that makes possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) of marijuana a petty offense, punishable by a fine rather than a criminal record. This move is seen as a major victory for Jamaican lawmakers and the country's cannabis industry.\n\nThe new law, which was passed after years of debate and lobbying, will also allow for the cultivation of small quantities of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The law will also permit the use of marijuana for Rastafarian religious purposes, a significant step forward for the island's spiritual community.\n\nThe new law will establish a licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. This will enable Jamaican scientists to develop innovative products, such as marijuana-derived medicines like \"Canasol,\" which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients.\n\nThe law will also allow tourists who have a medical marijuana prescription to apply for permits to buy Jamaican ganja, which is known locally. This move is expected to boost Jamaica's tourism industry and create new economic opportunities.\n\nHowever, the law does not mean that Jamaica is softening its stance on international drug trafficking. The country's national security minister, Peter Bunting, emphasized that the law will not create a \"free-for-all\" in the cultivation and export of marijuana, and that the country will continue to enforce its international treaty obligations to combat transnational drug trafficking.\n\nJamaica's move follows a trend of relaxation of marijuana laws in other countries, including the United States, where several states have legalized medical and recreational use. The country's commerce minister, Anthony Hylton, sees the cannabis industry as a potential source of revenue and innovation, citing the success of local scientists in developing products like Canasol.\n\nThe new law is expected to boost Jamaica's economy and create new opportunities for the country's health and tourism industries. However, the law's implementation will require further refinement, including the establishment of a licensing authority to regulate the industry.\n\n**Key Developments:**\n\n- Jamaica's parliament passes a law making possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana a petty offense.\n- The law establishes a licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.\n- Jamaica's national security minister, Peter B", "answers": ["Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself.

Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

By using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer algorithms, they were able to reconstruct YouTube videos from brain activity patterns. The study, published in Current Biology, used the brain activity of the researchers themselves as subjects, watching YouTube videos and then reconstructing the videos based on their brain patterns.\n\nThe study, led by neuroscientist Shinji Nishimoto, used a computer model to match brain activity with visual information, such as colors, shapes, and movements. The reconstructed videos were blurry and dream-like, but showed a continuous and dynamic representation of the original videos. This achievement is a significant step towards understanding how the brain processes visual information and may lead to the development of technology that can decode brain activity into visual images.\n\nThe researchers believe that this technology could be used to broadcast imagery from the brain, including dreams, memories, and even intentions. They envision a future where people can control their environment by imagining movements, similar to people with paralysis using brain-computer interfaces.\n\nWhile the technology is still in its infancy, the potential applications are vast. It could be used to help people with paralysis control their environment, and even potentially decode memories and dreams. However, the accuracy of the technology is still limited, and more research is needed to improve its resolution and capabilities.\n\nThe study's lead author, Shinji Nishimoto, said that understanding how the brain works in natural conditions is crucial for developing this technology. The team is working on analyzing more brain areas and building models for each part of the visual system. They believe that with more data and better computers, they can improve the resolution of the reconstructed images and unlock the potential of brain-computer interfaces.\n\nThe potential applications of this technology are vast, from decoding brain activity to reconstructing memories and dreams.

Despite extensive searches, the plane's location remains a mystery. The search area is vast, and the Indian Ocean's unpredictable currents make it difficult to predict where the plane might be. \n\nStatistical tools, specifically Bayesian methods, have been used to refine the search area and update the probability of finding the plane.

The study, which covered 188 countries from 1980 to 2013, found that obesity rates have increased globally, with no country showing a decline in obesity rates over the past 30 years.\n\nThe United States leads the world in obesity rates, with 13% of its population being obese, despite having only 5% of the world's population. However, other countries are also struggling with high obesity rates, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and New Zealand, where men have the highest rates of obesity, and Kuwait, Egypt, and Bahrain, where women have the highest rates.\n\nThe study found that obesity rates are increasing in both developed and developing countries, with over 50% of men in Tonga and over 50% of women in Kuwait, Egypt, and other countries having obesity rates. In developing countries, 22% of girls and 13% of boys are overweight or obese.\n\nThe researchers attributed the rise in obesity to the increased availability of cheap, high-calorie foods and decreased physical activity. The study also found that obesity is a major risk factor for heart disease, diabetes, and other health complications, with 3.4 million people dying annually due to obesity-related complications.\n\nThe study highlights the need for global action to address the growing obesity crisis, with the World Health Organization launching a commission to study and address the issue. The researchers emphasized that obesity is a complex problem that requires a comprehensive approach to address the root causes, including diet, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors.\n\nThe study also found that over 50% of the world's obese population resides in developing countries, with the Middle East and North Africa being the most affected regions. The researchers called for a global response to address the alarming rates of obesity worldwide, which is a major risk factor for various health complications.\n\nThe study also noted that the problem is not just a matter of personal choice, but also a result of societal and economic factors, such as the availability of cheap, high-calorie foods and decreased physical activity.

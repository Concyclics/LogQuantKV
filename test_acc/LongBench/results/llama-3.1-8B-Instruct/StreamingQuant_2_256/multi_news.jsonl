However, the protesters refused to leave, and instead, they served squash soup, handed out water, and held a \"human mic\" to amplify their voices. The protesters, who were estimated to be around 2,000, were peaceful and calm, with some even complimenting the police for their restraint.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the LAPD declared an unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to disperse from the streets surrounding City Hall. However, the protesters refused to leave, and the police eventually gave them a 4 a.m. deadline to vacate the area. Despite the deadline, the protesters remained, and the police did not make any arrests. The standoff continued into the early hours of Monday, with police officers and protesters facing off in the streets.\n\nIn a similar scenario, the Occupy LA protesters in Los Angeles were given a midnight deadline by Mayor Villaraigosa to vacate the area.

{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs: A Growing Concern**\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the alarming relationship between cigarette smoke and the virulence of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Research conducted by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander and her team at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, has revealed that cigarette smoke can fuel the virulent rampage of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses.\n\nAccording to the study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, cigarette smoke extract was found to make MRSA more resistant to the immune system's defenses, including macrophages and antimicrobial peptides. The study found that the smoke-exposed MRSA was four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. Furthermore, the smoke-exposed MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells, making it easier for the bacteria to invade and cause infection.\n\nThe study also found that the effects of cigarette smoke on MRSA were more pronounced than those of e-cigarette vapor, with cigarette smoke increasing the surface area of the bacteria by 10 times more than e-cigarette vapor. This suggests that cigarette smoke plays a significant role in making MRSA more resistant to the immune system.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, particularly for smokers who are more susceptible to infectious diseases. The study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, emphasized that cigarette smoke not only harms the smoker's respiratory and immune systems but also makes the bacteria more resistant to the immune system, making it harder to treat infections.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has shown that cigarette smoke can alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses.

Then Forbes talked with 10 of Ross' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \"penchant for misleading\" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" The magazine delves into Ross' back story, including how, when he first made the Forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $1 billion, \"everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" per a former colleague. When Forbes told Ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, Ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about—in the amount of \"more than $2 billion,\" assets Ross said he put into the trusts sometime \"between the election and [my] nomination.\" When Forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, Ross cited \"privacy issues\"—and the magazine lays out other problems with Ross' story on the supposed $2 billion transfer.

The shocking truth is that most of these children could be with their families if there was a supportive environment and alternative care options available.\n\nLumos, a charity founded by JK Rowling, aims to eradicate this practice by 2050. The organization has made significant progress in countries like Moldova, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70% since 2007.

However, it appears that the entire story was fabricated.\n\nThe investigation was sparked by a Pishtacos legend from Andean mythology, which tells of a group of serial killers who strung up their victims' torsos to extract fat. The police initially presented a gruesome tale of a gang that had been using this method to harvest fat, which they claimed was sold to the cosmetics industry. However, the investigation was marred by a lack of evidence, and the police were unable to corroborate the claims.\n\nThe police's claims were met with skepticism from the start, with many experts questioning the feasibility of selling human fat to the cosmetics industry.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The Manchester Evening News reports Gary heard his wife fall, got to safety, and called for help. Rescuers found the 53-year-old librarian's body at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff with a fractured skull. At a hearing Friday, Jane's was ruled an accidental death due, in part, to using an app instead of a map. \"Apart from potential difficulties caused by poor detail on an electronic map, batteries on mobile phones have a nasty habit of running out just when you need them most,\" the Telegraph quotes a spokesperson for Mountain Rescue England and Wales as saying. A detective says the app map \"would have been small and not as detailed\" and took the couple on a route that was not the safest. A director with Ordnance Survey says hikers should always use the app in conjunction with an actual map \"due to the nature of mobile devices when navigating the real world.\" Authorities also say Jane wasn't wearing appropriate footwear for the hike.

The tax was seen as a burden on low-income families and was criticized for its complexity and lack of consistency.\n\nIn Seattle, the tax has been seen to have a significant impact on businesses, particularly those that sell sugary drinks. A case of Gatorade, for example, increased from $15.99 to $26.33, a 64% increase.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark, found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen were more likely to have children diagnosed with ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder (HKD).

These individuals, who were once celebrated for their achievements, have seen their fortunes change due to a combination of circumstances.\n\n**1. Anthony Scaramucci**\n\nAnthony Scaramucci, the former White House Communications Director, was fired in July 2017, just 10 days after his appointment. His tenure was marked by controversy, including protocol breaches and public feuds with other officials. His short-lived stint was also marred by a divorce filing by his wife and a messy public feud with other Trump administration officials.\n\n**2. Chris Christie**\n\nGovernor of New Jersey and presidential contender Chris Christie has seen his reputation plummet due to his association with the Bridgegate scandal, where a traffic jam was orchestrated to target a rival politician. His attempts to secure a cabinet position in the Trump administration were unsuccessful, and his reputation remains tarnished.\n\n**3. James Comey**\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey's reputation took a hit after publicly announcing an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email use, which some attribute to Donald Trump's electoral victory. His firing by President Trump in 2017 sparked controversy, with multiple conflicting justifications provided by the White House.\n\n**4.

His tenure was marked by a 40% decline in Ford's stock value and a 5% increase in corporate revenue. His decision to invest in electric and autonomous vehicle technology was met with skepticism by investors.\n\n**5. Tiger Woods**\n\nGolf superstar Tiger Woods has seen his reputation decline significantly since a DUI incident in 2017.

However, Senate Democrats say they will reject any bill that includes changes to the health law. The Senate is expected to quickly pass a bill to reject the amendments to the spending bill, which would then be sent back to the House.\n\n**Senate Democrats' Strategy**\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has taken a hardline stance against the Republican plan, saying that the party will not make any concessions on the health law.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks. But for the Washington area, this is a tsunami.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 3547}

The issue occurred on Wednesday when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The malfunction caused a pre-set temperature limit to be reached, forcing NASA to reroute the cooling system and reduce operations on the station.\n\nThe crew, consisting of six astronauts from the United States, Russia, and Japan, was never in any danger, according to NASA spokesman Josh Byerly.

He has also spoken about the emotional toll of the disaster, saying that he would rather have been wrong in his prediction than to have been responsible for not warning people of the impending disaster.\n\nRicks' warning was not just a one-time event, but part of a larger effort by the National Weather Service to use bold and direct language in their forecasts to convey the severity of a storm.

Researchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 patients, or 15%, were under 50. This is a stark contrast to the current guidelines, which recommend screening for colon cancer to begin at age 50.\n\n**Younger Patients Diagnosed with Advanced Cancer**\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, found that younger patients (under 50) were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer, including tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. However, despite this, they tended to live longer without a cancer recurrence, with 95% of patients under 50 surviving five years without a recurrence, compared to 92% of patients over 50.\n\n**Increased Aggressiveness in Treatment**\n\nYounger patients were also more likely to receive aggressive treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy, with 72% of patients under 50 undergoing surgery and 53% receiving radiation therapy. This may be due to the fact that younger patients tend to have more advanced cancer, but also live longer without a recurrence.\n\n**Risk Factors and Screening Guidelines**\n\nThe study highlights the need for doctors to be more vigilant in screening for colorectal cancer in younger patients, particularly those with a family history or other risk factors. Dr. Hendren notes that patients with a family history of colorectal cancer should begin screening earlier, and doctors should be more proactive in diagnosing and treating younger patients.\n\n**Uncertainty and Future Directions**\n\nWhile the study raises concerns about the increasing rates of colorectal cancer in younger adults, the reasons behind this trend are still unclear. Researchers note that lifestyle factors, such as a poor diet, smoking, and physical inactivity, may contribute to the increase. Dr. David Weinberg notes that the data does not support expanding screening to younger age groups, citing the low yield of screening in this age group.\n\n**Recommendations and Next Steps**\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the medical community needs to be more proactive in screening for colorectal cancer in younger adults. Dr. Hendren notes that the current guidelines may need to be revised, but more research is needed to determine the best course of action.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The three stages of galactic expansion, or \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations, are:\n\n1. **Type I**: Harnessing all the resources of a planet (Earth's current level).\n2. **Type II**: Harnessing all the energy of a star (a goal for humans in the near future).\n3. **Type III**: Harnessing all the energy of a galaxy (a hypothetical goal for advanced civilizations).\n\nAccording to Hooper, a civilization must expand its energy reach to survive as the universe expands and becomes increasingly inaccessible. This can be achieved by creating a swarm of satellites, called Dyson spheres, to collect and harness the energy of a star. These satellites would be made up of individual \"statites\" that balance against the star's radiation, creating a cloud of energy around the star.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres has been explored in science fiction and science, with authors like Olaf Stapledon and Freeman Dyson proposing the idea of harnessing the energy of a star by creating a shell of satellites around it. This would allow a civilization to expand its energy reach and survive the expanding universe.\n\n**The Warning Sign**\n\nAs the universe expands, a civilization would need to harvest stars from other galaxies to survive. This would be detectable by astronomers as a \"star-harvesting\" signature, which would be visible in the light from the star. The energy-harvesting aliens would likely be looking for stars with masses between 20-100 times that of our sun, as these would be the most efficient to harness.\n\n**The Detection Challenge**\n\nCurrently, our technology is not advanced enough to detect these signatures, but scientists believe that advanced civilizations would be able to harness the energy of stars and other galaxies, making them visible to us. The search for these signatures is a warning to humans that we need to expand our energy reach to survive the expanding universe.\n\n**The Search for Aliens**\n\nThe search for extraterrestrial life has been ongoing for decades, with scientists exploring various methods to detect signs of alien civilizations.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

A team of researchers, led by paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, has found evidence of the Middle Stone Age, a period characterized by the use of smaller, more specialized stone tools, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This is tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought.\n\nThe team discovered a range of stone tools, including obsidian, which was transported from 25-50 kilometers away, and red and black pigments, which were used to color the tools. The tools were made with great care and precision, suggesting a high level of technological innovation. The researchers believe that the climate-driven changes in the region, such as the shift from a wet to dry climate, may have driven the development of these new tools.\n\nThe discovery suggests that early humans in Africa were capable of complex behaviors, such as using pigments and making tools with precision, much earlier than previously thought. The new findings also challenge the view that modern human behavior emerged in Africa around 50,000 years ago, and instead suggest that it began much earlier.\n\nThe researchers also found evidence of long-distance trade of raw materials, including obsidian, which was transported from 25-50 kilometers away.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The country's parliament has passed a law that makes possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) of marijuana a petty offense, punishable by a fine rather than a criminal record. This move is seen as a major victory for Jamaican lawmakers, who have been debating the issue for decades.\n\nThe new law also allows for the cultivation of up to five plants on private premises for personal use, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. Jamaica's Commerce Minister, Anthony Hylton, believes that the cannabis industry has great potential for the island, citing the creation of marijuana-derived products such as \"Canasol,\" which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients.\n\nThe new law will also enable tourists to apply for permits to buy small amounts of Jamaican \"ganja\" for medical purposes. The move is part of a broader trend of relaxing marijuana laws in the Americas. Over 20 US states have decriminalized marijuana for medical use, and several countries, including Uruguay and Argentina, have also relaxed their laws.\n\nJamaica's decision to decriminalize small-scale marijuana possession is seen as a significant step towards correcting decades of \"elephantine\" debate and controversy. The country's National Security Minister, Peter Bunting, stated that the new law does not create a \"free-for-all\" in the cultivation and export of marijuana, and that the country remains committed to combating international drug trafficking.\n\nThe move is also seen as a significant step towards promoting health tourism and the development of a medical cannabis industry.

The company's troubles began when federal marshals raided its Nashville and Memphis facilities, seizing wood and shutting down production. This is not the first time Gibson has faced scrutiny; a similar raid occurred in 2009, when the company was accused of importing ebony from Madagascar.\n\nThe Lacey Act, amended in 2008, requires companies to ensure that the wood they use is sourced responsibly. The law is enforced by the U.S. Justice Department, which has been investigating Gibson's practices. The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, claims that the government has not provided clear information on how the company has allegedly violated the law. Gibson has maintained that it has complied with U.S. and Malagasy law, but the government has filed a court motion stating that the company's purchase of rosewood from Madagascar was contraband.\n\nThe case has sparked debate among the music industry, with some, like Chris Martin, Chairman of the C.F. Martin Guitar Company, supporting the Lacey Act as a necessary measure to prevent unscrupulous practices. Others, like Nashville guitar dealer George Gruhn, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature and the potential for unintended consequences.

Scientists have discovered that an ancient ocean, at least 137 meters deep, covered nearly half of the Martian surface, with the water pooling in the northern hemisphere. This finding contradicts previous theories that Mars' water was only present in short, isolated events.\n\n**Water Loss and Deuterium Enrichment**\n\nThe team of scientists, led by NASA's Geronimo Villanueva, analyzed the Martian atmosphere using powerful telescopes and found that the planet has lost a significant amount of water over time. The loss of water has led to a higher concentration of deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen) in the Martian water, with a ratio of 7 times higher than Earth's. This suggests that Mars lost at least 6 times more water than it currently has in its polar ice caps.\n\n**Ancient Mars: A Promising Place for Life**\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the red planet. Scientists believe that the water on Mars was present for millions of years, creating a habitable environment for life to emerge. The longer water persisted on Mars, the higher the chances of life existing on the planet. The team's findings suggest that Mars was once a more promising place for life to gain a foothold.\n\n**Water Loss and the Escape of Ordinary Hydrogen**\n\nThe team's calculations suggest that the ancient Martian surface water would have reached a depth of 137 meters if it had covered the entire planet. However, the water pooled in the northern hemisphere, creating a vast ocean. The loss of ordinary hydrogen due to the planet's weak gravity has led to a higher concentration of deuterium in the Martian water.\n\n**A Wet Mars: A New Picture of the Red Planet**\n\nThe study reveals that Mars was a wet planet with a significant amount of water, which contradicts previous theories of a dry and barren Mars.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

He used a tortoise's mating call, a baby tortoise's squeal, and a rattlesnake's sound to create the sounds of the dinosaurs. The sounds were then manipulated to create the desired effect.\n\nThe study's findings also have implications for our understanding of the evolution of bird vocalizations. The study found that closed-mouth vocalizations are more common in large bird species and are linked to the size of the animal. The study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization has evolved independently in different groups, including birds and non-avian dinosaurs.\n\nThe study's results also suggest that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization can be linked to the size of the animal, with larger animals being more likely to use this type of vocalization.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The decision comes as part of a broader national movement to re-evaluate the implications of Confederate symbols and names on university campuses.\n\nThe university's Chancellor, Nicholas S. Zeppos, stated that the name \"Confederate Memorial Hall\" is a \"symbol of racism, slavery, and pain\" and that it is \"not acceptable\" for students to walk past it or live in the building. The name change was made possible after the university agreed to pay $1.2 million to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the organization that donated the original $50,000 to name the building in 1933. The money was pledged by anonymous donors, and the university will use the name \"Memorial Hall\" instead.\n\nThis decision is part of a larger effort to address the legacy of racism and slavery in the United States. The university has been working to address diversity and inclusion issues, including the hiring of a chief diversity officer and the creation of a diversity and inclusion team.

Middle Tennessee State University is also trying to remove the name of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings, while the University of Tennessee has faced criticism for keeping the name of a building named after Forrest.\n\nThe decision to rename the building has been met with criticism from some, including Doug Jones, a Nashville attorney who represented the United Daughters of the Confederacy in a lawsuit against Vanderbilt University.

The Southern Baptist Convention has also urged its members to stop displaying Confederate flags, and the Tennessee state government has passed a law making it more difficult to remove Confederate symbols from public places.\n\n**Background on the Issue**\n\nThe university's decision to rename the building is part of a broader national movement to address the legacy", "answers": ["In an attempt to bury a relic of its past, Vanderbilt University announced Monday that it will pay more than $1 million to remove the word \"Confederate\" from one of its dorms, the Tennessean reports.

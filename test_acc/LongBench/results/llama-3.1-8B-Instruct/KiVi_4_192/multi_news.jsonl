{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs: A Growing Concern**\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the alarming effects of cigarette smoke on the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. This increased resistance allows the bacteria to repel common forms of immune responses, making it more difficult to treat. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be inherited.\n\nIn lab studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be more aggressive and better at invading human cells. In fact, the smoke-exposed MRSA was able to kill more mice than non-exposed MRSA. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, stated that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances its survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with a previous study that examined the effects of e-cigarette vapor on bacterial resistance. While e-cigarette vapor did make MRSA more resistant, it was not as effective as cigarette smoke in making the bacteria more aggressive.\n\nThe study's results suggest that cigarette smoke functions like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. This is a concerning finding, as cigarette smokers are already more susceptible to infectious diseases. The study's authors hope that their findings will add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.\n\nIn conclusion, the studies highlight the alarming effects of cigarette smoke on the growth and aggression of superbugs like MRSA.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning about the condition, which affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause severe symptoms such as limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech.\n\n**What is AFM?**\n\nAFM is a rare condition that can be caused by various germs, including enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. The exact trigger of AFM is often elusive, and there is no specific treatment.\n\n**Symptoms and Outcomes**\n\nSymptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The condition can be severe, with some patients requiring ventilator support. While most patients recover partially, only a few have fully recovered. In 2014, 120 cases of AFM were reported, with 85% of children recovering partially, but only three fully recovering.\n\n**Recent Outbreaks**\n\nA cluster of AFM cases was reported in Colorado in 2014, coinciding with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). The CDC issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing. As of November 13, 2014, 88 cases were reported in 32 states.\n\n**Investigation and Prevention**\n\nThe CDC is collaborating with partners nationally to investigate reported cases, risk factors, and possible etiologies of this condition. While the specific causes of AFM are still under investigation, being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent a number of severe diseases, including poliomyelitis. Prevention of viral infections includes general hygienic measures, such as frequent hand washing with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick persons, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.\n\n**Personal Stories**\n\nSeveral families have shared their personal stories of dealing with AFM.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to examine the bloodstains on the shroud.\n\nResearchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth, which bears an image of a crucified man. They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The study concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the Shroud of Turin is likely a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the crucifixion.

{"pred": "**Global Efforts to Eradicate Institutionalization of Children**\n\nThe practice of institutionalizing children, where they are taken away from their families and locked in institutions, is a widespread issue affecting 8 million children worldwide. This problem is not only morally reprehensible but also economically unsustainable. According to JK Rowling, founder and president of Lumos, a charity dedicated to closing child institutions and orphanages, the solution to this issue is not just a moral imperative but also makes excellent economic sense.\n\nLumos was founded in 2005 after Rowling came across a disturbing photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. The charity's mission is to shed light on the lives of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. The majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but they are placed in institutions due to a lack of resources, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization on children are severe and long-lasting. They are more likely to experience malnutrition, abuse, and trafficking, and are often left with developmental delays, stunting, and psychological trauma. The impact of not having a dedicated carer is profound, leading to a lifetime of poverty and dependency.\n\nHowever, there is hope for change. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 with the right investment in inclusive education and healthcare, support for vulnerable families, and alternative care options such as fostering and adoption. The charity has already achieved significant successes in countries like Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by up to 75%.\n\nInternational donors play a crucial role in this effort, and their support can make a significant difference. The EU, the US, and the Global Alliance for Children have made commitments to end institutionalization, and there is now a critical mass of expertise and evidence to build on.\n\nTo raise awareness and create a global movement, JK Rowling has launched the #Letstalklumos campaign, which encourages people to share their stories and support the cause. With the right support and commitment, it is possible to create a world where children are not taken away from their families and locked in institutions, but instead thrive within their own families and communities.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer.

She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

Directed by Joe Johnston, the movie stars Benicio Del Toro as Lawrence Talbot, a man who is bitten by a werewolf and transforms into the creature. The film is a mix of traditional horror elements and modern special effects, but it has been met with mixed reviews.\n\nThe movie takes place in the 1890s in rural England and follows Talbot's journey as he searches for his missing brother and becomes a werewolf himself. The film's cast includes Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, and Hugo Weaving, but they are underutilized in the story. Del Toro's performance as Talbot has been criticized for being too similar to Lon Chaney Jr.'s iconic portrayal in the original film.\n\nThe film's special effects have been praised for their visual beauty, but criticized for being dated and over-reliant on CGI. The movie's violence is also graphic, but it does not add to the story. The film's atmosphere and mood are its strongest aspects, with Johnston doing a good job of capturing the spirit of the original Universal horror films.\n\nOther films released in 2010 include \"Valentine's Day,\" a romantic comedy directed by Garry Marshall, which has been panned for its lack of originality and poor performances. The film features a large ensemble cast, including Ashton Kutcher, Jennifer Garner, and Jessica Alba, but it fails to deliver any laughs.\n\nIn contrast, \"Ajami,\" a drama set in an Israeli ghetto, has been praised for its urgent and immediate portrayal of Arab life.

So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\" (This female hiker is the \"biggest badass you've never heard of.\")"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2416}

The discovery was announced in the journal Nature Communications and has shed new light on the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs.\n\nCaihong juji, which translates to \"rainbow with a big crest\" in Mandarin, is a crow-sized, bird-like dinosaur with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds. The dinosaur's feathers were found to be iridescent, with microscopic structures called melanosomes that were responsible for pigmentation. The melanosomes were detected using powerful microscopes and were found to be pancake-shaped, similar to those of hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji suggests that the Jurassic Period was a more colorful time than previously imagined, with dinosaurs sporting vibrant feathers that may have been used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The dinosaur's plumage was likely used for both social and sexual cues, with its iridescent feathers possibly glinting in the sunlight like a rainbow.\n\nCaihong juji's body was found to be well-preserved, with its feathers and bones fossilized together. The fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Hebei Province, China, and was later acquired by the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning. The team of scientists led by Dongyu Hu, a paleontologist at China's Shenyang Normal University, examined the fossil and found that its melanosomes were similar to those found in modern bird feathers.\n\nThe researchers were able to reconstruct the dinosaur's plumage and found that its head, chest, and parts of its tail had melanosomes that were long, flat, and organized into sheets, similar to those found in hummingbirds. This suggests that Caihong juji may have had a rainbow-like glimmer to its feathers. The team couldn't reconstruct the exact colors of the dinosaur's feathers, but they suspect that the observed pigments gave Caihong a rainbow glimmer.\n\nCaihong juji's discovery is significant not only because of its colorful feathers but also because it has a bird-like body, including the types of feathers required for flight. However, it has a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor. The dinosaur's frond-like tail has asymmetrical feathers, which would have borne the aerodynamic load", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

However, the tax has been met with widespread opposition and criticism. The tax has led to significant price increases, with a case of Gatorade rising from $15.99 to $26.33, a 64% increase. Retailers like Costco have responded by posting signs directing customers to locations outside city limits where they can buy the product without the tax.\n\nThe tax has been particularly burdensome for low-income families, who are disproportionately affected by the regressive tax. Many Seattle residents are upset about the tax, questioning its effectiveness in reducing sugar consumption and its impact on local businesses.

The tax was seen as a failure, with many retailers and restaurants experiencing a decline in sales and customers shopping elsewhere to avoid the tax.\n\nA bill to bring a similar tax to Spokane, Washington, has been re-introduced, but local business owners are worried about the potential impact on their businesses. The tax would add nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold and would also include a tax on syrups and powders used to make soda.\n\nCritics of the tax argue that it is ineffective in reducing sugar consumption and that it disproportionately affects low-income families. They also point out that the tax is regressive and that it does not apply to all sugary drinks, such as those sold at Starbucks.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The county's high rate of missing persons reports is attributed to several factors, including the cannabis industry, which attracts people from all over the country and can make it difficult for law enforcement to track their whereabouts. Many people in the industry may not communicate with friends and family, and some may even go off the grid for weeks or months.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and the Eureka Police Department have implemented various measures to address the issue, including using the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) to track missing persons cases. However, the process can be frustrating for families who are searching for their loved ones, as seen in the case of Vikki Joseph, whose brother Jeff disappeared in 2014 while working in the cannabis industry. Despite extensive investigation, Jeff's case remains unsolved, and his family has had to take on much of the investigative work themselves.\n\nThe county's high rate of missing persons reports has also led to concerns about the accuracy of the data.

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark, found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with ADHD and similar disorders.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy were at a higher risk of having children with ADHD-like behaviors.

However, the researchers emphasized that the study does not show a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.\n\nThe study's authors propose that acetaminophen may interfere with maternal hormones critical for fetal brain development, citing previous studies in rats and humans. However, other experts have questioned the relevance of these findings to human health. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at Case Western Reserve University, noted that ADHD is a complex disorder with multiple risk factors, including genetics, and that the study does not provide conclusive evidence of a causal link between acetaminophen use and ADHD.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked concerns about the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy.

Here are five notable examples:\n\n1. **Anthony Scaramucci**: The former White House Communications Director's tenure was the shortest in history, lasting only 11 days. Scaramucci's tumultuous time in the Trump administration was marked by protocol breaches, conflicting statements, and a profanity-laced interview. His wife even filed for divorce during his brief stint.\n\n2. **Chris Christie**: The former Governor of New Jersey and 2016 presidential contender has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the state's history. His reputation was damaged by the Bridgegate scandal, and his attempts to curry favor with Donald Trump ultimately fell flat. Christie's recent decision to lounge on a state-owned beach during a government shutdown only added to his unpopularity.\n\n3. **James Comey**: The former FBI Director was a polarizing figure during the 2016 presidential election, with some attributing Trump's victory to his investigation of Hillary Clinton. However, Trump abruptly fired Comey in May 2017, citing conflicting justifications. Comey's tenure was marked by controversy, including his public criticism of Clinton's email server and his decision to announce an investigation just days before the election.\n\n4. **Mark Fields**: The former CEO of Ford Motor Company was shown the door in 2017 after failing to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Despite investing in electric and autonomous vehicle technology, Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure. Fields' attempts to woo shareholders by reducing the global workforce were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n5. **Tiger Woods**: The professional golfer's reputation has been marred by controversy since reports of his infidelity surfaced in 2009. His latest scandal involved a DUI arrest, which revealed a combination of prescription medications in his system. Woods has not won a major tournament since and is currently ranked 899, his lowest ranking ever.\n\nThese individuals, among the 50 listed by 24/7 Wall St., serve as a reminder that power and fame can be fleeting, and circumstances can change rapidly.", "answers": ["Power: One day you have it, the next you don't.

The House of Representatives has approved a plan to delay the start of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and repeal the medical device tax, but Senate Democrats have vowed to reject any changes to the health law. President Barack Obama has also threatened to veto any bill that includes these provisions.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a hardline stance on the ACA, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is determined to block any attempts to gut or delay the law. Reid has taken a tough stance, urging Obama not to engage in direct negotiations with Republicans, and has convinced his caucus to stand firm against any concessions.\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, is expected to be severely impacted by a shutdown. Local economist Stephen Fuller estimates that the region could lose $200 million a day and see over 700,000 jobs affected. The shutdown could also lead to a loss of income tax revenue for local governments, with Maryland officials estimating a loss of $5 million a day.\n\nThe potential shutdown has already caused concern among lawmakers, with Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-VA) warning of the \"devastating\" ripple effects on state and local governments. Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-VA) is also concerned about the impact on agencies such as the FBI and CIA, which have employees living in the area.\n\nAs the deadline for passing a spending bill approaches, it is unclear how the situation will be resolved. The House and Senate could agree to a compromise, but it is also possible that a short-term funding bill will be passed to buy more time. Alternatively, a partial government shutdown could occur, which would have significant consequences for federal workers, contractors, and local governments.\n\n**Key Players:**\n\n* House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH)\n* Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV)\n* President Barack Obama\n* Rep.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

{"pred": "NASA has announced its upcoming mission to study the sun, previously known as the Solar Probe Plus, will now be called the Parker Solar Probe. The mission is named after Eugene Parker, a renowned astrophysicist who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. Parker's theory was initially met with skepticism but was later confirmed by satellite observations. The Parker Solar Probe will be the first spacecraft to fly directly into the sun's corona, the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere, and will provide unprecedented insights into the sun's behavior.\n\nThe spacecraft will be equipped with a 7.5-foot-wide heat shield made of advanced carbon-composite material to protect it from temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The probe will make 24 close flybys of the sun, some of which will bring it within 3.9 million miles of the solar surface, seven times closer than any other probe has ever gotten to the sun.\n\nThe mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will also help protect equipment from solar radiation and provide insight into the physics of stars. The mission is scheduled to launch in July 2018 and will take seven years to complete. The spacecraft will eventually orbit within 3.7 million miles of the sun's surface, providing a unique opportunity to study the sun's behavior up close.\n\nThe mission is a significant step forward in our understanding of the sun and its impact on the solar system. The findings from the Parker Solar Probe will have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the sun's behavior and its effects on Earth. The mission is a testament to the importance of Eugene Parker's work and his contributions to the field of astrophysics.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is not just a scientific mission, but also a technological achievement. The spacecraft will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the blazing sun. The arrays will retract and extend as the spacecraft moves around the sun, keeping it at a safe temperature and powering it with the sun.\n\nThe mission will also help us better understand the risks associated with space weather.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

According to reports, Neiman Marcus's computer network was penetrated by hackers as far back as July, with the breach not being fully contained until January 1. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, stating that some customers' payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at their stores. Neiman Marcus has apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner, citing a need to confirm evidence before making a public announcement.\n\nIn a similar incident, Target Corp. suffered a massive data breach that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts, as well as the personal information of 70 million people. A 17-page report from computer firm iSight provides new insight into the hack, revealing that the malware used was placed in the store's point-of-sale systems and was able to extract credit and debit card data from the memory of the systems. The report suggests that the malware was created in regions with known software capabilities, including Eastern Europe and Brazil.\n\nA separate report prepared by federal and private investigators suggests that the Target breach was part of a broader and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. The report, sent to financial-services companies and retailers, offers some of the first details to emerge about the source of the attack.\n\nBoth Neiman Marcus and Target have offered to provide customers with one year of free credit monitoring, similar to what Target has already done.

The company also has data on consumers' health conditions, including the number of OB/GYN doctor visits they have had in the past year and the number of whiskey drinks they have consumed in the past 30 days.\n\nThe World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization, has also uncovered lists of sensitive consumer information, including the home addresses of police officers, domestic violence shelters, and people with addictive behaviors towards drug and alcohol. The organization's executive director, Pam Dixon, testified before Congress that these lists highlight the need for increased government regulations to protect consumer privacy.\n\nCurrently, data brokers are only required to maintain the privacy of consumer data if it is used for credit, employment, insurance, or housing. However, medical information that data brokers collect from other sources, such as the purchase of over-the-counter drugs and other health care items, is fair game.

The discovery was made by researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006.\n\nBrown and his team used mathematical and computer modeling to infer the existence of the planet, which they believe is exerting a gravitational influence on the orbits of smaller objects in the outer solar system. They estimate the planet's mass to be five to 10 times that of Earth and its diameter to be two to four times that of Earth.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Brown argues that Pluto's demotion was necessary for the good of science and that it is now clear that the solar system has eight dominant objects, which are the planets we know.\n\nBrown's team has been searching for the planet using telescopes on at least two continents, but it has not yet been directly observed. They believe that the planet is too distant to be seen with current technology, but they are hopeful that it will be discovered within the next few years.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also led to a reevaluation of the solar system's structure and the possibility of other undiscovered planets. NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has cautioned that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system, but Brown and his team believe that the evidence for Planet Nine is strong.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Pluto's status as a planet has been ongoing since its demotion in 2006. Many scientists argue that Pluto should remain a planet, citing its unique characteristics and the fact that it has been thought of as a planet for three-quarters of a century. However, Brown believes that Pluto's demotion was necessary to clarify the definition of a planet and to prevent the inclusion of hundreds or thousands of other small worlds as planets.\n\nIn related news, the New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto in 2015, providing new insights into the dwarf planet's composition and geology.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over a period of five years, found that those who experienced the largest fluctuations in weight had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease (CHD), is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased. The buildup of cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation in the coronary arteries can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and preventing weight fluctuations. \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off,\" he said. \"This data can be used as motivation to keep the weight off.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. Researchers have found that people with CHD who experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death compared to those who experienced little change in body weight.\n\nThe study's results suggest that weight fluctuations may have serious health implications for people with coronary heart disease, particularly those who are overweight or obese. The researchers found that individuals who were overweight or obese at study baseline and experienced the largest changes in body weight had 117% more heart attacks, 124% more deaths, and 136% more strokes compared to those who experienced the smallest body weight changes.\n\nWhile the study's findings are concerning, the researchers note that it is observational and cannot prove cause-and-effect between yo-yo dieting and increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another.

The issue occurred when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The valve, which regulates the flow of ammonia coolant, reached a pre-set temperature limit, causing the shutdown.\n\nAccording to NASA, the crew was never in any danger, and the situation is not a life-threatening emergency. However, the problem has forced the crew to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the freezers that preserve scientific samples.

This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults.\n\nAccording to the study, which analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011, nearly 15% of patients were under 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment.\n\nResearchers found that younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) compared to older patients. Despite having more advanced disease, younger patients had a higher five-year survival rate, with 95.1% surviving with localized disease, 76% with regional disease, and 21.3% with distant disease.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. She noted that the medical community should be aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool.\n\nExperts agree that the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unclear, but possible contributing factors include environmental influences, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, suggested that the increase may be linked to an environmental factor.\n\nThe study's findings raise questions about whether screening guidelines for colon cancer should be altered to start at an earlier age. While some experts argue that the risk is still low, others believe that the increasing incidence of colon cancer among younger adults warrants further research and consideration of earlier screening.\n\nUltimately, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in detecting colorectal cancer among younger adults, as well as a reevaluation of current screening guidelines to ensure that younger individuals receive timely and effective care.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, contains a treasure trove of artefacts and bones, including the earliest known evidence of human interaction with megafauna.\n\n**Discovery and Excavation**\n\nThe site was discovered by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard while surveying the area. Excavations revealed over 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile. The team used a combination of optical dating and radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the site, with results indicating human settlement between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago.\n\n**Significance of the Find**\n\nThe discovery pushes back the earliest known dates for human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by 10,000 years, with humans arriving in the area around 49,000 years ago. The site also contains evidence of the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and South-East Asia, as well as the development of key technologies such as bone needles, wood-handled stone tools, and gypsum use.\n\n**Evidence of Megafauna Interaction**\n\nThe site contains bones from the extinct giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and eggs from an ancient giant bird, suggesting that early humans were interacting with Australia's legendary megafauna. While it is unclear whether they were hunting them, the discovery provides significant evidence of human-megafauna interaction in the region.\n\n**Impact on the Debate**\n\nThe find challenges the prevailing view that climate change was the primary cause of megafauna extinction, with some researchers suggesting that human hunting may have played a significant role. The discovery also challenges the Eurocentric view of Indigenous Australians as being less innovative than other populations, with researchers suggesting that they were capable of developing complex technologies and adapting to their environment.\n\n**Future Research**\n\nThe study has sparked debate among archaeologists, with some questioning the accuracy of the dating methods used.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "**Harnessing Energy from the Universe: A Quest for Advanced Civilizations**\n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has revived the concept of harnessing energy from distant stars to prevent the universe from expanding beyond reach. This idea, first proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, suggests that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies to secure energy before they become inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of the universe.\n\nAccording to Hooper, the presence of dark energy is causing space to expand at an alarming rate, and within 100 billion years, stars beyond our Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making them unobservable and inaccessible. To counter this, advanced civilizations would need to capture and harvest energy from stars before they become lost forever.\n\nHooper proposes the use of Dyson spheres, a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites that could hover around a star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to a nearby planet.

Hooper suggests that these civilizations would be picky about which stars to capture, focusing on those with a mass of 20 to 100 times that of our sun, which would be viable candidates for capturing and hauling back to their home galaxy.\n\nAstronomers could potentially detect these star-harvesting civilizations by looking for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away. However, humans may not have the precise instruments yet to detect these signatures, and it may be a matter of time before our sun becomes another flaming marble in some distant civilization's collection.\n\nThe concept of harnessing energy from the universe is not just a theoretical exercise, but a necessary step for advanced civilizations to survive in an expanding universe. As we continue to explore the universe, we may one day discover evidence of civilizations that have taken this step, and it may be a sign of their advanced technology and ingenuity.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

{"pred": "Recent archaeological discoveries in East Africa have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have uncovered evidence of a significant shift in toolmaking and trading networks among early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This period marks the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, a time of great change and innovation in human history.\n\nThe discoveries, published in three papers in the journal Science, suggest that early humans in the region were responding to dramatic shifts in the climate, which led to unpredictable food sources and the need for greater mobility and resourcefulness. The researchers propose that this led to the development of smaller, more specialized tools, such as spearpoints and blades, which were made from obsidian and other exotic materials brought from distant locations.\n\nThe use of obsidian, a volcanic glass, is particularly significant, as it indicates a level of technological sophistication and the ability to transport and process raw materials over long distances. The team also found evidence of the extraction of pigments, including red and black rocks, which were likely used for symbolic purposes, such as painting or decorating tools.\n\nThe findings suggest that early humans in the region were developing complex social networks, exchanging resources and information, and adapting to their environment in innovative ways. This challenges the long-held view that modern human behavior and cognition emerged suddenly around 40,000-50,000 years ago, and instead suggests that these developments occurred much earlier, in groups that predated our own species.\n\nThe discoveries also highlight the importance of climate change in driving human innovation and adaptation. The Olorgesailie Basin was once a floodplain, but it became a vast arid grassland around 800,000 years ago, making life difficult for early humans. The team suggests that human populations adapted technologically and culturally to this new environment, developing new tools and social networks to cope with the challenges.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior. They suggest that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern never actually occurred, and that complex behaviors and innovations arose gradually over time, in multiple groups of hominins. The relationship between complex behaviors and hominin species from 500,000 years to 160,000 years ago remains to be understood, but the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide a new perspective on the evolution of human culture and cognition.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

He had previously undergone several operations and was fitted with a hearing aid, which allowed him to hear 90% of sounds. However, he still struggled with low self-esteem due to his appearance. His parents, David and Louise Sorkin, had always supported Kieran's desire for the surgery, which they saw as a way to boost his confidence and improve his quality of life.\n\nThe surgery has been hailed as a success, with Kieran's parents describing him as \"on cloud nine\" after the procedure. Kieran himself was thrilled with the result, exclaiming \"Wow!\" when he saw his new ears for the first time. The surgery is not only cosmetic, but also has significant psychological benefits, with Kieran's confidence expected to improve exponentially.\n\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital performs around 40 of these operations each year, although most are to create one missing ear. The hospital is also working with the University College London Institute for Child Health to develop a new method of creating ears using stem cells from a child's own fat tissue. This approach is expected to be less invasive and could revolutionize the field of reconstructive surgery.\n\nKieran will require a second operation in six months to refine the shape of his ears, but his parents are optimistic about the future. As Kieran's father, David Sorkin, said, \"If you can improve a young person's confidence, you can alter their whole trajectory in life.\"", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less. Born deaf with no ears, Kieran was able to hear because of an implanted hearing aid, but he still wanted ears. \"I want people to stop asking me questions,\" he told the BBC. \"I'd like just to look like my friends. I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

The panda, which had been chased by other villagers, bit Guan's leg, causing severe injuries that required eight surgeries over the past year.\n\nGuan's injuries were so severe that his leg may require amputation, prompting him to sue local government officials and the Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, which is home to over 100 wild pandas. After negotiations, the forestry bureau, the Longnan city government, and the reserve management agreed to pay Guan 520,000 yuan (approximately $83,000) in compensation.\n\nThis incident serves as a reminder that wild pandas, despite their lovable appearance, are members of the bear family and possess a fearsome bite.

The raids, which took place in August 2011, are the second of their kind, following a similar incident in 2009 when agents seized a shipment of ebony from Madagascar.\n\nThe Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law amended in 2008 to include plants, is at the center of the controversy. The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, despite being aware of the risks involved. Gibson, however, denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe case has sparked concerns among guitar builders and dealers, who fear that the Lacey Act is burdensome and retroactive. Attorney Ronald Bienstock warns that the law may require owners to prove the provenance of wood acquired decades ago, while Nashville's George Gruhn, a top dealer of old guitars, has nearly eliminated his business that deals with overseas buyers due to the uncertainty.\n\nThe EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the Lacey Act, stating that its intent is to reduce illegal logging and send a signal to the markets that responsible sourcing of wood is necessary.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated.

The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was approximately a mile deep in some areas and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding, published by NASA scientists, challenges the previous understanding of Mars as a planet with only occasional and short-lived water presence.\n\nThe research team used infrared telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere and analyze the isotopic composition of water molecules. They found that the water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, indicating that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past. By calculating the concentration of deuterium, the scientists estimated that the ancient ocean would have covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters, but it likely pooled into a deeper ocean in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the Red Planet. The longer water persisted on Mars, the more likely it is that it provided a habitable environment for life to originate or proliferate. While it is still unclear whether life existed on Mars, the evidence suggests that the planet was once warm and wet, making it a more promising place for life to have gained a foothold.\n\nThe study also found that the ordinary hydrogen in Martian water has been leaking into space over time, leading to a higher proportion of deuterium in the planet's water. This process, combined with the analysis of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, allowed the scientists to estimate the amount of water that once existed on the planet. The results suggest that the ancient ocean would have been at least 450 feet (137 meters) deep if it had covered the entire planet evenly.\n\nWhile the exact amount of water on ancient Mars is still a topic of debate, the evidence continues to mount that the planet was once much wetter and warmer than it is today. This, combined with increasing signs of a hospitable chemical environment, strengthens the notion that life might have once existed on Mars. The search for life on the Red Planet will continue, with NASA's Exomars rover set to launch in 2018 to search for chemical signatures of life beneath the Martian soil.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The movie's plot is described as ridiculous and absurd, with a lack of truth and no real revelation of the secret underworld it claims to expose. However, the film's charm lies in its audacity and the performances of its leads.\n\nThe casting of the film was a highly publicized process, with several A-list actors considered for the lead roles before Will Smith and Margot Robbie were ultimately chosen. The film's directors, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, aimed to create a movie that captures the effortless allure of a classic Hitchcock film, and they succeeded in bringing out the best in Will Smith, who plays the role of Nicky Spurgeon, a con man with confidence and charm.\n\nThe film's success can be attributed to its ability to balance humor and drama, with a dash of romance and wit. Margot Robbie, who plays the role of Jess Barrett, brings a modern twist to the classic \"dapper-con\" genre, and her chemistry with Will Smith is undeniable. The film's R-rating allows for some raunchy humor, which adds to its playful and lighthearted tone.\n\nWill Smith's performance in the film is notable, as he brings his signature charm and charisma to the role of Nicky Spurgeon. His ability to persuade anyone of anything is a key aspect of his character, and it's a skill he's honed throughout his career, from his early days as a rapper to his breakout role in \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\" The film's success is a testament to Smith's enduring charm and his ability to adapt to different roles and genres.\n\nOverall, \"Focus\" is a fun and entertaining film that delivers on its promise of a lighthearted, playful caper.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has dismissed appeals from both companies, sending the case back to the EU's trademark office for further review.\n\nThe dispute began in 2002 when Nestlé applied for a trademark for the shape of the four-fingered wafer bar, which was granted in 2006. However, Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury, objected to the decision, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be trademarked. The case has been ongoing for over a decade, with various appeals and court rulings.\n\nThe ECJ's latest decision means that the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must review its 2012 decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark on the shape of the KitKat. While the ruling does not necessarily mean that the trademark will be cancelled, it does leave open the possibility that the EUIPO may take into account new evidence that the shape is distinctive to people in more countries.\n\nThe case has significant implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The dispute has also been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has featured in the UK's Brexit debate, with some arguing that EU courts have failed to defend a beloved British treat.\n\nThe ruling also highlights the complexities of trademark law, particularly when it comes to shapes and designs. While Nestlé has argued that the shape of the KitKat is distinctive and should be trademarked, Mondelez has argued that it is not unique enough to be protected.\n\nThe case is not the only example of a trademark dispute involving chocolate companies. In 2006, Swiss chocolatier Lindt lost a trademark case over its Easter bunnies with a red ribbon, and in 2015, Cadbury lost a trademark battle over its purple color. The Toblerone brand, also owned by Mondelez, has successfully trademarked its distinctive triangular shape.\n\nThe outcome of the KitKat case is still uncertain, but it is likely to have significant implications for the chocolate industry and trademark law in the EU.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex, may not have roared like they do in movies, but instead made sounds similar to those of birds. According to researchers, the T. rex's roar, as depicted in films like \"Jurassic Park,\" is a fictional creation of sound designers, who used a combination of animal sounds, including baby elephant cries, tiger chuffs, and alligator gargles, to create the iconic sound.\n\nIn reality, scientists believe that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to those of birds, such as the cooing of a dove or the mumble of an ostrich. This is based on a study that analyzed the vocalizations of modern birds and found that many species, particularly those with larger body sizes, use a type of vocalization called closed-mouth vocalization. This type of vocalization involves pushing air into an esophageal pouch rather than exhaling through the open beak, resulting in low-frequency sounds.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, found that closed-mouth vocalization has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, and would have co-occurred with open-mouthed vocalizations.\n\nGary Rydstrom, a sound designer who worked on the original \"Jurassic Park\" film, revealed in an interview that he used a variety of animal sounds to create the dinosaurs' vocalizations, including a tortoise, a horse, a goose, and even his own dog, Buster. Rydstrom's creative approach to sound design has become legendary, and his use of unusual animal sounds has added to the iconic status of the film.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and communication. While we may never know exactly what dinosaurs sounded like, the research suggests that they may have made sounds that were more bird-like than mammalian. This challenges the traditional image of dinosaurs as roaring, ferocious creatures and offers a more nuanced view of these fascinating animals.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, noted that the demonstration of closed-mouth behavior evolving many times suggests that it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays. This has significant implications for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and communication, and highlights the importance of studying the vocalizations of modern birds to gain insights into the sounds of their dinosaur ancestors.\n\nThe research team plans to continue their study by integrating information from fossils,", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

Most of these prisoners were sentenced for crimes that were not as high-profile as Tsarnaev's, such as murders committed on federal land or gun crimes that crossed state lines.

Despite extensive searches, the plane's fate remains unknown. However, statisticians and experts are using Bayesian statistics, a mathematical technique developed by 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, to help locate the missing plane.\n\n**Bayesian Statistics: A Powerful Tool**\n\nBayesian statistics is a method of analyzing data and making predictions based on probability. It allows experts to update their estimates of the probability of finding the plane in any given location, taking into account new information and evidence. This approach has been used successfully in previous searches, including the location of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009.\n\n**The Air France Flight 447 Search**\n\nIn 2009, Air France Flight 447 disappeared while flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. Despite finding debris, the plane's wreckage was not located until 2011, two years later. Statisticians from Metron Inc. were called in to help locate the plane. Led by Colleen Keller, they used Bayesian statistics to analyze the data and create a probability map of the search area. The team's initial search area was too large, but after re-examining their assumptions, they found the plane's wreckage.\n\n**The Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Search**\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is more complex due to the new evidence of a deliberate act causing the disappearance. Bayesian statisticians are being used to update the probability of finding the plane in different locations. However, the search area is vast, and the currents in the Indian Ocean are unpredictable, making it a challenging task.\n\n**Challenges and Limitations**\n\nWhile Bayesian statistics has been successful in previous searches, it is not a guarantee of success. The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is complicated by the lack of data and the unpredictable currents in the Indian Ocean. Even if debris is found, it may not necessarily lead to the location of the plane's wreckage.\n\n**Expert Opinions**\n\nColleen Keller, the lead statistician on the Air France Flight 447 search, is skeptical about finding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. She believes that if no breakthroughs are made, the plane may be at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and never found. Other experts, such as Tony O'Hagan, argue that Bayesian statistics is the perfect tool for adapting to changing information and updating probability estimates", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time.

Huang, an Apple engineer, died in the accident. The vehicle was on Autopilot mode with adaptive cruise control set to minimum at the time of the collision.\n\nAccording to Tesla, the crash was severe due to the condition of the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier designed to reduce impact into a concrete lane divider. The barrier had been crushed in a prior accident 11 days before Huang's fatal crash and had not been replaced. Tesla stated that this level of damage to a Model X has never been seen in any other crash.\n\nHuang's family reported that he had complained to the dealership about the Autopilot system veering towards the same barrier on multiple occasions, with the issue occurring 7-10 times. The family took the vehicle to the dealership, but the issue could not be replicated.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the accident, and Tesla has released a statement regarding the incident. The company emphasized that Autopilot does not prevent all accidents but makes them less likely to occur, citing data that shows Tesla vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident.\n\nTesla also pointed out that the safety level of autonomous cars is expected to be 10 times safer than non-autonomous cars, and that the company's data shows that Autopilot has improved system reliability. However, the company acknowledged that the consequences of the public not using Autopilot due to an inaccurate belief that it is less safe would be severe, potentially saving 900,000 lives per year if the current safety level of Tesla vehicles were applied globally.\n\nThe incident has raised concerns about the safety of Autopilot and autonomous vehicles, following a similar incident in Arizona where a woman was killed by an Uber autonomous vehicle.

Williams' filmography spanned a wide range of genres, from prestige projects like \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" and \"Dead Poets Society\" to family-friendly films like \"Hook,\" \"Aladdin,\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" He was known for his generosity and willingness to take on roles that catered to children, often burying his recognizable face and body under makeup and prosthetics to create memorable characters.\n\nWilliams' stand-up comedy career was marked by his incredible energy and improvisational skills, which earned him a reputation as a genius in the comedy world. A freelance journalist who met Williams in 1978 recalled his first encounter with the comedian at the Comedy Store, where he performed a dazzling routine that left a lasting impression. Williams' rise to fame was swift, and he soon became a household name, but he seemed to be unprepared for the attention, insisting that he wouldn't be affected by it.\n\nThroughout his career, Williams took on a wide range of roles, from comedy to drama, often playing characters that seemed out of character with his stand-up persona but fit right in. He won four Oscar nominations and finally took home the award for his performance in \"Good Will Hunting\" in 1997. Despite his success, Williams struggled with the pressures of fame and the mid-budget adult drama market's decline, which led to a shift in his career focus.\n\nWilliams' death was met with shock and sadness, with officials initially reporting asphyxia from an apparent suicide as the cause of death.

This event is a combination of a blue moon, a supermoon, and a total lunar eclipse, making it a unique and spectacular sight.\n\n**What is a Blue Moon?**\nA blue moon occurs when there are two full moons in a single month, which happens approximately every 2.7 years. The second full moon in a month is called a blue moon.\n\n**What is a Supermoon?**\nA supermoon is a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear 14% larger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon.\n\n**What is a Total Lunar Eclipse?**\nA total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's light from reaching the moon. This causes the moon to darken and take on a reddish hue, earning it the nickname \"blood moon.\"\n\n**When and Where to See the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Eclipse**\nThe total lunar eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, and will be visible in the evening sky for those in the eastern hemisphere. The eclipse will begin at 11:48am UTC and reach its maximum at 1:30pm UTC.\n\n**How to See the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Eclipse**\nThe best time to see the supermoon is right after moonrise and before sunrise, when the moon is sitting on the horizon. It will appear its biggest and brightest due to the \"moon illusion\" effect. If it's cloudy or too cold to go outside, you can watch the event live on the Virtual Telescope project's livestream.\n\n**Photographing the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Eclipse**\nTo take a picture of the supermoon or lunar eclipse, use a smartphone or DSLR camera and adjust the exposure slider to get the right balance of light. Use the daylight white balance to adjust for the sunlight reflected off the moon. To get an original shot, put the moon in context with a local landmark.\n\n**No Special Glasses Needed**\nUnlike solar eclipses, the supermoon and lunar eclipse are safe to view with the naked eye, so there's no need for special glasses.\n\nThis rare celestial event is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity", "answers": ["Look up at the sky on Jan. 31 and you may witness a sight unseen for 150 years.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

The elections, which began in November, are the first since Mubarak's departure in February 2011.\n\n**Islamist Groups Expected to Consolidate Gains**\n\nIslamist groups, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, are expected to consolidate their gains in the final round of voting. The Brotherhood has already taken the lead in the first two rounds, winning around 40% of the seats allocated by party voting. The party's leader, Essam el-Erian, has stated that while a clear majority is possible, it would be difficult to achieve.\n\n**Prosecutors Accuse Mubarak of \"Tyrannical Rule\"**\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors in Mubarak's trial accused the ousted leader of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensure his son, Gamal, would succeed him. The trial, which resumed on January 2, 2012, is expected to last for three days, with the prosecution presenting its case against Mubarak and 10 other defendants, including his two sons and security chief.\n\n**Mubarak's Trial and the Military's Role**\n\nMubarak faces charges of complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the crackdown on the popular uprising that forced him out of office in February 2011. The trial has been marred by procedural delays, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding judge be removed. The military, which has been in power since Mubarak's ouster, has stated that it will not cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June.\n\n**Economic Growth Slows**\n\nThe country's economic growth has slowed due to the unrest, with foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% to $20.2 billion in the first 11 months of 2011. The benchmark EGX 30 stock index lost 49% last year, making it the third-worst performer among world markets tracked by Bloomberg.\n\n**Protesters Prepare for Anniversary of Mubarak's Ouster**\n\nProtesters are preparing to take to the streets on January 25 to mark the anniversary of the mass rallies that drove Mubarak from power. The anniversary comes as the country continues to gr", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

According to police, Altahan was driving westbound on Route 4 when her GPS device suddenly directed her to turn around, as she had passed her intended destination. In a swift reaction, Altahan left the road, and her car ended up dangling from the telephone pole's support wire.\n\nFortunately, neither Altahan nor her passenger was injured in the incident. Witnesses, including a person at a nearby miniature golf course, reported seeing the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended from the pole. The Rutland City Fire Department and State Police responded to the scene, with State Police releasing a statement confirming the incident.\n\nThis unusual accident serves as a reminder of the importance of carefully following GPS directions and not reacting impulsively to sudden changes in navigation.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP.

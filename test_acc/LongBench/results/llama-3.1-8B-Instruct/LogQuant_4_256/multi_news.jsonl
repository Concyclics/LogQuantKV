{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs: A Growing Concern**\n\nRecent studies have revealed a disturbing link between cigarette smoke and the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to the studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which are essential for fighting off bacterial infections. The smoke-exposed bacteria also become better at invading human cells and can cause more severe infections, including pneumonia. In fact, the study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was able to kill more mice in lab cultures than those not exposed to smoke.\n\nThe researchers believe that cigarette smoke acts as an alarm to MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses and become more resistant to the immune system. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or surgical sites, and is often resistant to antibiotics.\n\nThe study also found that the increased resistance to the immune system continued for 24 hours after exposure to cigarette smoke, suggesting that it could be inherited. This is a significant concern, as MRSA can divide rapidly, generating nearly 17 million descendents in just 12 hours.\n\nIn contrast, e-cigarette vapor was found to have a lesser effect on MRSA, making it only slightly more aggressive but not as much as cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke makes the pathogen tougher, rather than just harming the smoker.\n\nThe findings of these studies highlight the importance of quitting smoking to prevent the spread of superbugs like MRSA.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning about the condition, which affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause severe symptoms such as limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech.\n\nThe exact cause of AFM is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections, including enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Enteroviruses are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children, but when they get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain.\n\nSymptoms of AFM can appear suddenly, often after a respiratory or febrile illness, and can progress rapidly, leaving children with severe and long-lasting paralysis. In some cases, patients have been left with permanent weakness or disability.\n\nThe CDC is urging parents and caregivers to take precautions to prevent the spread of AFM, including washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick people, and cleaning surfaces with a disinfectant. While there is no specific treatment for AFM, researchers are studying the condition and exploring potential therapies, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Prozac.\n\nThe outbreak of AFM in 2014, which affected 120 children, was linked to an outbreak of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), but the CDC did not detect the virus in the AFM specimens collected that year. This year, some doctors are warning that the current rise in AFM cases could be linked to a similar outbreak of EV-D68.\n\nThe CDC is working with state and local health departments to investigate the cases and identify the cause of the condition. In the meantime, parents and caregivers are advised to be vigilant and take precautions to prevent the spread of AFM.\n\n**Key Statistics:**\n\n* 50 confirmed cases of AFM reported across 24 states as of August 2016\n* 120 cases reported in 2014, mostly in children under 21\n* Median age of patients is 7.6 years\n* 54% of patients are males\n*", "answers": ["At first, it seemed like 4-year-old Laura Carson was suffering from a simple headache.

They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The study concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the Shroud of Turin is likely a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the crucifixion.

The situation has sparked concerns across the region, with neighboring countries and the international community calling for a swift resolution.\n\n**Background: The Coup**\n\nOn March 22, a group of disgruntled soldiers, led by Captain Amadou Haya Sanogo, overthrew President Amadou Toumani Touré, who had been in power for over two decades. The coup was justified as a response to the government's mishandling of an insurgency in the north by Tuareg rebels. However, the coup has had the opposite effect, with the rebels seizing control of the northern half of the country, including the key towns of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu.\n\n**The Tuareg Rebellion**\n\nThe Tuareg rebels, who are primarily from the nomadic Tuareg people, are seeking independence for the northern region, which they call Azawad. The rebels are divided into two groups: the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which wants independence, and Ansar Dine, which is linked to al-Qaeda and wants to impose Sharia law. The rebels have taken advantage of the power vacuum in Bamako, the capital, and have made rapid advances in the north.\n\n**Regional Response**\n\nWest African leaders, led by Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, have formed a diplomatic emergency committee to try and resolve the crisis. The committee has threatened the junta with sanctions if they do not relinquish power. However, the regional leaders are not blameless, with some, like Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaoré, facing mutinies in their own countries.\n\n**International Concerns**\n\nThe international community is also concerned about the situation in Mali. The United Nations has warned that the fighting could damage the World Heritage Site of Timbuktu, a city known for its unique mud and wood architecture.

The UN Security Council is due to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis.\n\n**Economic Impact**\n\nThe sanctions imposed by Mali's neighbors, including a border closure and a freeze on the country's bank account, are expected to have a significant impact on the country's economy.

The charity was established in 2005 after Rowling was moved by a photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. This image sparked her to take action, and she began writing letters to influential people to bring attention to the issue.\n\nAccording to Lumos, 8 million children are separated from their families worldwide, often due to poverty, disability, or discrimination. However, the majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but lack the resources or support to do so. Institutionalization can cause irreparable harm to children, including malnutrition, developmental delays, and psychological trauma.\n\nLumos estimates that with investment in inclusive education and health, support for vulnerable families, and alternative care options such as fostering and adoption, the practice of institutionalization can be eradicated globally. The charity has already seen success in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has decreased significantly.\n\nIn Moldova, there has been a 70% reduction in the number of children in institutions since Lumos began working there in 2007. In the Czech Republic, the number of children being admitted to institutions has dropped by 16% nationally, while in Lumos's demonstration area, admissions have fallen by 75%. In Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has decreased by 54%, and the number of foster carers has increased by 440%.\n\nThe EU, US, and Global Alliance for Children have made commitments to support this effort, and Lumos is calling on international donors to prioritize funding for inclusive education and health, as well as family-based care alternatives.

The film features a talented cast, including Anthony Hopkins and Emily Blunt, but Del Toro's performance has been criticized for being too serious and lacking the emotional connection with the character.\n\nThe film's special effects have also been a point of contention, with some critics feeling that they are dated and overused. The movie's attempt to blend traditional horror elements with modern special effects has resulted in a film that feels like a hybrid of different styles, but ultimately fails to deliver.\n\nIn contrast to the remake, the original 1941 film starring Lon Chaney Jr. has been praised for its atmospheric and suspenseful storytelling, and its influence can still be seen in modern horror films.

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The discovery was announced in a study published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nCaihong juji, meaning \"rainbow with a big crest\" in Mandarin, is a crow-sized, bird-like dinosaur with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds. The dinosaur's feathers were found to be iridescent, with microscopic structures called melanosomes that were responsible for pigmentation. The melanosomes were detected using powerful microscopes and were found to be similar to those of hummingbirds with iridescent feathers.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji suggests a more colorful Jurassic world than previously imagined, with the dinosaur's plumage likely used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The dinosaur's body was covered in feathers, with long, linear feathers on its neck and short, sinuous feathers on its head and chest. The tail feathers were particularly striking, with large, pennaceous feathers that formed a frond-shaped tail.\n\nThe study also found that Caihong juji had a unique combination of bird-like and reptilian characteristics, with a bird-like body and a reptilian skull. The dinosaur's forelimbs were proportionally short, but its hindlimbs were highly elongated, suggesting that it may have glided from tree to tree.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of birds and the development of feathers. The dinosaur's iridescent feathers are similar to those of modern hummingbirds, and its asymmetrical tail feathers are a key adaptation for flight. The study suggests that Caihong juji may have used its feathers for display purposes, but its exact behavior and social structure remain a mystery.\n\nThe fossil of Caihong juji was discovered by a local farmer in northeastern China's Hebei Province and was later acquired by the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning. The study was led by paleontologist Dongyu Hu and involved a team of researchers from China and the United States.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji is a significant addition to our understanding of the diversity of dinosaurs and the evolution of feathers.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

However, critics argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families, and has driven sales outside city limits.\n\nBusinesses, such as Costco, have seen a significant decline in sales of sugary drinks, with a case of Gatorade increasing from $15.99 to $26.33, a 64% increase. Retailers have responded by posting signs directing customers to locations outside the city limits where they can buy the products without the tax. This has led to a loss of revenue for the city, with some businesses reporting a 34% decline in sales.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, exempting sugary drinks with milk as a primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages, and not applying to food stamp purchases. The tax has been compared to the failed Cook County, Illinois, soda tax, which was repealed after just two months due to public outcry.\n\nA bill to bring the tax statewide has been re-introduced in Washington state, but local businesses are concerned about the potential impact on their sales. Some residents, however, support the tax, citing its potential to discourage people from drinking sugary drinks and promote public health.\n\nThe tax has been criticized for its lack of effectiveness in achieving its intended goals, with some arguing that it is a form of \"nanny statism\" that oversteps the role of government.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Myrna Arias, who worked for Intermex from February to May 2014, claims that her boss, John Stubits, required her to install the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone, which tracked her every move, including her driving speed and routes taken.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours, likening it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet. Stubits allegedly admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged about knowing her driving speed at specific moments. Arias complained to Stubits that this was an invasion of her privacy, but he told her to tolerate the intrusion because Intermex was paying her more than her previous employer.\n\nArias' attorney, Gail Glick, stated that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a legitimate business interest, but if an employee cannot stop it, it is a violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy. Glick also claimed that Intermex went \"above and beyond a normal wrongful termination\" by interfering with Arias' ability to earn a livelihood.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges invasion of privacy, retaliation, unfair business practices, and other claims, seeking damages in excess of $500,000. Arias' complaint also alleges that Intermex's president and CEO, Robert Lisy, made a phone call to her previous employer, NetSpend, which led to her termination from that job as well.\n\nThe Xora app, now known as ClickSoftware Solution, is a web-based management application that enables office staff to track employees' locations, dispatch daily worker orders, and analyze driving routes and times.

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark, found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with ADHD and similar disorders.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy were at a higher risk of having children with ADHD-like behaviors. The study suggests that acetaminophen may interfere with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development, although the researchers emphasize that the findings do not show a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThe study's authors, led by Dr. Beate Ritz, recommend that pregnant women avoid taking acetaminophen frequently until more studies have been done. However, they also note that the study does not suggest that pregnant women should never take acetaminophen, and that the risk-benefit ratio should be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOther experts, such as Dr. Jeffrey Chapa, head of maternal-fetal medicine at Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital, suggest that pregnant women should consider non-pharmacological ways to deal with pain, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture.

Here are five notable examples:\n\n1. **Anthony Scaramucci**: The former White House Communications Director's tenure was the shortest in history, lasting just two weeks. His tumultuous time in the Trump administration was marked by protocol breaches, conflicting statements, and a profanity-laced interview. His wife even filed for divorce during his brief stint.\n\n2. **Chris Christie**: The former Governor of New Jersey and 2016 presidential contender has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the state's history. His reputation was damaged by the Bridgegate scandal, and his attempts to curry favor with Donald Trump ultimately fell flat. His decision to lounge on a state-owned beach during a government shutdown only added to his unpopularity.\n\n3. **James Comey**: The former FBI Director was a polarizing figure during the 2016 presidential election, with some attributing Trump's victory to his investigation of Hillary Clinton. However, Trump abruptly fired Comey in May 2017, citing conflicting justifications. Comey's tenure was marked by controversy, including his public criticism of Clinton's email server and his decision to announce an investigation just days before the election.\n\n4. **Mark Fields**: The former CEO of Ford Motor Company was shown the door in 2017 after failing to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Despite investing in electric and autonomous vehicle technology, Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure. His attempts to woo shareholders by reducing the global workforce were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n5. **Tiger Woods**: The golf superstar has been embroiled in controversy since reports of his infidelity surfaced in 2009. His latest scandal involved a DUI arrest, which revealed a combination of prescription medications in his system.

Senate Democrats have vowed to reject any changes to the health law, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto such a bill.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

According to reports, Neiman Marcus's computer network was penetrated by hackers as far back as July, with the breach not being fully contained until January 1. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, stating that some customers' payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at their stores. Neiman Marcus has apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner, citing a need to confirm evidence before making a public announcement.\n\nIn a similar incident, Target Corp. suffered a massive data breach that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts, as well as the personal information of 70 million people. A 17-page report from computer firm iSight provides new insight into the hack, revealing that the malware used was a type of software that was placed in the store's point-of-sale systems. The report notes that the malware was highly sophisticated and was able to evade detection by network controls and common forensic tactics.\n\nThe report also suggests that the malware was created in regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist, including Eastern Europe and Brazil. The tactic used by the hackers was \"new to eCrime\" and involved getting the encrypted data in the authorization stage while it was in the memory of the POS system, unencrypted.\n\nA separate report prepared by federal and private investigators suggests that the Target breach was part of a broader and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers.

In Kenya, a 13-year-old male lion named Mohawk, also known as the \"ladies lion,\" was shot dead by wildlife rangers after it strayed from Nairobi National Park and attacked a man in the town of Isinya. The lion had been surrounded by a crowd, which agitated it, prompting the rangers to take action as a last resort.\n\nMohawk was a beloved attraction in the park, known for his distinctive black mane and his habit of roaming freely among tourists. The incident sparked an outcry among Kenyans, with many questioning why the rangers did not tranquilize the lion instead of killing it. The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said that the lion was a threat to public safety and that the decision to kill it was taken as a last resort.\n\nThe incident is not an isolated one, as several lions have escaped from Nairobi National Park in recent weeks, with most being recaptured alive. However, the increasing number of escapes has been attributed to habitat loss and the encroachment of the park by development projects. The government's decision to build a highway through a section of the park has also been cited as a contributing factor.\n\nIn a separate incident in South Africa, a 3-year-old male lion named Sylvester escaped from Karoo National Park and is currently being hunted by wildlife officials. The lion, which has a satellite tracking collar, has been on the loose for several days and has been a threat to humans and livestock. While officials have vowed to put it down once captured, conservationists have launched a campaign to save the lion, with a Twitter hashtag #SaveSylvester and an online petition.\n\nThe incidents highlight the challenges faced by wildlife officials in balancing the need to protect people and conserve lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflict with livestock herders. The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the African lion a \"vulnerable\" species, with its population having declined by 50% in the past 20 years.\n\nThe incidents also raise questions about the effectiveness of wildlife management and the need for more sustainable solutions to address the conflict between humans and wildlife.

The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it.

The data brokers, which include companies such as Acxiom, Experian, and Equifax, collect and sell consumer information to marketers, who use it to target shoppers based on their income, clothing size, and other personal characteristics.\n\nThe report found that some data brokers are selling lists of consumers with specific health conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and depression, as well as lists of people who have purchased certain medications. Equifax, one of the companies that cooperated with the committee, revealed that it has data on consumers' purchasing habits, including whether they buy soft drinks or shampoo products, and even how many whiskey drinks they consume in a month.\n\nThe World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization, uncovered these lists while investigating how data brokers collect and sell consumer information. The group's executive director, Pam Dixon, testified before Congress that the existence of these lists highlights the need for increased government regulations to protect consumer privacy. Dixon noted that data brokers are required by federal law to maintain the privacy of consumer data only if it is used for credit, employment, insurance, or housing, but that medical information collected elsewhere, such as from the purchase of over-the-counter drugs, is fair game.\n\nThe lists of sensitive information could put people in harm's way, such as the list of over 30,000 police officers' home addresses, which could put the lives of the officers and their families in danger. The lists of seniors with dementia could also open them up to predatory financial offers.\n\nThe Direct Marketing Association, which represents the data brokerage industry, acknowledged that some lists may be used to disparage certain groups, but argued that such lists represent a \"tiny minority\" of marketing products. However, many data brokers have unclear or no opt-out procedures, and most consumers have no idea they are on the lists in the first place.\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee chairman, John \"Jay\" Rockefeller, criticized the data brokers for resisting oversight and vowed to continue pushing for information on how they collect and sell consumer data.

It is estimated to be 5-10 times the mass of Earth and has a highly elliptical orbit that takes 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine was made by a team of researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006. Brown and his colleague, Konstantin Batygin, used mathematical and computer modeling to infer the existence of the planet, which they believe is responsible for the unusual motion of small, icy bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system.\n\nThe researchers have not directly observed the planet, but they are confident that it exists based on the gravitational influence it has on the smaller objects. They estimate that the planet is about two to four times the diameter of Earth and is likely an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Mike Brown argues that Pluto's demotion was necessary for the good of science and that it is now an interesting member of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.\n\nBrown has stated that he has no regrets about his role in Pluto's demotion and believes that the controversy will eventually die down as people become more comfortable with the idea of Pluto not being a planet. He hopes that the New Horizons mission to Pluto will help to shift the focus away from the debate and towards the study of the Kuiper Belt.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on at least two continents searching for the object. The researchers believe that it may be detectable with the most powerful telescopes on the planet, but it will require a precise pointing of the telescope to locate it. If discovered, Planet Nine would be the ninth planet in our solar system, and its existence would reconfigure our understanding of the solar system's structure and evolution.", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over a period of five years, found that those who experienced the largest fluctuations in body weight had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased. This can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, emphasized the importance of maintaining weight loss over time. \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off,\" he said. \"Many people are motivated to lose weight, but then they feel they can take it easy. This information can be used as motivation to keep the weight off.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. Researchers have found that people with coronary heart disease who experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death compared to those who experienced little change in body weight.\n\nThe study's results suggest that weight fluctuation may be a concern for people with coronary heart disease, and that maintaining a stable weight may be crucial for reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death. Dr. Bangalore and his team recommend further investigation into the causes of weight fluctuation and how to help Americans keep weight off.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Yo-yo dieting may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death in people with coronary artery disease.\n* The largest weight fluctuations were associated with a 78% higher risk of new", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

The issue occurred when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The valve, which regulates the flow of ammonia coolant, reached a pre-set temperature limit, causing the shutdown.\n\nAccording to NASA, the crew was never in any danger, and the situation is not a life-threatening emergency.

The space station is scheduled to be maintained through 2020, with the possibility of extending its operating life.\n\nThe external cooling loops are critical systems that circulate ammonia outside the station to keep equipment cool.

This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults.\n\nAccording to the study, which analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011, nearly 15% of patients were under 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment.\n\nResearchers found that younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) compared to older patients. Despite having more advanced disease, younger patients had higher five-year survival rates, with 95.1% surviving localized disease, 76% surviving regional disease, and 21.3% surviving distant disease.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. She noted that the medical community should be aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool.\n\nExperts agree that the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unclear, but potential contributing factors may include environmental factors, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, suggested that the increase may be due to an environmental effect that is contributing to the rise in colon cancer.\n\nThe study's findings raise questions about whether screening guidelines for colon cancer should be altered to start at an earlier age. While some experts argue that the risk is still low, others suggest that the medical community needs to prepare for the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors who will require long-term support.\n\nUltimately, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in detecting colorectal cancer in younger adults, as well as a reevaluation of current screening guidelines to ensure that younger individuals are not being diagnosed with advanced-stage disease.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, has revealed a treasure trove of artefacts and bones, including the earliest known evidence of human interaction with megafauna.\n\n**The Discovery**\n\nThe site was discovered by chance when archaeologist Giles Hamm and local elder Clifford Coulthard were surveying the area. Hamm, a consultant archaeologist and doctoral student at La Trobe University, said that the discovery was made when Coulthard needed to use the restroom and stumbled upon a rock shelter with a blackened roof, indicating human activity.\n\n**Significance of the Site**\n\nThe Warratyi rock shelter is significant because it shows that Aboriginal Australians settled the arid interior of the country around 49,000 years ago, 10,000 years earlier than previously thought. The site also contains the first reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum, a giant wombat-like species that is now extinct.\n\n**Artefacts and Fossils**\n\nThe excavations at the site have yielded over 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile. The artefacts include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre, and gypsum pigments, which suggest that early humans developed these technologies locally. The fossils include the remains of a giant bird and a Diprotodon, which were likely brought to the site by humans.\n\n**Dating the Site**\n\nThe site has been dated using optical dating of quartz grains, which suggests that the artefacts and fossils are between 49,000 and 46,000 years old. Radiocarbon dating of burnt eggshells has also confirmed that the site is at least 45,000 years old.\n\n**Impact on Our Understanding of Human History**\n\nThe discovery of the Warratyi rock shelter has significant implications for our understanding of human history in Australia. It challenges the idea that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world and suggests that they were able to adapt to the arid environment of the Australian interior.\n\n**Debate and Controversy**\n\nThe discovery has sparked debate among archaeologists, with some questioning the accuracy of the dating methods used.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "**Harnessing Energy from the Universe: A Quest for Advanced Civilizations**\n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has revived the concept of harnessing energy from distant stars to prevent the universe from expanding beyond reach. This idea, first proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, suggests that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies to secure energy before they become inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of the universe.\n\nAccording to Hooper, the presence of dark energy is causing space to expand at an alarming rate, and within 100 billion years, stars beyond our Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making them unobservable and inaccessible. To counter this, advanced civilizations would need to capture and harvest energy from stars before they become lost forever.\n\nHooper proposes the use of Dyson spheres, a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites that could hover around a star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to a nearby planet. This concept was first described by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\" and later by physicist Freeman Dyson in a 1960 scientific paper.\n\nDyson spheres would be made up of individual solar-collecting satellites, known as statites, which would balance against the pressure of light from the star to remain in place. A ring of statites would form a cloud around the star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe idea of harnessing energy from distant stars is not new, but Hooper's paper adds a new twist by suggesting that advanced civilizations would not only capture stars but also accelerate them back towards their home galaxy, making them visible as a result of the propulsion.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "Recent archaeological discoveries in East Africa have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have uncovered evidence of a significant shift in toolmaking and trading networks among early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This period marks the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, a time of great change and innovation in human history.\n\nThe discoveries, published in three papers in the journal Science, suggest that early humans in the region were responding to dramatic shifts in the climate, which led to unpredictable food sources and the need for greater mobility and resourcefulness. The researchers propose that this led to the development of smaller, more specialized tools, such as spearpoints and blades, which were made from obsidian and other exotic materials brought from distant locations.\n\nThe use of obsidian, a volcanic glass, is particularly significant, as it indicates a level of technological sophistication and the ability to transport and process raw materials over long distances. The team also found evidence of the extraction of pigments, including red and black rocks, which were likely used for symbolic purposes, such as painting or decorating tools.\n\nThese findings challenge the long-held view that modern human behaviors, such as symbolism, innovation, and art, emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago, and instead suggest that these traits were present much earlier, in groups that predated our own species. The discoveries also highlight the importance of social networks and the exchange of information and resources in the development of human culture.\n\nThe researchers propose that the transition to the Middle Stone Age was driven by long-term climate change, which led to the development of more complex and mobile societies. This is supported by the fact that the Olorgesailie Basin was a region of great geological instability, with frequent earthquakes and changes in the landscape.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior. They suggest that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern never actually occurred, and that complex behaviors and technological innovations were present in multiple human species across Africa, rather than being a unique characteristic of our own species.\n\nOverall, the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide a new perspective on the evolution of human culture and technology, and highlight the importance of social networks, innovation, and adaptation in the development of human societies.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The new ears were designed to match the shape of his mother's ears, which were used as a template. The surgery was a success, and Kieran was delighted with the result, exclaiming \"Wow!\" when he saw his new ears for the first time.\n\nThe surgery is a major operation, but it brings a significant improvement in quality of life for children with microtia. According to Bulstrode, it can alter a child's whole trajectory in life by improving their confidence and self-esteem. Kieran's parents, David and Louise, were overjoyed with the result, saying they couldn't have wished for a better outcome.\n\nThe surgery is not without its challenges, and Kieran will require a follow-up operation in six months to make his ears stand out from his scalp more. However, the long-term prospects for Kieran's new ears are promising, as they are made from cartilage and are expected to last.\n\nResearchers at the University College London Institute for Child Health are working on a new approach to ear reconstruction using stem cells from a child's own fat tissue. This method is expected to be less invasive than the current procedure and could revolutionize the field of reconstructive surgery in the future.\n\nFor now, Kieran is enjoying his new ears and the confidence boost that comes with it. He is looking forward to wearing sunglasses and earphones like his friends and fitting in with his peers. The surgery has given him a new lease on life, and he is grateful for the opportunity to look and feel more like everyone else.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less. Born deaf with no ears, Kieran was able to hear because of an implanted hearing aid, but he still wanted ears. \"I want people to stop asking me questions,\" he told the BBC. \"I'd like just to look like my friends. I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

However, the Nonhuman Rights Project plans to use this momentum to sway judges in other jurisdictions and file additional cases, including one involving a captive elephant. The organization aims to prove that animals like elephants, great apes, and whales and dolphins are autonomous beings deserving of bodily liberty.\n\nThe intersection of these two stories highlights the importance of habeas corpus as a bulwark against executive power and the erosion of fundamental rights.

Until now in the US, those who've used this legal tactic have been human. But a New York judge yesterday ruled that the writ may be used by two lab chimpanzees at Stony Brook University, Science magazine reports. NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

The raids, which took place in August 2011, are the second time Gibson has been targeted by the government, following a similar raid in 2009.\n\nThe Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law, was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, where there is a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood. However, Gibson denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Lacey Act has sparked debate in the guitar world, with some, like Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the law as a necessary measure to prevent illegal logging. Others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature, which could force guitar builders to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago.\n\nThe raids have also had a significant impact on the guitar industry, with dealers like George Gruhn of Nashville's George Gruhn Guitars warning of a \"nightmare\" scenario where owners are asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The law also covers the trade in vintage instruments, which has led to a decline in Gruhn's business.\n\nIn a separate development, the Internet Archive has been collecting data from Alexa Internet since 1996, adding it to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.

The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was approximately a mile deep in some areas and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding, published by NASA scientists, challenges the previous understanding of Mars as a planet with only occasional and rare flowing water.\n\nThe research team used infrared maps of the Martian atmosphere to analyze the isotopic composition of water molecules, which revealed a significant enrichment of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. This enrichment indicates that Mars lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times the amount currently locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The scientists estimate that the ancient ocean would have covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters, but it likely pooled into a deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the Red Planet. The longer water persists on a planetary body, the more likely it is to provide a habitable environment for life to originate or proliferate. The presence of an ocean would have provided a suitable environment for life to emerge, and the fact that Mars was warm and wet for a longer period than previously thought increases the chances of life existing on the planet.\n\nAstronomers have also used powerful telescopes to analyze the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, revealing that an ocean at least a mile deep covered a significant fraction of the Martian surface four billion years ago. The team calculated that the ocean would have reached a depth of about 450 feet (137 meters) if it had covered the entire planet evenly, but it likely formed an ocean in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe evidence continues to mount that Mars was once a wet and habitable planet, with increasing signs that the ancient chemical environment was hospitable to biology. While the possibility of life existing on Mars is still a topic of debate, the discovery of an ancient ocean and the presence of water on the planet increase the chances of finding life on the Red Planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, the film's charm lies in its audacity and the performances of its leads.\n\nThe casting of the film was a highly publicized process, with several A-list actors considered for the lead roles before Will Smith and Margot Robbie were ultimately chosen. The film's directors, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, aimed to create a movie that captures the effortless allure of a classic Hitchcock film, with a mix of old and new stars.\n\nWill Smith's performance in the film is notable, as he gets to play a charming and confident character, a departure from his usual macho-man roles.

The case revolves around the shape of the Kit Kat finger wafer, which Nestlé has been fighting to trademark in the European Union (EU) for over a decade.\n\nIn 2002, Nestlé applied for a trademark for the shape of the Kit Kat bar, which was granted by the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in 2006. However, Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury, challenged the decision, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be trademarked. The case has been ongoing since then, with various appeals and court rulings.\n\nThe ECJ's latest decision sends the case back to the EUIPO, which must review its 2012 decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark. The court found that Nestlé had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive, but also dismissed Mondelez's appeal against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016.\n\nThe outcome leaves open the possibility that the EUIPO could preserve protection for Kit Kat's shape, but only if new evidence is presented to show that the shape is distinctive to people in more countries. The brand name \"KitKat\" is not at issue in the case.\n\nThe dispute has significant implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The case has also been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has featured in Britain's Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat.\n\nThe saga has been ongoing for over 15 years, with various twists and turns. In 2015, the Daily Express newspaper headlined a story on an earlier ruling: \"End of the KitKat?\" It said an EU \"diktat\" might \"spell the end of\" the wafer bars as the \"market could now be flooded with copycat confectionery.\"\n\nThe case has also been mirrored by a dispute between the two multinationals in the British courts, where Nestlé objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.\n\nThe outcome of the case remains uncertain, but it is clear that the dispute has significant implications for the chocolate industry and the EU", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex, may not have roared like they are often depicted in movies and popular culture. According to researchers, the sounds made by dinosaurs were likely more similar to those of birds, with low, throaty whooshes of air, rather than the high-pitched screams often associated with them.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of modern birds and found that many species, particularly those with larger body sizes, use a type of vocalization called closed-mouth vocalization. This involves pushing air into an esophageal pouch rather than exhaling through the open beak, resulting in lower-pitched sounds. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur vocalizations. While we can't know for certain what dinosaurs sounded like, the researchers believe that some dinosaurs, particularly those with large body sizes, may have made closed-mouthed vocalizations, similar to those of modern birds. This could have been used for mating displays or territorial defense.\n\nIn contrast to the loud, roaring sounds often depicted in movies, the sounds made by dinosaurs may have been more subdued and low-pitched. According to Gary Rydstrom, a sound designer who worked on the movie Jurassic Park, the iconic T. rex roar was actually created by combining sounds from a baby elephant, a tiger, and an alligator. Rydstrom also used a variety of animal sounds, including those of tortoises, horses, and geese, to create the vocalizations of other dinosaurs in the movie.\n\nThe study's findings are based on an analysis of 208 bird species, which revealed that 52 use closed-mouth vocalization. The researchers also found that this behavior is more common in larger-bodied birds, such as doves and ostriches. The study's lead author, Tobias Riede, suggests that the association between body size and closed-mouth vocalization may be due to the physical properties of the vocal organ.\n\nThe study's results have significant implications for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and evolution. While we can't know for certain what dinosaurs sounded like, the study provides a new perspective on the vocalizations of these ancient creatures. Future research will continue to explore the sounds made by extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors, using a combination of fossil evidence, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

Despite extensive searches, the plane's fate remains unknown. However, statisticians and experts are using Bayesian statistics, a mathematical technique developed by 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, to help locate the plane.\n\n**Bayesian Statistics: A Powerful Tool**\n\nBayesian statistics is a method of analyzing data and making predictions based on probability. It allows experts to update their estimates of the probability of finding the plane in any given location, taking into account new information and evidence. This approach has been used successfully in previous searches, including the location of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009.\n\n**The Air France Flight 447 Search**\n\nIn 2009, Air France Flight 447 disappeared while flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. Despite finding debris, the plane's wreckage was not located until 2011, two years later. Statisticians from Metron Inc. were called in to help locate the plane. Using Bayesian statistics, they created a probability map of the search area, taking into account various theories about the crash, historical data from previous crashes, and the uncertainties of each piece of data. The team's analysis led to a much tighter search area, and eventually, the plane's wreckage was found.\n\n**The Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Search**\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been ongoing for years, with no breakthroughs yet. Statisticians from Metron Inc. are not involved in the current search, but they have offered their expertise to the Malaysian government. The search area is vast, and the investigators are struggling to know where to look. Bayesian statistics could help narrow down the search area, but it's a complex task.\n\n**Challenges and Limitations**\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is complicated by the fact that the plane's communication systems were shut off, and there is evidence of a deliberate diversion. This changes the probability of finding the plane in any given location. Additionally, the search area is vast, and the ocean currents are unpredictable, making it difficult to simulate the plane's movement.\n\n**Expert Opinions**\n\nColleen Keller, a senior analyst at Metron Inc., says that Bayesian statistics can help solve the mystery of the plane's disappearance. However, she also notes that it's very likely that the plane is at the bottom of the Indian", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time.

This event is even more special as it coincides with a \"Supermoon,\" where the moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon.\n\n**Visibility and Timing**\n\nThe total lunar eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, with the best viewing times in the evening sky. The eclipse will begin at 11:48am UTC and reach its maximum at 1:30pm UTC. For viewers in eastern North America, it will be necessary to wake up early to catch the partial eclipse.\n\n**Supermoon Trilogy**\n\nThis is the third supermoon in a row, with the first one occurring on December 3, 2017, and the second on New Year's Day, 2018.

Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

Mubarak faces charges of complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the crackdown on the popular uprising that forced him out of office.\n\n**Prosecutor Demands Harsh Penalty for Mubarak**\n\nIn a scathing critique of Mubarak's rule, Suleiman demanded that the former president be given the \"harshest penalty\" for his crimes. Mubarak's two sons, Alaa and Gamal, are also on trial, facing corruption charges. The trial is seen as a crucial test of the country's commitment to accountability and justice.\n\n**Economic Growth Slows**\n\nThe elections and Mubarak's trial take place amid growing economic concerns, with the country's growth slowing due to the unrest and lack of investment. Foreign-currency reserves have declined by 44% to $20.2 billion, and the benchmark EGX 30 stock index has lost 49% in value last year.\n\n**Military Rulers Face Opposition**\n\nThe new parliament is expected to take authority over the hiring and firing of a prime minister, which could lead to a confrontation with the military rulers. The Brotherhood has said it expects the parliament to take control, while the military has stated that it intends to retain authority.\n\n**Protest", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

In a swift reaction, Altahan left the road, and her car became lodged on a telephone pole's guy wire.\n\nFortunately, neither Altahan nor her passenger was injured in the incident. Witnesses, including a driver who happened to be passing by, reported that Altahan jumped out of the car as it was suspended from the pole.

In a letter written to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, Kalashnikov expressed his deep spiritual pain and guilt over the countless lives lost due to his invention. The letter, dated May 2012, was published by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, and reveals a man grappling with the moral implications of his creation.\n\nKalashnikov designed the AK-47 in 1947, inspired by his experiences in World War II, where he was wounded fighting for the Red Army. The rifle's simplicity, reliability, and affordability made it a widely used and manufactured weapon, with over 100 million sold worldwide. However, its use by terrorists, child soldiers, and other malicious actors has led to widespread suffering and death.\n\nIn his letter, Kalashnikov questioned whether he was responsible for the lives lost, despite his intention to design the rifle to defend his country.

{"pred": "**Cigarette Smoke Fuels the Growth of Superbugs: A Growing Concern**\n\nRecent studies have revealed a disturbing link between cigarette smoke and the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. This increased resistance allows the bacteria to repel common forms of immune responses, making it more difficult to treat. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be inherited.\n\nIn lab studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be more aggressive and better at invading human cells. In fact, the smoke-exposed MRSA was able to kill more mice than non-exposed MRSA. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, stated that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances its survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke functions like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. This is a concerning finding, as cigarette smokers are already known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. The study's results add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.\n\nIn a related study, researchers found that e-cigarette vapor also makes MRSA more resistant, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, as they suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also makes pathogens more aggressive. The study's results highlight the need for continued research into the effects of cigarette smoke on human health and the development of new strategies to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

{"pred": "A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Toulouse, led by Young-Ho Eom, has shed light on the concept of influence and importance in the digital age. The study analyzed Wikipedia pages across 24 major language editions to determine which individuals are considered the most important and influential in the world.\n\nInitially, the study used Google's PageRank algorithm to rank individuals based on the number of links pointing to their Wikipedia pages. However, this method produced unexpected results, with Carl Linnaeus, an 18th-century Swedish naturalist, emerging as the most important person in the world. This was largely due to the fact that Linnaeus' work on taxonomy has led to the naming of countless species, resulting in a large number of links pointing to his Wikipedia page.\n\nTo address this issue, the researchers developed a new method called 2DRank, which combines PageRank and CheiRank (a measure of outgoing links) to determine an individual's influence. Using this method, the study found that Frank Sinatra is the most important person in the English-language world, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII.\n\nHowever, when the study was expanded to include all 24 language editions of Wikipedia, the results changed significantly. According to the 2DRank method, Carl Linnaeus emerged as the most influential thinker in the world, beating out figures such as Jesus, Hitler, and President Obama. This is due to the fact that Linnaeus' work on taxonomy has led to the creation of a vast network of Wikipedia pages, with many species and scientific terms referencing his work.\n\nThis study highlights the challenges of measuring influence and importance in the digital age, and the need for more nuanced methods to account for the complexities of online information. The findings also underscore the significance of Linnaeus' contributions to the field of taxonomy and his enduring impact on the scientific community.\n\nIn a related effort, the Internet Archive is working to preserve and archive Wikipedia pages and the links they contain, in order to prevent broken links and preserve the historical record of online information. This initiative aims to fix broken links on the web and provide a permanent record of online content.\n\nOverall, these studies demonstrate the complexities of measuring influence and importance in the digital age, and highlight the need for innovative methods to account for the vast and ever-changing landscape of online information.", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The new Kinect peripheral, which comes with every Xbox One, can read users' heartbeats and recognize individual voices. While Microsoft claims that the system is not recording users, the always-listening feature has sparked concerns over privacy implications.\n\nBoth Samsung and Microsoft have emphasized that users can opt out of certain features, such as voice recognition and facial recognition, but this may limit the functionality of the devices. The companies have also stated that they prioritize user privacy and have implemented measures to protect user data.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the always-listening capabilities of these devices pose a threat to user privacy, particularly if the systems are compromised remotely by malicious actors.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning about the condition, which affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause severe symptoms such as pain in the arms and legs, difficulty breathing, and paralysis.\n\n**What is AFM?**\n\nAFM is a rare condition that can be caused by various germs, including enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. The exact trigger for AFM is often elusive, and there is no specific treatment.\n\n**Symptoms and Outcomes**\n\nSymptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. Most patients are hospitalized, and some require ventilator support. While some patients have shown improvement, many have not fully recovered, with only three out of 120 patients in 2014 fully recovering.\n\n**Recent Outbreaks**\n\nA cluster of AFM cases was reported in Colorado in 2014, coinciding with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). In 2016, a similar outbreak was reported, with 50 cases confirmed across 24 states. The CDC is investigating the cause of the condition, but no enteroviruses or other pathogens have been confirmed to date.\n\n**Prevention and Treatment**\n\nThe CDC advises good hygiene practices, such as washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick people, and cleaning surfaces with a disinfectant. There is no specific treatment for AFM, but neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis. Researchers are exploring potential treatments, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Prozac.\n\n**Personal Stories**\n\nSeveral families have shared their experiences with AFM, including the Roberts family, whose 3-year-old son, Carter, was diagnosed with AFM in July 2016.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to examine the bloodstains on the shroud.\n\nResearchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth, which bears an image of a crucified man. They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The study concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the Shroud of Turin is likely a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the crucifixion. The researchers' conclusions are based on the fact that the bloodstains on the shroud do not match the expected patterns that would be left by a person who was crucified or hung on a cross.

The situation has sparked concerns across the region, with neighboring countries and the international community calling for a swift resolution.\n\n**Background**\n\nOn March 22, a group of soldiers, led by the National Council for the Recovery of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDRE), overthrew President Amadou Toumani Touré, citing his mishandling of an insurgency in the north by Tuareg rebels. The coup has led to a power vacuum, allowing the Tuareg rebels to seize control of the northern half of the country, including the key towns of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu.\n\n**Tuareg Rebellion**\n\nThe Tuareg rebels, who are primarily from the nomadic Tuareg people, are seeking independence for the northern region, which they call Azawad. The rebels are divided into two groups: the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which wants independence, and Ansar Dine, which is linked to the North African branch of al-Qaeda and wants to impose Sharia law. The rebels have taken advantage of the power vacuum to make rapid advances, with reports of Islamist fighters ransacking bars and imposing Islamic law in the captured towns.\n\n**International Response**\n\nThe international community has condemned the coup, with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) imposing sanctions on Mali, including a border closure and a freeze on the country's bank account.

The UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis.\n\n**Humanitarian Crisis**\n\nThe crisis has exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Mali and neighboring countries, with aid agencies warning that 13 million people need food aid following a drought in the region.

{"pred": "**Global Efforts to Eradicate Institutionalization of Children**\n\nThe practice of institutionalizing children, where they are taken away from their families and locked in institutions, is a widespread issue affecting 8 million children worldwide. This problem is not only morally reprehensible but also economically unsustainable. According to JK Rowling, founder and president of Lumos, a charity dedicated to closing child institutions and orphanages, the solution to this issue is not just a moral imperative but also makes excellent economic sense.\n\nLumos was founded in 2005 after Rowling came across a disturbing photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. The charity's mission is to shed light on the lives of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. The vast majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but they are placed in institutions due to a lack of resources, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization on children are severe and long-lasting. They are more likely to experience malnutrition, abuse, and trafficking, and are often left with developmental delays, stunting, and psychological trauma. In some cases, children are even forced to learn not to cry because they receive no attention or affection.\n\nHowever, there is hope for change. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 with the right investment and support. The charity has already achieved significant successes in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70%, 16%, and 54%, respectively.\n\nInternational donors play a crucial role in this effort, and their support can make a significant difference. By investing in inclusive education and healthcare, providing support to vulnerable families, and promoting family-based care alternatives, children can thrive within their own families and communities.\n\nThe #Letstalklumos campaign, launched by JK Rowling, aims to raise awareness about this critical issue and create a global movement to end the practice of institutionalization. With the support of international donors, experts, and individuals, it is possible to create a world where children are not taken away from their families and locked in institutions, but instead, are loved, cared for, and given the opportunity to thrive.\n\nAs JK Rowling puts it, \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\"", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

The dinosaur, which lived 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, is a crow-sized, bird-like creature with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of researchers led by paleontologist Dongyu Hu, who found the fossil in the Hebei Province of China. The fossil was exceptionally well-preserved, with the dinosaur's feathers, bones, and even its internal organs still intact. The researchers were able to study the melanosomes, the pigment sacs that contain the color-producing molecules, in the dinosaur's feathers and found that they were similar to those found in modern hummingbirds.\n\nThe researchers believe that the dinosaur's iridescent feathers were used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The dinosaur's plumage was a shiny rainbow of colors, with the head, chest, and parts of its tail showing melanosomes that were long, flat, and organized into sheets, similar to those found in hummingbirds. The team was unable to reconstruct the exact colors of the dinosaur's feathers, but they suspect that they may have given Caihong a rainbow glimmer.\n\nCaihong juji is not only significant because of its colorful feathers, but also because it has a unique combination of bird-like and dinosaur-like characteristics. It has a bird-like body, with feathers that were likely used for flight, but it also has a crested head that is more similar to that of a Velociraptor. The dinosaur's frond-like tail has asymmetrical feathers, which are a key adaptation for flight.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has shed new light on the evolution of feathers and their use in dinosaurs. It is now the oldest known animal to have asymmetrical feathers, a trait that is thought to have been important for flight. The discovery also suggests that feathers may have evolved for display purposes before they were used for flight.\n\nThe researchers believe that Caihong juji may have used its iridescent feathers to attract mates or intimidate rivals, and its frond-like tail may have been used for display purposes as well. However, the exact functions of the dinosaur's feathers and tail are still unknown and require further study.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji is a significant find in the field of paleontology and has provided new insights into the evolution", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Retailers have responded by posting signs directing customers to locations outside the city limits where they can buy the products without the tax. This has led to a loss of revenue for the city, with some businesses reporting a 34% decline in sales.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, exempting sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages. Starbucks, for example, rejected the tax, citing its inconsistency.\n\nSimilar to Seattle, Cook County in Illinois repealed its sugary drink tax in December 2018, just two months after its implementation, due to a public outcry and significant losses in sales. The tax was seen as regressive and drove customers to shop outside the county limits.\n\nA bill to bring a sugary drink tax statewide in Washington has been re-introduced, but local businesses are concerned about the potential impact on their sales. Some residents, however, support the tax, citing its potential to discourage people from drinking sugary drinks and improve public health.\n\nCritics argue that the tax is an example of overreach by government, treating consumers like \"mice in a laboratory experiment\" and failing to provide them with enough information to make informed choices. The tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency and its impact on local businesses, which may lead to job losses and decreased revenue for the city.\n\nOverall, the sugary drink tax in Seattle and Cook County has been met with significant opposition and has failed to achieve its intended goals, highlighting the challenges of implementing such taxes and the need for more effective and consistent policies.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The county's high rate of missing persons reports is attributed to various factors, including the cannabis industry, which attracts people from all over the country and can make it difficult for law enforcement to locate them. Many people in the industry do not communicate with friends and family, and some may be out of touch for weeks or months.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and the Eureka Police Department take missing persons reports seriously and follow up on all leads.

Despite her initial denials, sources confirm that she is approximately three months pregnant with her boyfriend Jionni LaValle's child. This news comes as a surprise, as Snooki has been open about her desire to get married and have children, but has also been known for her partying lifestyle.\n\nThe pregnancy news has sparked concerns about the potential risks of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) due to Snooki's history of heavy drinking. FAS is a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy, and can result in physical and neurodevelopmental problems, including growth deficiency, facial abnormalities, and central nervous system damage.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FAS is the most severe form of FASD, and can occur in up to 9 per 1000 live births in the United States. The condition is caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy, and the risk of problems depends on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption.\n\nSnooki's pregnancy has also raised questions about her ability to provide for her child and balance her career and personal life. As a reality TV star, she has built her name on her partying antics and has lined her pockets with endorsement deals for energy drinks and diet pills, which are not suitable for a pregnant woman.\n\nIn related news, Snooki recently appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres show and talked about her drinking habits, admitting that she has overdone it on occasion and doesn't want to be a role model. She also confessed that living with reckless abandon is not always as fun as it seems, and that she often wakes up wondering what she did the night before.\n\nThe diagnosis of FASD is based on a multi-disciplinary evaluation that includes an assessment of four key features: growth deficiency, FAS facial features, central nervous system damage, and prenatal alcohol exposure. The condition is preventable by avoiding alcohol during pregnancy, and treatment is possible through a combination of medication, behavioral interventions, and developmental approaches.\n\nIn terms of prevention, the US Surgeon General recommends that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or while planning a pregnancy, and federal legislation has required warning labels on all alcoholic beverage containers since 1988.

Myrna Arias, who worked for Intermex from February to May 2014, claims that her boss, John Stubits, required her to download the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone, which tracked her every move, including her driving speed and routes taken.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours, likening it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet. Stubits allegedly admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged about knowing her driving speed at specific moments. When Arias uninstalled the app to protect her privacy, Stubits scolded her and told her she had to keep her phone on 24/7 to assist clients.\n\nArias claims that she was fired a few weeks later, and that Intermex's actions were a violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy. Her attorney, Gail Glick, stated that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a legitimate business interest, but that Intermex's actions went beyond that and interfered with Arias' ability to earn a livelihood.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Intermex's president and CEO, Robert Lisy, made a phone call to Arias' previous employer, NetSpend, which led to her termination from that job as well.

Here are five notable examples:\n\n1. **Anthony Scaramucci**: The former White House Communications Director's tenure was the shortest in history, lasting just two weeks. Scaramucci's tumultuous time in the Trump administration was marked by protocol breaches, conflicting statements, and a profanity-laced interview. His wife even filed for divorce during his brief stint.\n\n2. **Chris Christie**: The former Governor of New Jersey and 2016 presidential contender has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the state's history. His reputation was damaged by the Bridgegate scandal, and he was eventually replaced as head of Trump's transition team. Christie's recent actions, such as lounging on a state-owned beach during a government shutdown, have further eroded his public image.\n\n3. **James Comey**: The former FBI Director was fired by President Trump in 2017, just five months into his presidency. Comey's decision to publicly criticize Hillary Clinton's email server and announce an investigation days before the election sparked controversy. The White House provided multiple conflicting justifications for his termination.\n\n4. **Mark Fields**: The former CEO of Ford Motor Company was let go in 2017 after failing to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Despite investing in electric and autonomous vehicle technology, Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure. Fields' attempts to woo shareholders by reducing the global workforce were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n5. **Tiger Woods**: The professional golfer's reputation has been marred by controversy since reports of his infidelity surfaced in 2009. His latest scandal involved a DUI arrest, which revealed a combination of prescription medications in his system. Woods has not won a major tournament since and is currently ranked 899, his lowest ranking ever.\n\nThese individuals, once held in high esteem, have fallen from their positions of power and influence.

The House of Representatives has approved a plan to delay the start of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and repeal the medical device tax, but Senate Democrats have vowed to reject any changes to the health law. President Barack Obama has also stated that he would veto any bill that includes these provisions.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a hardline stance against the ACA, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is determined to block any attempts to gut or delay the law. Reid has taken a tough stance, urging Obama not to engage in direct negotiations with Republicans, and has convinced his caucus to stand firm against any concessions.\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, is expected to be severely impacted by a shutdown. Local economist Stephen Fuller estimates that the region could lose $200 million a day and see over 700,000 jobs affected. The shutdown would also impact tourism, with federally funded attractions such as the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo likely to be closed.\n\nFederal services would also be disrupted, including the processing of new applications for benefits such as Medicare, Social Security, and child-care subsidies. Child-care centers in federal agencies would close, and child-care workers would be sent home. Mail would still be delivered, but planes could be delayed due to the lack of \"nonessential\" support staff.\n\nLocal governments in the Washington region are preparing for the worst, setting aside funds to mitigate the impact of a shutdown. Maryland officials estimate that the state would lose $5 million a day in income tax revenue, while Prince George's County officials say they could lose $270,000 daily.\n\nAs the deadline for passing a spending bill approaches, it is unclear how the situation will be resolved. The House and Senate could agree to a compromise, but it is also possible that a short-term funding bill could be passed to buy more time. Alternatively, a partial government shutdown could occur, which would have significant consequences for the Washington region and the country as a whole.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

According to reports, Neiman Marcus's computer network was penetrated by hackers as far back as July, with the breach not being fully contained until January 1. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, stating that some customers' payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at their stores. Neiman Marcus has apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner, citing a need to confirm evidence before making a public announcement.\n\nIn a similar incident, Target Corp. suffered a massive data breach that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts, as well as the personal information of 70 million people. A 17-page report from computer firm iSight provides new insight into the hack, revealing that the malware used was a type of software that was placed in the store's point-of-sale systems. The report notes that the operational sophistication of the breach was high, with the hackers displaying innovation and skill in orchestrating the various components of the activity.\n\nThe report also suggests that the malware was likely created in regions with strong software capabilities, such as Eastern Europe and Brazil. The tactic used by the hackers was new to eCrime, and involved covertly subverting network controls and common forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers.

The decision to kill the lion was made as a last resort after the situation escalated and public safety was at risk.\n\nMohawk was a well-known and beloved lion, often seen with lionesses in the park. The incident sparked an outcry among Kenyans, with many questioning why the rangers did not tranquilize the lion instead of killing it. The Kenya Wildlife Service has stated that the lion's escape was due to a faulty electric fence, which has been damaged by infrastructure projects in the area.\n\nIn a separate incident, a lion named Sylvester escaped from Karoo National Park in South Africa and was being hunted by wildlife officials. The officials initially planned to kill the lion, citing it as a threat to human safety, but later reconsidered and are now considering various options, including relocating the lion to another park or conserving group.\n\nThe incidents highlight the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflict with livestock herders.

The relic was found in a reliquary at a medieval fortress site in Burgas, Bulgaria, and is believed to have been brought back from the grave of John the Apostle in Ephesus, Turkey.\n\nThe reliquary, which is less than an inch long, is decorated with crosses and is dated to the 6th century AD, a time when pilgrimage to the Holy Lands was common among Christians. According to Milen Nikolov, director of the Burgas Regional Museum of History, early Christians believed the relic had healing properties, and it was likely brought back from Ephesus by a pilgrim who sprinkled rose petals on John's grave, which would produce a wonder-working powder, or \"manna,\" that could cure diseases.\n\nThis discovery is significant not only because of its historical importance but also because it is one of only 43 known lead tubes from the 6th century AD, and the only one found in Bulgaria.

The group's executive director, Pam Dixon, testified before Congress that the existence of these lists highlights the need for increased government regulations to protect consumer privacy. Dixon noted that data brokers are required by federal law to maintain the privacy of consumer data only if it is used for credit, employment, insurance, or housing, but that medical information collected elsewhere, such as from the purchase of over-the-counter drugs, is fair game.\n\nThe lists discovered by the World Privacy Forum include sensitive information such as:\n\n* Lists of rape victims and people with HIV and AIDS\n* Home addresses of police officers\n* Mailing lists for domestic violence shelters\n* Lists of people with addictive behaviors towards drug and alcohol\n* Lists of seniors suffering from dementia\n\nDixon warned that these lists could put people in harm's way, such as the lives of police officers and their families, or open seniors to predatory financial offers.

Mike Brown, a renowned astronomer at Caltech, has been at the forefront of this research. Brown, who is often referred to as the \"Pluto Killer\" due to his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006, believes that he has found evidence of a new planet, which he has dubbed \"Planet Nine.\"\n\nAccording to Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, Planet Nine is a massive icy planet that is estimated to be five to 10 times the mass of Earth. It is thought to be located in the outer reaches of the solar system, beyond the orbit of Pluto, and is believed to be responsible for the unusual motion of small, icy bodies in the region. The researchers have not observed the planet directly, but have inferred its existence through mathematical and computer modeling.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked excitement in the scientific community, with many experts hailing it as a major breakthrough. However, not everyone is convinced, and some have expressed skepticism about the findings. NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has cautioned that there could be alternative explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system.\n\nDespite the controversy, Brown remains confident in his discovery and believes that Planet Nine is a game-changer for our understanding of the solar system. He has even gone so far as to say that he thinks the odds of Planet Nine being real are around 90%.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also reignited the debate over Pluto's status as a planet. Some scientists argue that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet, while others believe that it should remain a dwarf planet. Brown has stated that he has no regrets about his role in Pluto's demotion and believes that it was necessary for the good of science.\n\nIn related news, a team of scientists at the California Institute of Technology has announced that they have found new evidence of a giant icy planet lurking in the outer reaches of the solar system.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over a period of five years, found that those who experienced the largest fluctuations in weight had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased. This can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, emphasized the importance of maintaining weight loss over time. \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off,\" he said. \"Many people are motivated to lose weight, but then they feel they can take it easy. This information can be used as motivation to keep the weight off.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. Researchers have found that people with coronary heart disease who experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death compared to those who experienced little change in body weight.\n\nThe study's results suggest that weight fluctuation may be a concern for people with coronary heart disease, and that maintaining a stable weight may be crucial for reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death. Dr. Bangalore and his team recommend further investigation into the relationship between weight fluctuation and heart health.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Yo-yo dieting may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death in people with coronary artery disease.\n* The study found that those with the largest weight fluctuations had a 78% higher risk of new-onset", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

He took the whole issue of the media, and he had a very candid conversation.\" Politico has an exhaustive list of the topics Trump covered during the 77-minute presser, ranging from nuclear holocaust to CNN, which he downgraded from \"fake news\" to \"very fake news.\" BuzzFeed has video of one of the conference's most heavily commented upon moments: when Trump asked a black reporter if she could set up a meeting between him and the Congressional Black Caucus. Presidential historians tell the AP that no president, including Nixon during the Watergate scandal, has publicly turned on the press the way Trump did. \"It was bizarre theater,\" says Rice University history professor Douglas Brinkley. \"He turned a presidential press conference into a reality-TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.\" GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alice Stewart also found a few things to praise in Trump's performance. \"You can't say he's not responsive to the press,\" she tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \"He answered all the questions from all over the press corps and put to rest the long-standing dialogue that he shuts down certain news outlets.\" Vox lists nine moments that it suggests back up Jake Tapper's description of the press conference as \"wild\" and \"unhinged,\" including Trump's claim that \"the leaks are real\" but \"the news is fake.\" Late-night hosts approached the press conference as gleefully as a kid unwrapping Christmas presents, and the Washington Post rounds up some of their best lines. \"My guess is he did it because he's mad and he just wanted to blow off some steam,\" Jimmy Kimmel said. \"The tone of the press conference was like if your dad found a pack of cigarettes under your mattress.\" David Graham at the Atlantic looks at the continual theme of complaint in the conference and wonders: Does Trump hate his new job?"], "all_classes": null, "length": 10933}

The issue occurred when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The valve, which regulates the flow of ammonia coolant, reached a pre-set temperature limit, causing the shutdown.\n\nAccording to NASA, the crew was never in any danger, and the situation is not considered a life-threatening emergency. However, the shutdown has forced the crew to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems have been shut down in the Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab.\n\nEngineers are trying to determine whether a software fix can resolve the issue or if a spacewalk is necessary.

{"pred": "**Rising Colorectal Cancer Rates Among Younger Adults: A Growing Concern**\n\nA recent study has shed light on a concerning trend in the United States: colorectal cancer rates are increasing among younger adults, with one in seven cases diagnosed in individuals under the age of 50. This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults.\n\nAccording to the study, which analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011, nearly 15% of patients were under 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment.\n\nResearchers found that younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) compared to older patients. Despite having more advanced disease, younger patients had a higher five-year survival rate, with 95.1% of patients under 50 surviving with localized disease, 76% with regional disease, and 21.3% with distant disease.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. She noted that the medical community should be aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool.\n\nExperts agree that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults are unclear, but potential contributing factors may include environmental factors, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, suggested that the increase may be due to an environmental effect that is contributing to the rise in colon cancer.\n\nWhile the study's findings raise questions about whether screening guidelines should be altered to start at a younger age, experts caution that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of such a change. Dr. David Weinberg, chairman of medicine at the Fox Chase Cancer Center, noted that starting screening too early may result in a low yield of cancer diagnoses.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the medical community, with Dr. Hendren warning that the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors who will require long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising rates of colorectal cancer among younger adults are a growing", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, contains a treasure trove of artefacts and bones, including the earliest known evidence of human interaction with megafauna.\n\n**Discovery and Excavation**\n\nThe site was discovered by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard while surveying the area. Excavations revealed over 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile. The team used a combination of optical dating and radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the site, with results indicating human occupation between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago.\n\n**Significance of the Find**\n\nThe discovery pushes back the earliest known dates for human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by 10,000 years, with previous estimates suggesting humans arrived around 38,000 years ago. The site also contains evidence of the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and South-East Asia, as well as the development of key technologies such as bone needles, wood-handled stone tools, and gypsum use.\n\n**Evidence of Megafauna Interaction**\n\nThe site contains bones from the extinct giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and eggs from an ancient giant bird, suggesting that early humans were interacting with Australia's legendary megafauna. While it is unclear whether they were hunting them, the discovery provides significant evidence of human-megafauna interaction in the region.\n\n**Impact on the Debate**\n\nThe find challenges the prevailing view that climate change was the primary cause of megafauna extinction, with some researchers suggesting that human hunting may have played a significant role. The discovery also challenges the Eurocentric view of Indigenous Australians as being less innovative than other populations.\n\n**Importance of the Site**\n\nThe Warratyi rock shelter is considered one of the most important prehistoric sites in Australia, providing a unique window into the lives of early humans in the arid interior of the continent. The site is expected to be a significant milestone in the study of human history and the development of human culture in Australia.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "**Harnessing Energy from the Universe: A Quest for Advanced Civilizations**\n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has revived the concept of harnessing energy from distant stars to prevent the universe from expanding beyond reach. This idea, first proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, suggests that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies to secure energy before they become inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of the universe.\n\nAccording to Hooper, the presence of dark energy is causing space to expand at an alarming rate, and within 100 billion years, stars beyond our Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making them unobservable and inaccessible. To counter this, advanced civilizations would need to capture and harvest energy from stars before they become too far away.\n\nHooper proposes the use of Dyson spheres, a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites that could hover around a star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to a nearby planet. This concept was first described by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\" and later by physicist Freeman Dyson in a 1960 scientific paper.\n\nDyson spheres would be made up of individual solar-collecting satellites, known as statites, which would balance against the pressure of light from the star to remain in place. These statites would form a cloud around the star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe idea of harnessing energy from distant stars is not new, but Hooper's paper adds a new twist by suggesting that advanced civilizations would be motivated to do so to prevent being left behind in the vastness of space. This concept has been explored in science fiction, including in the TV show \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" and in Larry Niven's novel \"Ringworld.\"\n\nWhile humans are still far from achieving this level of technological advancement, the idea of harnessing energy from the universe is an intriguing one that has captured the imagination of scientists and science fiction authors alike. As Hooper notes, if another civilization has indeed begun rearranging the stars, it may not be long before Earthlings notice them, and astronomers could potentially detect the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away.\n\nThe search for advanced civilizations and the quest to harness energy from the universe is an ongoing area of research, and Hooper's paper has sparked new interest in this topic.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

{"pred": "Recent archaeological discoveries in East Africa have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have uncovered evidence of a significant shift in toolmaking and trading networks among early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago.\n\nThe findings, published in three papers in the journal Science, suggest that Homo sapiens or their close relatives responded to dramatic climate shifts in the region by developing more advanced tools and trading networks. The tools, which include small, sharp stone points and blades, were made from obsidian and other exotic materials brought from distant locations, indicating a level of social organization and cooperation among early human populations.\n\nThe discovery of these tools, which are the oldest of their kind, pushes back the timeline for the emergence of modern human behavior by tens of thousands of years. The researchers propose that the development of these tools was driven by the need for early humans to adapt to a changing environment, which included frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions.\n\nThe findings also suggest that early humans were capable of complex behaviors, such as hunting and gathering, and that they had a level of cognitive ability that allowed them to develop and use tools for specific purposes. The presence of pigment lumps, including red and black rocks, which were likely used for symbolic purposes, further supports this idea.\n\nThe discovery of these tools and the evidence of long-distance trade networks challenges the traditional view of the \"human revolution,\" which posited that modern human behavior emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the findings suggest that complex behaviors and technological innovations were present in Africa much earlier, starting in groups that predated Homo sapiens.\n\nThe researchers propose that the development of these complex behaviors was driven by the need for early humans to adapt to a changing environment, which included frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions. The findings also suggest that early humans were capable of complex social organization and cooperation, which allowed them to develop and maintain long-distance trade networks.\n\nOverall, the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide new insights into the evolution of human behavior and technology, and challenge our current understanding of the emergence of modern human behavior. They suggest that early humans were capable of complex behaviors and technological innovations, and that these developments were driven by the need to adapt to a changing environment.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

In March 2014, a villager named Guan Quanzhi was attacked by a wild panda on his farmland in Liziba village. The panda, which had been chased by other villagers, bit Guan's leg, causing severe injuries that required eight surgeries over the past year.\n\nGuan's injuries were so severe that his leg may require amputation, prompting him to sue local government officials and the Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, which is home to over 100 wild pandas. After negotiations, the forestry bureau, the Longnan city government, and the reserve agreed to pay Guan 520,000 yuan ($83,000) in compensation.\n\nThis incident serves as a reminder that wild pandas, despite their lovable appearance, are members of the bear family and possess a fearsome bite. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), pandas have strong jaw muscles, large molar teeth, and a heavy weight that allows them to protect themselves. While they are primarily herbivores, feeding on bamboo, their bite can be very nasty.\n\nThe incident also highlights the importance of conservation efforts for the giant panda species. The number of wild pandas has increased by nearly 17% over the past decade, reaching 1,864, thanks to conservation measures. However, their natural habitat is under pressure from factors such as habitat loss, making conservation efforts crucial to protect these majestic animals.\n\nThe incident has also raised awareness about the risks associated with wild pandas, which are a major tourist attraction in China.

Until now in the US, those who've used this legal tactic have been human.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

The raids, which took place in August 2011, were the second time Gibson's facilities have been targeted by the government, with a similar raid occurring in 2009.\n\nThe Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law amended in 2008 to include plants, is at the center of the controversy. The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, despite being aware of the risks involved. Gibson, however, denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe controversy has sparked debate in the guitar world, with some, like Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the Lacey Act as a necessary measure to prevent illegal logging. Others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature, which could force guitar builders to prove the provenance of wood acquired decades ago.\n\nThe raids have also had a significant impact on the guitar industry, with dealers like Nashville's George Gruhn warning of a \"nightmare\" scenario where owners may be asked to account for every wooden part of their guitars when re-entering the U.S. The law also covers the trade in vintage instruments, which has led to a decline in Gruhn's business.\n\nIn a separate development, the Internet Archive has been collecting data from Alexa Internet since 1996, adding it to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. This data provides a valuable resource for researchers and historians, offering a glimpse into the past of the internet.\n\nIn conclusion, the Gibson Guitar raids and the Lacey Act have highlighted the complexities of environmental regulation and its impact on the music industry. As the government prepares to charge Gibson, the case will likely set a precedent for the industry, and the Lacey Act's effectiveness in reducing illegal logging will be put to the test.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

{"pred": "**Ancient Mars: A Wet and Habitable Planet**\n\nRecent studies have revealed that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, with a massive ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere. The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was approximately a mile deep in some areas and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding, published by NASA scientists, suggests that Mars was a more promising place for alien life to have emerged.\n\nThe research team used infrared maps to study the Martian atmosphere and found that water near the ice caps is enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. This high concentration of deuterium indicates that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times the amount currently locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The scientists estimate that the ancient ocean would have covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters, but it's believed to have pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the Red Planet. The longer water persists on a planetary body, the more likely it is to provide a habitable environment for life to originate or proliferate. An ocean would meet this need, and the evidence suggests that Mars was wet for a much longer time than previously thought.\n\nThe study also found that the ordinary hydrogen in Martian water has been leaking into space over time, leading to a higher proportion of deuterium in the planet's water than on Earth. This process has allowed scientists to estimate the amount of water that once existed on Mars, which would have been enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of 450 feet (137 meters) if it had been evenly distributed.\n\nWhile the evidence continues to mount that Mars was once a wet and habitable planet, it's still unclear whether life ever existed on the Red Planet. However, the discovery of an ancient ocean and the increasing signs of a hospitable chemical environment suggest that the possibility of life on Mars is becoming more plausible. The search for life on Mars will continue with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which will be sent to the planet in 2018 to search for chemical signatures of life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The case revolves around the shape of the Kit Kat finger wafer, which Nestlé has been fighting to trademark in the European Union (EU) for over a decade.\n\nThe ECJ ruling sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) to review a 2012 decision that upheld Nestlé's trademark on the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit. Mondelez, the owner of Cadbury, had objected to the trademark, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be protected.\n\nThe ECJ found that Nestlé had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive, but also dismissed Mondelez's appeal against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016. This leaves open the possibility that the EUIPO could still preserve protection for Kit Kat's shape, taking into account new evidence that the shape is distinctive to people in more countries.\n\nThe trademark dispute has significant implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The case has also been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has featured in Britain's Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat.\n\nThe dispute has been ongoing since 2002, when Nestlé applied for a trademark in Europe for the Kit Kat shape.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex, may not have roared like they are often depicted in movies and popular culture. According to researchers, the sounds made by dinosaurs were likely more similar to those of birds, with a low, throaty whoosh of air, often referred to as \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" This type of vocalization is common in birds, particularly those with larger body sizes, such as doves and ostriches.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization. The researchers also found that this behavior has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. The study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs.\n\nThe researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups. They found that only animals with a relatively large body size, about the size of a dove or larger, use closed-mouth vocalization behavior. This is because the inflation of an elastic cavity, which is necessary for closed-mouth vocalization, is size-dependent and requires a certain level of lung pressure.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur vocalizations. While we can't know for certain what dinosaurs sounded like, it's likely that some dinosaurs made closed-mouthed vocalizations, perhaps during mating displays. The study's authors suggest that a \"Jurassic world\" with booming, closed-mouth sounds may have been more accurate than the roaring, fire-breathing creatures often depicted in popular culture.\n\nIn a related study, sound designer Gary Rydstrom revealed how he created the iconic sounds for the 1993 film Jurassic Park. Rydstrom used a variety of animal sounds, including a tortoise, a horse, a goose, and a baby elephant, to create the distinctive roars and hisses of the film's dinosaurs. He also used his own voice and that of his friend Dietrich to create some of the sounds.\n\nThe study's findings are based on a collaboration between researchers from The University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the University of Utah. The researchers used a combination of fossil evidence, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to understand the sounds that extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors may have produced.\n\nOverall, the study provides new insights into the vocal", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

Jones argued that the name was a \"simple monument for the boys in Tennessee that died\" in the Civil War and that rewriting history is \"terrible.\" However, Zeppos countered that the name was not teaching history but rather perpetuating a painful and divisive legacy.\n\nThe renaming of Confederate Memorial Hall is part of a broader trend of universities across the country re-evaluating the implications of their buildings' names. Middle Tennessee State University, also in Tennessee, is currently considering removing the name of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings.

Republican Gov. Bill Haslam has supported removing the Capitol bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was a Confederate cavalry general and a slave trader.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention has also taken a stance against displaying Confederate flags, urging its congregations to stop doing so.

Bayesian statistics, named after 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, is a mathematical approach that allows for the assessment of various scenarios and the combination of probabilities to determine the most likely solution.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, a team of statisticians from Metron Inc, led by Colleen Keller, was called in to help locate the plane. Using Bayesian statistics, they analyzed the available data, including historical crashes and search results, and created a probability map to identify the most likely location of the plane. The team's initial search area was too large, but the probability map provided a much tighter area to search. Although the first search was unsuccessful, the team was asked to make a second attempt, and after revising their model to account for the possibility that the black box and voice recorder were not emitting a signal, they were able to locate the plane.\n\nThe success of the Air France search has sparked interest in the use of Bayesian statistics in search operations. In the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the search area is vast, and the use of Bayesian statistics may be crucial in narrowing down the search area. However, the complexity of the search, including the new estimates of the plane's location and the possibility of a deliberate act, may make it more challenging to apply Bayesian statistics.\n\nExperts, such as Lawrence D. Stone, chief scientist at Metron Scientific Solutions, argue that Bayesian statistics can help refine and focus the search effort, while others, like Bradley Efron, a Stanford University statistician, are skeptical about its application in this case. The use of Bayesian statistics requires a rigorous framework and the ability to quantify subjective judgment, which can be challenging in search operations.\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is ongoing, and the use of Bayesian statistics may be crucial in determining the most likely location of the plane. However, Colleen Keller, the lead statistician in the Air France search, is pessimistic about the chances of finding the plane, stating that it is \"very likely\" that it is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and will never be found.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of Bayesian statistics in search operations has shown promise in narrowing down search areas and increasing the", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time.

This event is a combination of a Blue Moon, a Supermoon, and a total lunar eclipse, making it a unique and spectacular sight.\n\n**What is a Blue Moon?**\nA Blue Moon occurs when there are two full moons in a single month, which happens approximately every 2.7 years. The second full moon in a month is called a Blue Moon.\n\n**What is a Supermoon?**\nA Supermoon is a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon.\n\n**What is a Total Lunar Eclipse?**\nA total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's light from reaching the moon.

When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

In a swift reaction, Altahan left the road, and her car ended up dangling from the telephone pole's support wire.\n\nFortunately, neither Altahan nor her passenger was injured in the incident. Witnesses, including a person at the nearby miniature golf course, reported seeing the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended from the pole. The Rutland City Fire Department and State Police responded to the scene, with State Police releasing a statement confirming the details of the incident.\n\nThis unusual accident serves as a reminder of the importance of carefully following GPS directions and not reacting impulsively to sudden changes in navigation instructions.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP. Police say 30-year-old Nabila Altahan of Dorchester, Mass., was headed west on US Route 4 when she passed her intended destination and reacted quickly to the instructions, leaving the road at a significant enough speed to propel the vehicle up the wires. She wasn't injured. (This driver followed her GPS into a lake.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 310}

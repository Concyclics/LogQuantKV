The protesters, who had set up a camp on the so-called \"front lawn\" of City Hall, were served squash soup and water, and handed out signs with slogans such as \"What does democracy look like?

However, police did not clear the encampment, and instead allowed protesters to stay until at least daybreak. The Los Angeles camp, which had grown to 400 tents and 700-800 people, was one of the largest on the West Coast and had been tolerated by the city for weeks. The mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, had given protesters until midnight to remove their tents and leave, but later said that the camp would be allowed to stay until at least daybreak.\n\nThe Los Angeles camp had swelled to 2,000 people by late Sunday, with supporters from organized labor, clergy, civil rights, and other groups joining the protest.

The letter, dated May 2012, was published by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, and reveals a man grappling with the moral implications of his creation.\n\nKalashnikov designed the AK-47 in 1947, inspired by his experiences in World War II, where he was wounded fighting for the Red Army. The rifle's simplicity, reliability, and affordability made it a widely used and manufactured weapon, with over 100 million sold worldwide. However, its use by terrorists, child soldiers, and other malicious actors has led to widespread suffering and death.\n\nIn his letter, Kalashnikov questioned whether he was responsible for the lives lost, despite his intention to design the rifle to defend his country. He wrote, \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" The letter is signed with a wavering hand, suggesting that Kalashnikov may have had assistance in writing it, possibly from a priest.\n\nKalashnikov's conversion to Christianity at the age of 91, and his baptism, may have contributed to his spiritual introspection.

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. This increased resistance allows the bacteria to repel common forms of immune responses, making it more difficult to treat. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be inherited.\n\nIn lab studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be more aggressive and better at invading human cells. In fact, the smoke-exposed MRSA was able to kill more mice in lab cultures than non-exposed MRSA. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, stated that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances its survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke functions like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. This is a concerning finding, as cigarette smokers are already known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. The study's results add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.\n\nIn related research, a previous study conducted by the same team found that e-cigarette vapor also makes MRSA more resistant, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health, as they suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also makes pathogens more aggressive.

It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

{"pred": "A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Toulouse, led by Young-Ho Eom, has shed light on the concept of influence and importance in the digital age. The study analyzed Wikipedia pages across 24 major language editions to determine which individuals are considered the most important and influential in the world.\n\nInitially, the study used Google's PageRank algorithm to rank individuals based on the number of links pointing to their Wikipedia pages. However, this method produced unexpected results, with Carl Linnaeus, an 18th-century Swedish naturalist, emerging as the most important person in the world. This was largely due to the fact that Linnaeus' work on taxonomy has led to the naming of countless species, resulting in a large number of links pointing to his Wikipedia page.\n\nTo address this issue, the researchers developed a new method called 2DRank, which combines PageRank and CheiRank (a measure of outgoing links) to determine an individual's influence. Using this method, the study found that Frank Sinatra is the most important person in the world, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII.\n\nHowever, a subsequent study by the same researcher, Eom, found that Carl Linnaeus is actually the most influential thinker in the world. This study analyzed the same Wikipedia pages but used a different approach to determine influence, looking for individuals who are at the center of a large web of links. According to this study, Linnaeus' work on taxonomy has had a profound impact on the scientific community, making him the most influential thinker in the world.\n\nThis study highlights the complexities of measuring influence and importance in the digital age, and the need for multiple approaches to determine the impact of individuals on the world. While the results may seem surprising, they demonstrate the power of data analysis in uncovering new insights and challenging our assumptions about the world.\n\nIn related news, the Internet Archive is working to preserve web pages and fix broken links by archiving pages as they are created and referencing the archived versions.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning about the condition, which affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause paralysis, respiratory failure, and other serious symptoms.\n\n**What is AFM?**\n\nAFM is a rare condition that can cause sudden and severe muscle weakness, often in children, but can also affect adults. The exact cause of AFM is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections, including enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Symptoms include pain in the arms and legs, difficulty breathing, and facial droop.\n\n**Outbreaks and Cases**\n\nThe CDC reported 50 cases of AFM in 2016, with the majority of cases occurring in children under the age of 7. In 2014, there were 120 cases reported, mostly in children under the age of 21. The condition seems to peak in August and September, with a cluster of cases reported in Colorado in 2014.\n\n**Investigation and Prevention**\n\nThe CDC is investigating the cause of AFM, but no specific treatment has been found. The best prevention is to practice good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick people, and cleaning surfaces with a disinfectant. The CDC also advises staying up-to-date on vaccinations and protecting oneself from mosquitoes, as the West Nile virus is linked to AFM.\n\n**Personal Stories**\n\nSeveral families have shared their personal stories of dealing with AFM. Carter Roberts, a 3-year-old boy from Virginia, was diagnosed with AFM in July and can now only move the left side of his face and wiggle a toe. His mother, Robin Roberts, is hopeful that speech therapy will help him recover.

From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully.

They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The study concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the Shroud of Turin is likely a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the crucifixion.

Despite months of negotiation, the matter has reached a deadlock, and Frances Bean is now ready to take the case to court.\n\nMeanwhile, Isaiah Silva is also seeking spousal support from Frances Bean, claiming that she promised to cover his monthly expenses, including private school and housing bills for his child from a previous relationship. He is requesting a minimum of $25,000 per month, citing that he left a steady job when they got married and that Frances has upwards of $100 million in her father's estate.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has imposed sanctions on Mali, including a border closure and a freeze on the country's bank account, in an effort to force the junta to step down.

{"pred": "**Global Efforts to Eradicate Institutionalization of Children**\n\nThe practice of institutionalizing children, where they are taken away from their families and locked in institutions, is a widespread issue affecting 8 million children worldwide. This problem is not only morally reprehensible but also economically unsustainable. According to JK Rowling, founder and president of Lumos, a charity dedicated to closing child institutions and orphanages, the solution to this issue is not just a moral imperative but also makes excellent economic sense.\n\nLumos was founded in 2005 after Rowling came across a disturbing photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. The charity's mission is to shed light on the lives of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. The majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but they are placed in institutions due to a lack of resources, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization on children are severe and long-lasting. They are more likely to experience malnutrition, abuse, and trafficking, and are often left with developmental delays, stunting, and psychological trauma. In fact, research has shown that institutionalized children are far less likely to be educated, physically or mentally well, and are more likely to become dependent on the state in adulthood.\n\nHowever, there is hope for change. Lumos has achieved significant success in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70%, 16%, and 54% respectively. The charity estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 with the right investment in inclusive education and healthcare, support for vulnerable families, and a shift in cultural attitudes towards keeping families together.\n\nInternational donors play a crucial role in this effort, and their funding decisions can greatly influence the availability of support for children and families. Ending institutionalization is not only a moral obligation but also a cost-effective solution, as it reduces long-term costs and promotes economic growth.\n\nTo raise awareness and create a global movement to end institutionalization, Lumos has launched the #Letstalklumos campaign, which encourages people to share their stories and experiences on social media. With the support of international donors, governments, and individuals, it is possible to create a world where children are raised in loving families, not institutions.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer. Rowling has started a charity called Lumos (yes, after one of her Harry Potter spells), and writes that it has made genuine progress in reducing new placements in countries such as Bulgaria, Moldova, and the Czech Republic. She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

According to the PCTA, the number of female hikers has increased from fewer than 10% to 30% in recent years.\n\nHowever, not all hikers are prepared for the challenges of the PCT, and some are putting themselves and others at risk by embarking on the hike without proper training, equipment, or experience. The PCTA advises would-be hikers to \"grow a spine first\" and gain experience before attempting the long-distance hike.\n\nThe PCT is a unique and transformative experience that can be enjoyed by hikers of all levels, but it requires careful planning, preparation, and respect for the environment.

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The dinosaur, which lived 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, is a crow-sized, bird-like creature with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of researchers led by paleontologist Dongyu Hu, who found the fossil in the Hebei Province of China. The fossil was exceptionally well-preserved, with the dinosaur's feathers, bones, and even its internal organs still intact. The researchers were able to study the melanosomes, the pigment sacs that contain the color-producing pigments, in the dinosaur's feathers and found that they were similar to those found in modern hummingbirds.\n\nThe researchers believe that the dinosaur's iridescent feathers were used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The dinosaur's plumage was a shiny rainbow of colors, with the head, chest, and parts of its tail showing melanosomes that were long, flat, and organized into sheets, similar to those found in hummingbirds. The team was unable to reconstruct the exact colors of the dinosaur's feathers, but they suspect that they may have given Caihong a rainbow glimmer.\n\nCaihong juji is not only significant because of its colorful feathers, but also because it has a unique combination of bird-like and dinosaur-like characteristics. It has a bird-like body, with feathers that were likely used for flight, but it also has a crested head that is more similar to that of a Velociraptor. The dinosaur's frond-like tail has asymmetrical feathers, which are a key adaptation for flight.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has shed new light on the evolution of feathers and their use in dinosaurs. It is now the oldest known animal to have asymmetrical feathers, a trait that is thought to have been important for flight. The discovery also suggests that feathers may have evolved for display purposes before they were used for flight.\n\nThe researchers believe that Caihong juji may have used its iridescent feathers to attract mates or intimidate rivals, and its frond-like tail may have been used for display purposes as well.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

{"pred": "Seattle's Sweetened Beverage Tax: A Failure in Implementation and Policy\n\nIn January 2018, Seattle implemented a 1.75 cent per ounce tax on sweetened beverages, aiming to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for community college and healthy food subsidies, and promote public health. However, the tax has been met with widespread criticism and opposition from various groups, including businesses, labor unions, and libertarians. The tax has been deemed regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families, and has driven sales outside city limits.\n\nThe tax has resulted in significant price increases for consumers, with a case of Gatorade rising from $15.99 to $26.33, a 64% increase. Retailers like Costco have responded by posting signs directing customers to locations outside the city limits where they can buy the product without the tax. This has led to a decline in sales for Seattle-based retailers, with Costco's nine Cook County locations experiencing a 34% decline in sales of taxed beverages.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency, exempting sugary drinks with milk as a primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages. Starbucks, a Seattle-based company, has rejected the tax, citing its inconsistency.\n\nThe tax has been compared to a similar tax implemented in Cook County, Illinois, which was repealed after just two months due to public outcry. Cook County's tax was also criticized for its complexity and administrative issues, including a reversal on whether the tax would apply to purchases made with federal food stamp benefits.\n\nA bill to bring the tax statewide has been re-introduced in Washington state, but local businesses are concerned about the potential impact on their sales. Some residents, however, support the tax, citing its potential to discourage soda consumption and promote public health.\n\nCritics argue that the tax is a form of \"nanny statism,\" where the government attempts to control individual behavior through taxation. They point out that the tax has not achieved its intended goal of reducing sugar consumption and has instead driven sales outside the city limits, resulting in lost revenue for the city.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of consistency and fairness, with some arguing that it targets low-income families and small businesses. The tax has sparked a debate about the role of government in regulating individual behavior and the effectiveness of taxation as a means of promoting public health.\n\nIn conclusion, Seattle's sweetened beverage tax has been a failure in implementation and policy, driving sales outside the city limits, losing revenue for the city, and failing to achieve its intended goal of reducing", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

While some cases are still unsolved, many are resolved within days or weeks, with most missing adults being found or returning on their own. However, some cases remain open, including that of Jeff Joseph, a dispensary owner who disappeared in 2014 and whose family believes he was murdered in connection with his cannabis grow.\n\nThe high rate of missing persons in Humboldt County is attributed to several factors, including the county's remote location, the prevalence of the cannabis industry, and the high number of homeless individuals in the area. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and the Eureka Police Department take all missing persons reports seriously, but the process of investigating these cases can be challenging due to the lack of cooperation from some individuals and the difficulty in tracking down leads.\n\nThe National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) is a federal database that connects missing persons cases with caseworkers who compare them against reports and collaborate with families and local law enforcement. However, not all missing persons cases are reported to NamUs, and some cases may remain on the database for years or even decades.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office emphasizes that many missing persons cases are resolved within a short period, and that the majority of missing adults are found or return on their own. However, some families, like Vikki Joseph, whose brother Jeff disappeared in 2014, continue to search for answers and justice.

Myrna Arias, who worked for Intermex from February to May 2014, claims that her boss, John Stubits, required her to install the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone, which tracked her every move, including her driving speed and routes taken.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours, likening it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet. Stubits allegedly admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged about knowing her driving speed at specific moments. When Arias uninstalled the app to protect her privacy, Stubits scolded her and told her she had to keep her phone on 24/7 to assist clients.\n\nArias claims that she was fired a few weeks later, and that Intermex's actions were a clear invasion of her privacy. Her attorney, Gail Glick, stated that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a legitimate business interest, but that Intermex's actions went beyond that and were a complete violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Intermex's president and CEO, Robert Lisy, interfered with Arias' contract with her previous employer, NetSpend, by calling the company's vice president and informing him that Arias was employed by Intermex, leading to her termination.

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark, found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with ADHD and similar disorders.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy were at a higher risk of having children with ADHD-like behaviors.

Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, experienced a similar midterm rout in 1994.\n\nIn her interviews, Clinton defended President Barack Obama and his economic policies, saying that while the stimulus package and other measures may not have been popular, they were necessary to prevent worse economic consequences. Clinton also acknowledged that the Democrats' losses were significant, but not out of the ordinary for midterm elections.\n\nClinton's visit to New Zealand was marked by a minor gaffe when New Zealand Prime Minister John Key accidentally introduced her as \"President Clinton\" before correcting himself. Clinton's visit was part of a nearly two-week Asia-Pacific tour that will conclude in Australia.\n\nClinton's comments on her presidential prospects have been interpreted as a clear indication that she will not run for president in 2016, when she will no longer be serving as Secretary of State.

The incident has sparked widespread outrage and calls for accountability within the agency.\n\nAccording to reports, the agents and officers brought prostitutes back to their hotel rooms, with some even getting into a dispute over payment. The incident became public after a woman involved in the dispute reported the matter to the U.S. Embassy. The Secret Service has since recalled its 11 employees and replaced them with another team, and all of the recalled members have been placed on administrative leave and had their top-secret security clearances revoked.\n\nTwo supervisors, David Randall Chaney and Greg Stokes, have been identified as being involved in the scandal. Chaney, a 48-year-old supervisor in the international programs division, posted a joke on Facebook about checking out former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin during the 2008 campaign. Stokes, the assistant special agent in charge of the K-9 division, is also accused of participating in the misconduct.\n\nThe scandal has raised questions about accountability and personal conduct within the agency, with lawmakers calling for more resignations and firings. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said he expects more dismissals and firings in the case, and Rep. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) suggested that the incident reflects poorly on President Obama's leadership.\n\nPalin, who was protected by Chaney during the 2008 campaign, responded to the scandal by saying she was \"disgusted\" by Chaney's behavior and called for him to be fired. She also suggested that the incident reflects poorly on Obama's management.\n\nThe Secret Service has maintained that the incident is an isolated and aberrant case, but lawmakers and others have expressed concerns about a deeper cultural problem within the agency. The agency has launched an investigation into the incident, which includes interviews with the employees and hotel staff, as well as a review of security footage.\n\nThe scandal has also raised questions about the judgment of those involved, with some lawmakers suggesting that the agents and officers involved were \"stupid\" or lacked common sense. The incident has become an election-year embarrassment for the Obama administration, and lawmakers are calling for greater accountability and transparency within the agency.", "answers": ["One of the two Secret Service supervisors to lose their jobs so far over the Colombia sex scandal joked that he was checking out Sarah Palin as he guarded her during the 2008 campaign, the Washington Post finds.

Here are five notable examples:\n\n1. **Anthony Scaramucci**: The former White House Communications Director's tenure was the shortest in history, lasting only 11 days. Scaramucci's tumultuous time in the Trump administration was marked by protocol breaches, conflicting statements, and a profanity-laced interview. His wife even filed for divorce during his brief stint.\n\n2. **Chris Christie**: The former Governor of New Jersey and 2016 presidential contender has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the state's history. His reputation was damaged by the Bridgegate scandal, and his attempts to curry favor with Donald Trump ultimately fell flat. Christie's recent actions, such as lounging on a state-owned beach during a government shutdown, have only added to his unpopularity.\n\n3. **James Comey**: The former FBI Director was a polarizing figure during the 2016 presidential election, with some attributing Trump's victory to his investigation of Hillary Clinton. Comey's firing by Trump in May 2017 was met with conflicting justifications from the White House. His reputation has been marred by controversy and conflicting statements.\n\n4. **Mark Fields**: The former CEO of Ford Motor Company was let go in 2017 after failing to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Despite investing in electric and autonomous vehicle technology, Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure. Fields' attempts to woo shareholders were ultimately unsuccessful, leading to his departure.\n\n5. **Tiger Woods**: The golf superstar has been embroiled in controversy since reports of his infidelity surfaced in 2009. His recent DUI arrest and struggles with prescription medication have further tarnished his reputation. Woods' lowest ranking in professional golf, 899, is a far cry from his former status as the top-ranked golfer in the world.\n\nThese individuals, among the 50 listed by 24/7 Wall St., serve as a reminder that power and fame can be fleeting, and that circumstances can change rapidly.", "answers": ["Power: One day you have it, the next you don't.

The House of Representatives has approved a plan to delay the start of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and repeal the medical device tax, but Senate Democrats have vowed to reject any changes to the health law. President Barack Obama has also threatened to veto any bill that includes these provisions.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a hardline stance against the ACA, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is determined to block any attempts to gut or delay the law. Reid has taken a tough stance, urging Obama not to engage in direct negotiations with Republicans and warning that any concessions on a short-term funding bill would lead to bigger concessions on the debt ceiling.\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, is expected to be severely impacted by a shutdown. Local economist Stephen Fuller estimates that the region could lose $200 million a day and see over 700,000 jobs affected. The shutdown would also impact tourism, with federally funded attractions such as the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo likely to be closed.\n\nFederal services would also be disrupted, including the processing of new applications for benefits such as Medicare, Social Security, and child-care subsidies. Child-care centers in federal agencies would close, and child-care workers would be sent home. Mail would still be delivered, but planes could be delayed due to the lack of \"nonessential\" support staff.\n\nLocal governments in the Washington region are preparing for the worst, setting aside funds to mitigate the impact of a shutdown. Maryland officials estimate they would lose $5 million a day in income tax revenue, while Prince George's County officials say they could lose $270,000 daily.\n\nAs the deadline for passing a spending bill approaches, lawmakers are scrambling to find a solution. A short-term funding bill or a compromise between the House and Senate could still be reached, but a shutdown appears increasingly likely. The consequences of a shutdown would be far-reaching, with widespread ripple effects on the economy, federal services, and local communities.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The spacecraft will travel within 3.9 million miles of the sun's surface, seven times closer than any other probe has ever gotten to the sun, and will have to withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will study the sun's corona and solar wind, which can cause disruptions to Earth's magnetic field and lead to space weather events that can impact satellites, astronauts, and the power grid. The mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles.\n\nThe spacecraft will be equipped with a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from the sun's heat, and will have a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to keep it at a safe temperature. The spacecraft will make 24 close flybys of the sun, and will eventually orbit within 9 solar radii of the sun's surface.\n\nThe mission is expected to provide new insights into the physics of stars and the sun, and will help improve space weather forecasting.

The lion, known for its distinctive black mane, had been a popular attraction among tourists and was beloved by locals.\n\nAccording to reports, Mohawk had escaped from the park two days prior to the incident, forced out by a territorial dispute with another lion. The animal management team that first arrived at the scene had no tranquilizers, only rifles, and was forced to kill the lion before a second team with tranquilizers arrived. The decision to shoot the lion was made as a last resort after it became agitated and attacked a man, causing deep lacerations and bruises.\n\nThe incident sparked an outcry among Kenyans, with many using the hashtag #JusticeforMohawk to express their outrage and disappointment. Conservationists have cited habitat loss as the central reason for the surge in lion escapes, with the Nairobi National Park being encroached upon by lucrative development projects and the government building a highway through a section of the park.\n\nIn a separate incident, a lion named Sylvester escaped from a national park in South Africa and was being hunted by wildlife officials. The officials had vowed to put him down once they captured him, prompting a Twitter hashtag #SaveSylvester and an online petition to rescue the big cat.

The relic was found in a reliquary at a medieval fortress site in Burgas, Bulgaria, and is believed to have been brought back from the grave of John the Apostle in Ephesus, Turkey.\n\nThe reliquary, which is less than an inch long, is decorated with crosses and is dated to the 6th century AD, a time when pilgrimage to the Holy Lands was common among Christians. According to Milen Nikolov, director of the Burgas Regional Museum of History, early Christians believed the relic had healing properties, and it was likely brought back from Ephesus by a pilgrim who sprinkled rose petals on John's grave, which would produce a wonder-working powder, or \"manna,\" that could cure diseases.\n\nThis discovery is significant not only because of its historical importance but also because it is one of only 43 known lead tubes from the 6th century AD, and the only one found in Bulgaria.

The new policy \"deserves high marks for extending leave to fathers,\" reports Fortune, \"as well as understanding that the entire first year after childbirth can be challenging.\" It's a \"landmark perk,\" reports TechCrunch, noting that Yahoo doubled its maternity and paternity leave in 2013 (to 16 paid weeks for moms and eight paid weeks for dads) to compete with packages offered by Facebook and Google because \"the talent is growing up.\" A decade ago big company perks included free lunch and ping pong tables, but now the major moves are about helping employees balance work and home life because \"experience shows people perform better at work when they’re not worrying about home,\" Cranz adds. Of course, employees will have to plan their leave with managers and coworkers in advance to make sure their absence isn't disruptive—behaving, you know, like adults.

The data brokers, which include companies such as Acxiom, Experian, and Equifax, collect and sell consumer information to marketers, who use it to target shoppers based on their income, clothing size, and other personal characteristics.\n\nThe report found that some data brokers are selling lists of consumers with specific health conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and depression, as well as lists of people who have purchased certain medications.

The group's executive director, Pam Dixon, testified before Congress that the existence of these lists highlights the need for increased government regulations to protect consumer privacy.

It is estimated to be 5-10 times the mass of Earth and has a highly elliptical orbit that takes 10,000 to 20,000 years to complete.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine was made by a team of researchers from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006. Brown and his colleague, Konstantin Batygin, used mathematical and computer modeling to infer the existence of the planet, which they believe is responsible for the unusual motion of small, icy bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system.\n\nThe researchers have not directly observed the planet, but they are confident that it exists based on the gravitational influence it has on the smaller objects. They estimate that the planet is about two to four times the diameter of Earth and is likely an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Mike Brown argues that Pluto's demotion was necessary for the good of science and that it is now an interesting member of the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.\n\nBrown has stated that he has no regrets about his role in Pluto's demotion and believes that the controversy will eventually die down. He hopes that the New Horizons mission to Pluto will help people understand the solar system in a new way and that the discussion will shift from whether Pluto is a planet to what we have learned about the Kuiper Belt.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, and astronomers are hopeful that it will be detected within the next few years. If confirmed, it would be the first new planet discovered in our solar system since Pluto's demotion in 2006.", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over a period of five years, found that those who experienced the largest fluctuations in weight had a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased. This can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, emphasized the importance of maintaining weight loss over time. \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off,\" he said. \"Many people are motivated to lose weight, but then they feel they can take it easy. This information can be used as motivation to keep the weight off.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. Researchers have found that people with coronary heart disease who experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death compared to those who experienced little change in body weight.\n\nThe study's results suggest that weight fluctuation may be a concern for people with coronary heart disease, and that maintaining a stable weight may be crucial for reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death. Dr. Bangalore and his team recommend further investigation into the relationship between weight fluctuation and heart health.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n* Yo-yo dieting may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death in people with coronary artery disease.\n* The largest weight fluctuations were associated with a 78% higher risk of new-onset diabetes, a ", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

The issue occurred on Wednesday when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The valve, which regulates the flow of ammonia coolant, reached a pre-set temperature limit, causing the shutdown.\n\nAccording to NASA, the crew was never in any danger, and the situation is not considered a life-threatening emergency. However, the shutdown has forced the crew to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems have been shut down in the Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab.\n\nEngineers believe a software fix may be possible to get the valve working again, but a spacewalk may be necessary if the issue cannot be resolved through software.

As the forecast coordinator for the Slidell, Louisiana, office, Ricks knew that Hurricane Katrina was a storm of unprecedented strength and would bring catastrophic consequences to the region.\n\nRicks' forecast, titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE,\" warned of a storm that would make \"MOST OF THE AREA UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS. PERHAPS LONGER.\" The bulletin predicted that \"AT LEAST ONE HALF OF WELL-CONSTRUCTED HOMES WILL HAVE ROOF AND WALL FAILURE\" and that \"WATER SHORTAGES WILL MAKE HUMAN SUFFERING INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS.\" These bold statements were a stark contrast to the more typical, bland government bulletins that often accompany weather emergencies.\n\nRicks' forecast was not taken lightly, and he knew that he had a job to do. He had grown up in the Lower Ninth Ward, an area that would be severely affected by the storm, and had experienced the devastation of previous hurricanes, including Betsy and Camille. He took his responsibility seriously and validated each statement in the forecast, knowing that he was giving people a chance to evacuate and save their lives.\n\nThe forecast was issued just a day before the storm made landfall, and the images of devastation that followed are a testament to the accuracy of Ricks' warning. The storm caused widespread destruction, with many homes destroyed, trees uprooted, and a massive loss of life.\n\nRicks' forecast has been recognized as one of the most effective in history, and his bravery and dedication to his job have earned him hero status. His story serves as a reminder of the importance of accurate and timely weather forecasting and the impact that it can have on people's lives.\n\nIn recent years, the National Weather Service has encouraged meteorologists to use more direct and urgent language in their forecasts, as seen in the example of meteorologist Gary Szatkowski's \"personal plea\" during Hurricane Sandy's landfall in 2012.

The initial allegations stemmed from Markham's refusal to take her dehydrated newborn to the hospital, citing her vegan lifestyle and concerns about animal by-products in traditional formula.\n\nAccording to reports, a pediatrician had advised Markham to take Caleb to Florida Hospital South for treatment due to the baby's dehydration and weight loss. However, Markham opted to try supplementing breast milk with vegan formula instead, which led to her arrest on a charge of child neglect.\n\nMarkham's defense team argued that she was simply exercising her right to make informed decisions about her child's care, and a judge ultimately agreed, dismissing the claims of child protective services. The judge also ordered Markham to provide a nutritionist's report within 10 days to ensure Caleb's well-being.\n\nCaleb, who was removed from his mother's care and placed with his grandparents, has since gained weight and is thriving on a soy-based formula. Markham's attorney, Mark O'Mara, expressed hope that the criminal case against his client would be dismissed as well.\n\nThe case has sparked debate about the rights of parents to make decisions about their children's care, particularly in cases where those decisions may conflict with medical advice. While some have criticized Markham's actions as neglectful, others have defended her right to choose a vegan lifestyle for her child.\n\nIn a statement, Markham's grandfather, Bo Markham, said, \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect – there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it.\"", "answers": ["A judge in Florida has allowed a vegan mom who defied a doctor's orders to regain custody of her infant son, reports WFTV.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products. Today, a Seminole County judge granted her custody again with the provision that she provide a nutritionist's report in 10 days. \"There's no case, there's no abuse, there's no neglect—there's simply a doctor who has been challenged by a mother, and he didn't like it,\" says Caleb's grandfather, Bo Markham.

This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults.\n\nAccording to the study, which analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011, nearly 15% of patients were under 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment.\n\nResearchers found that younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) compared to older patients. Despite having more advanced disease, younger patients had a higher five-year survival rate, with 95.1% of patients under 50 diagnosed with localized disease surviving compared to 91.9% of older patients.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. She noted that the medical community should be aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool.\n\nExperts agree that the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unclear, but potential contributing factors may include environmental factors, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, suggested that the increase may be due to an environmental factor that is affecting younger adults.\n\nThe study's findings raise questions about whether screening guidelines for colorectal cancer should be revised to start at a younger age. While some experts argue that the risk is still low, others believe that the trend warrants further research and consideration. Dr. Hendren noted that the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors who will require long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\n\nUltimately, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in detecting colorectal cancer among younger adults, as well as a reevaluation of current screening guidelines to ensure that they are effective in preventing cancer deaths.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, contains a treasure trove of artefacts and bones, including the earliest known evidence of human interaction with megafauna.\n\n**Discovery and Excavation**\n\nThe site was discovered by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard while surveying the area. Excavations revealed over 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile. The team used a combination of optical dating and radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the site, with results indicating human occupation between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago.\n\n**Significance of the Find**\n\nThe discovery pushes back the earliest known dates for human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by 10,000 years, suggesting that humans were able to migrate south quickly and adapt to the harsh environment. The site also contains evidence of the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and South-East Asia, as well as the development of key technologies such as bone needles, wood-handled stone tools, and gypsum use.\n\n**Evidence of Megafauna Interaction**\n\nThe site contains bones from the extinct giant wombat-like Diprotodon optatum and eggs from an ancient giant bird, suggesting that early humans were interacting with Australia's legendary megafauna. While it is unclear whether they were hunting them, the discovery provides significant evidence of human-megafauna interaction in the region.\n\n**Impact on Debate**\n\nThe find challenges the prevailing view that climate change was the primary cause of megafauna extinction, with some researchers suggesting that human hunting may have played a significant role. The discovery also challenges the Eurocentric view of Indigenous Australians as being less innovative than other populations.\n\n**Future Research**\n\nThe study has sparked debate among archaeologists, with some questioning the accuracy of the dating methods used.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "**Harnessing the Power of the Universe: A Quest for Energy and Alien Life**\n\nA recent paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper has revived the concept of harnessing energy from distant stars, a notion first proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. According to Kardashev's model, there are three levels of technologically advanced civilizations: Level I, which harnesses all of a planet's resources; Level II, which harnesses all the radiation of a star; and Level III, which harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. Hooper's paper suggests that advanced civilizations would need to capture stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe.\n\nThe expanding universe, driven by dark energy, will eventually make stars beyond our Local Group of galaxies unobservable and inaccessible. To prevent this, advanced civilizations would need to harvest stars from other galaxies, a process that would require significant energy and technological advancements. Hooper proposes using a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to capture and harness the energy of stars. These satellites would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites that would hover around a star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to a nearby planet.\n\nThis concept of harnessing energy from distant stars is not new, as science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described similar structures in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker.\" Physicist Freeman Dyson also proposed similar structures in a scientific paper in 1960, suggesting that advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems to capture their star's energy. Dyson spheres would be made up of individual solar-collecting satellites, known as statites, which would balance against the pressure of light from the star to remain in place.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres has been explored in science fiction, including in Larry Niven's novel \"Ringworld\" and the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\" While humans are still far from achieving Level III of Kardashev's scale, the possibility of advanced civilizations harnessing energy from distant stars raises the question of whether we might be able to detect their presence. Hooper suggests that astronomers could look for unusual galaxies with altered light signatures, indicating that their prime stars have been harvested by an advanced civilization.\n\nWhile the concept of harnessing energy from distant stars is still purely theoretical, it highlights the potential for advanced civilizations to expand their reach and influence across the universe.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

{"pred": "Recent discoveries in East Africa have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have uncovered evidence of a significant shift in toolmaking and trading networks among early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This period marks the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, a time of great change and innovation in human history.\n\nThe discoveries, published in three papers in the journal Science, suggest that early humans in the region were responding to dramatic shifts in the climate, which led to unpredictable food sources and the need for greater mobility and resourcefulness. The researchers propose that this led to the development of smaller, more specialized tools, such as spearpoints and blades, which were made from obsidian and other exotic materials brought from distant locations.\n\nThe use of obsidian, a volcanic glass, is particularly significant, as it indicates a level of technological sophistication and the ability to transport and process raw materials over long distances. The team also found evidence of the extraction of pigments, including red and black rocks, which were likely used for symbolic purposes, such as painting or decorating tools.\n\nThese findings challenge the long-held view that modern human behavior and technology emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago, and instead suggest that these developments occurred much earlier, in Africa. The researchers argue that the evolution of complex behaviors, such as symbolism, innovation, and art, was a gradual process that occurred over hundreds of thousands of years, rather than a sudden \"human revolution.\"\n\nThe discoveries at Olorgesailie also provide evidence of the importance of social networks and exchange between different groups of early humans. The team found that the tools and materials used by the early humans in the region were not limited to local resources, but were instead obtained from distant locations, suggesting a level of cooperation and communication between groups.\n\nOverall, the findings at Olorgesailie offer a new perspective on the evolution of human behavior and technology, and highlight the importance of considering the complex and nuanced history of human development. They suggest that the emergence of modern human behavior was a gradual process that occurred over hundreds of thousands of years, and that early humans were capable of complex thought and innovation long before the emergence of Homo sapiens.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The new system aims to reduce the time spent waiting in lines and improve communication among passengers.\n\n**Key Features of the New Boarding Process:**\n\n*   Two boarding lanes: Lane 1 (blue) for elite and priority passengers, and Lane 2 (green) for groups 3, 4, and 5.\n*   Five boarding groups: Group 1 (pre-boarding for top-tier elite members, first- and business-class customers, and Platinum- and Gold-level frequent-flyers), Group 2 (Silver-level frequent-flyers, United credit-card holders, and customers with priority access), and Groups 3, 4, and 5 (Basic Economy customers).\n*   Staggered boarding call: Groups 1 and 2 will board through Lane 1, while Groups 3, 4, and 5 will board through Lane 2.\n*   Mobile notifications: Passengers will receive push notifications on their mobile devices when boarding begins, allowing them to wait until their group is called.\n\n**Background and Rationale:**\n\nUnited Airlines has been testing various boarding concepts since last fall, with the new system being implemented at Los Angeles International Airport since February. The airline has received customer feedback indicating that the previous boarding process was a major source of frustration and stress. The new system aims to address these issues and provide a more efficient and streamlined boarding experience.\n\n**Comparison to Other Airlines:**\n\nUnited Airlines joins American and Delta in making changes to their boarding processes. Southwest Airlines has its own unique system, which involves passengers lining up at designated pillars based on their group assignment. The new United boarding process is designed to address the challenges of managing multiple tiers of boarding groups and reducing congestion at gates.\n\n**Impact and Future Developments:**\n\nThe new boarding process is expected to reduce the time spent waiting in lines and improve communication among passengers. However, it remains to be seen how the updated process will affect elite-level frequent-flyers, who may still experience congestion and crowding on busy flights. United Airlines will continue to monitor and refine the new boarding process to ensure it meets the needs of its customers.", "answers": ["The \"angst\" travelers feel at overcrowded gates may soon be eased at United Airlines terminals, an exec for the airline says. That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

Born deaf and with a rare condition called microtia, where the external ear is underdeveloped, Kieran's new ears will significantly boost his confidence and quality of life.\n\nThe surgery, led by consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The new ears were then grafted onto Kieran's head, with the help of a vacuum to shape the skin to the contours of the new ear. This procedure is a major operation, but it brings a significant improvement in quality of life for children with microtia, with their confidence improving exponentially and their performance at school improving.\n\nKieran's parents, David and Louise Sorkin, were overjoyed with the result, saying they were \"on cloud nine\" after the procedure. Kieran's father, David, stated that his son had always wanted big ears and was thrilled with the outcome, saying \"he's very happy\" and that the new ears will boost his confidence no end.\n\nThe surgery is primarily cosmetic, but it has huge psychological benefits, according to Mr. Bulstrode. He said that changing a child's confidence at a young age can change their whole trajectory in life. Great Ormond Street Hospital performs about 40 of these operations each year, although most are to create one missing ear.\n\nAdvances in tissue engineering may soon make this kind of reconstructive surgery even less invasive. Scientists at the University College London Institute for Child Health are working on creating stem cells from patients' fat tissue, which can be induced to make cartilage or bone. This approach would be far less invasive than the current method of harvesting a child's rib cartilage.\n\nKieran will need a follow-up operation in six months to make his ears stand out from the scalp more, but he is already delighted with the result. His first reaction to seeing his new ears was \"Wow!\", and he started to giggle, but the operation on his ribs means it hurts when he laughs.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

This ancient legal procedure, enshrined in the US Constitution, ensures that individuals can challenge their detention and demand a fair hearing before a neutral judge. However, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006 has eroded this fundamental right, revoking habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay and non-citizens labeled \"enemy combatants\" worldwide.\n\nThe MCA has allowed the US government to detain individuals without cause, including legal residents, and has been used to justify indefinite detention and sham trials at Guantanamo Bay. Despite numerous legal victories, the Bush administration has prevented detainees from receiving a fair hearing in court. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the detainees' cases for the third time, with a decision expected to uphold habeas corpus and hold the administration accountable.\n\nMeanwhile, a groundbreaking case in New York has recognized chimpanzees as legal persons, granting them the right to habeas corpus.

The raids, which took place in August 2011, were the second time Gibson's facilities have been targeted by the government, with a similar raid occurring in 2009.\n\nThe Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law amended in 2008 to include plants, is at the center of the controversy. The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, despite being aware of the risks involved. Gibson, however, denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe case has sparked debate in the guitar world, with some, like Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the Lacey Act as a necessary measure to prevent illegal logging. Others, like attorney Ronald Bienstock, are concerned about the law's retroactive nature, which could force guitar builders to prove the provenance of wood acquired decades ago.\n\nThe Lacey Act has also had a significant impact on the trade in vintage instruments, with dealers like Nashville's George Gruhn being forced to be cautious when traveling abroad with old guitars.

{"pred": "**Ancient Mars: A Wet and Habitable Planet**\n\nRecent studies have revealed that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, with a massive ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere. The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was approximately a mile deep in some areas and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding, published by NASA scientists, suggests that Mars was a more promising place for alien life to have emerged.\n\nThe research team used infrared maps to study the Martian atmosphere and found that water near the ice caps is enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. This high concentration of deuterium indicates that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times the amount currently locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The scientists estimate that the ancient ocean would have covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters, but it's believed to have pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the Red Planet. The longer water persists on a planetary body, the more likely it is to provide a habitable environment for life to originate or proliferate. An ocean would meet this need, and the evidence suggests that Mars was wet for a much longer time than previously thought.\n\nThe study also found that the ordinary hydrogen in Martian water has been gradually leaking into space over time, leading to a higher proportion of deuterium in the planet's water than on Earth. This process has allowed scientists to estimate the amount of water that once existed on Mars, which would have been enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of 450 feet (137 meters) if it had been evenly distributed.\n\nWhile the evidence continues to mount that Mars was once a wet and habitable planet, it's still unclear whether life ever existed on the Red Planet. However, the discovery of an ancient ocean and the increasing signs of a hospitable chemical environment suggest that the possibility of life on Mars is becoming more plausible.\n\nThe search for life on Mars will continue with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which will be sent to the Red Planet in 2018 to search for chemical signatures of life. The rover will look for signs of life in the Martian soil, and the discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars has raised hopes that the search for life on the Red Planet may finally yield results.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The case revolves around the shape of the Kit Kat finger wafer, which Nestlé has been fighting to trademark in the European Union (EU) for over a decade.\n\nIn 2002, Nestlé applied for a trademark for the shape of the Kit Kat bar, which was granted by the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in 2006. However, Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury, challenged the decision, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be trademarked. The case has been ongoing since then, with various appeals and court rulings.\n\nThe ECJ's latest decision sends the case back to the EUIPO, which must review its 2012 decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark. The court found that Nestlé had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive, but also dismissed Mondelez's appeal against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016.\n\nThe outcome leaves open the possibility that the EUIPO could preserve protection for Kit Kat's shape, but only if new evidence is presented to show that the shape is distinctive to people in more countries. The brand name \"KitKat\" is not at issue in the case.\n\nThe dispute has significant implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex, may not have roared like they are often depicted in movies and popular culture. According to researchers, the sounds made by dinosaurs were likely more similar to those of birds, with a low, throaty whoosh of air, often referred to as \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" This type of vocalization is common in birds, particularly those with larger body sizes, such as doves and ostriches.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization. The researchers believe that this behavior has evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. The study suggests that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs, and may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays.\n\nThe researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups. They found that only animals with a relatively large body size, about the size of a dove or larger, use closed-mouth vocalization behavior. This is due to the physics of sound production, as the inflation of an elastic cavity requires a certain level of lung pressure, which is more easily achieved in larger body sizes.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur vocalizations. While we can't know for certain what dinosaurs sounded like, the occurrence of closed-mouth vocalization across birds and crocodiles suggests that it can emerge in diverse archosaur species depending on behavioral or environmental circumstances. The study's authors suggest that some dinosaurs may have made closed-mouthed vocalizations during mating displays, similar to birds today.\n\nIn contrast to the popular image of dinosaurs as roaring ferociously, the study's findings paint a more nuanced picture of their vocalizations. The researchers believe that dinosaurs may have made sounds that were more similar to the coos of doves or the hoots of ostriches, rather than the loud roars often depicted in movies.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, noted that the demonstration of closed-mouth behavior evolving many times suggests that it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of bird vocalizations and the sounds made by extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors.\n\nIn related news, sound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the movie \"", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The decision comes after a 14-year effort led by Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos, who stated that the name was a \"symbol and a reminder of racism, slavery, and a very, very bloody Civil War.\" The university will repay an 83-year-old donation of $1.2 million to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which had donated $50,000 in 1933 to construct the building and name it after Confederate soldiers who died during the Civil War.\n\nThe decision to rename the building was met with criticism from Doug Jones, a Nashville attorney who represented the Daughters of the Confederacy against Vanderbilt in a 2005 court case. Jones argued that the name was a \"simple monument for the boys in Tennessee that died\" in the Civil War and that rewriting history is \"terrible.\" However, Zeppos countered that the name was not teaching history, but rather perpetuating a painful and divisive legacy.\n\nThe renaming of Confederate Memorial Hall is part of a broader trend of universities across the country re-evaluating the implications of their buildings' names. Middle Tennessee State University, also in Tennessee, is currently considering removing the name of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings. The proposal faces a tougher hurdle due to a new Tennessee law that requires a two-thirds majority vote to approve changes to historical markers.\n\nThe decision to rename Confederate Memorial Hall follows a series of changes made by Vanderbilt to address diversity and inclusion on campus, including the addition of a chief diversity officer to the university's leadership team. The university's student government president, Ariana Fowler, praised the decision, stating that it demonstrates the administration's commitment to student needs and concerns.\n\nThe removal of Confederate symbols and statues has gained momentum across the South since the 2015 church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, which killed nine black churchgoers.

Despite extensive searches, the plane's fate remains unknown. However, statisticians and experts are using Bayesian statistics, a mathematical technique developed by 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, to help locate the plane.\n\n**Bayesian Statistics: A Powerful Tool**\n\nBayesian statistics is a method of analyzing data and making predictions based on probability. It allows experts to update their estimates of the probability of finding the plane in any given location, taking into account new information and evidence. This approach has been used successfully in previous searches, including the location of Air France Flight 447 in 2011.\n\n**The Air France Flight 447 Case Study**\n\nIn 2009, Air France Flight 447 disappeared while flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. Despite finding debris, the plane's wreckage was not located until 2011. Statisticians from Metron Inc, led by Colleen Keller, were called in to help locate the plane. Using Bayesian statistics, they created a probability map of the search area, taking into account various theories about the crash, historical data, and the uncertainties of each piece of data. The team's initial search area was too large, but after revising their model, they found the plane's wreckage.\n\n**The Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Search**\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is more complex due to the new evidence of a deliberate act causing the disappearance.

The approach requires a large amount of data, and the team must account for subjective judgment and uncertainty. Additionally, the search area is vast, and the plane may be in a location that is difficult to access.\n\n**Expert Opinions**\n\nColleen Keller, the lead statistician on the Air France Flight 447 case, is skeptical about finding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes.

The shooting was staged to make it appear as though Egeland was a victim of assault, and he even called 911 claiming he was attacked after stopping to help a pregnant motorist.\n\nEgeland's scheme was quickly detected, and he was subsequently charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and interstate failure to pay child support. In a sentencing memo, Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Bradford described Egeland as a \"menace to society\" who has been on a crime spree since 2004. Bradford also stated that Egeland's actions caused \"unimaginable\" psychological and emotional destruction to his minor child.\n\nEgeland's defense lawyer, Ryan O'Connor, argued that his client was suffering from a \"perfect storm\" of medical and mental health issues and financial difficulties at the time of the shooting, and that he was motivated by the anxiety of having to report for a 10-year federal prison sentence. However, the judge ultimately rejected this argument and sentenced Egeland to an additional three years and 10 months in prison.\n\nIn addition to his prison sentence, Egeland was also ordered to pay $90,011 in child support and to undergo mental health treatment and counseling while in prison. The judge urged Egeland to submit to a new mental health evaluation when he is released from custody.\n\nEgeland's case highlights the severity of his crimes and the devastating impact they had on his family, particularly his son, who was forced to participate in the staged shooting. Egeland's statement in court, in which he expressed regret for his actions and acknowledged the pain he caused his son, was a poignant moment in the sentencing hearing.", "answers": ["A white-collar crook is facing extra prison time for having his son shoot him in the legs with a 20-gauge shotgun, the BBC reports. Shannon Egeland, 43, was already facing 10 years for taking part in a vast mortgage-fraud scheme when he had his 17-year-old son shoot him by a road in Caldwell, Idaho, in an attempt to avoid prison. \"The psychological and emotional destruction defendant caused this minor child is unimaginable,\" US attorney Scott Bradford wrote in a sentencing memo. Back in 2009, Egeland was co-owner of an Oregon development company that defrauded banks out of $20 million in loans that he and a partner used to fund a lavish lifestyle. Facing prison, Egeland took out disability insurance and had his son aim for his legs. Egeland told police he'd been attacked after stopping to assist a pregnant driver, but investigators got suspicious when his pricey BMW, his wallet, and his cellphone weren't taken, the Idaho Statesman reports. Then they learned about his recent insurance, and the whole thing unravelled. Now Egeland is facing an extra 3 years and 10 months for his roadside scheme and had his leg amputated from the shotgun blast. Bradford called him a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist,\" the Oregonian reports, but Egeland—who is now on three medications for mental health—has cast his own judgment. \"What bothers me the most is my son—the pain is on him,'' he says. \"If I could take it all back, I would, but I can't.

The vehicle was on Autopilot mode with adaptive cruise control set to minimum at the time of the collision.\n\nAccording to Tesla, the crash was severe due to the condition of the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier designed to reduce impact into a concrete lane divider. The barrier had been crushed in a prior accident and had not been replaced. Tesla stated that this level of damage to a Model X has never been seen before in any other crash.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the accident, and Tesla has released a statement regarding the incident. The company emphasized that Autopilot does not prevent all accidents, but it makes them less likely to occur. Tesla also pointed out that the safety level of a Tesla vehicle is 3.7 times safer than non-autonomous cars, and that the company's data shows that Autopilot has reduced crash rates by as much as 40%.\n\nHuang's family has come forward, stating that he had complained to the dealership about the Autopilot system veering towards the same barrier on multiple occasions. They also provided an invoice to investigators showing that Huang had taken the car in for repairs due to this issue. The California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) has released a statement saying that replacement work on the barrier was scheduled, but was delayed due to weather conditions.\n\nTesla has faced increased scrutiny following the accident, particularly in light of a recent fatal accident involving an Uber autonomous vehicle in Arizona.

Williams' filmography spanned a wide range of genres, from prestige projects like \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" and \"Dead Poets Society\" to family-friendly films like \"Hook,\" \"Aladdin,\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire.\" He was known for his generosity in taking on roles that catered to children, often burying his recognizable face and body under makeup and costumes to create memorable characters.\n\nWilliams' stand-up comedy career was marked by his incredible energy and improvisational skills, which earned him a reputation as a brilliant and unpredictable performer. A journalist who met Williams in the 1970s recalled a stand-up routine that left him breathless, with Williams effortlessly switching between characters and accents. Despite his rising fame, Williams remained humble and down-to-earth, insisting that he wouldn't be affected by his newfound celebrity status.\n\nHowever, as his fame grew, so did the pressures of his public life.

This event is even more special as it coincides with a \"Supermoon,\" where the moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon.\n\n**Visibility and Timing**\n\nThe total lunar eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, and will be visible in the evening sky for central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and most of Australia. In the United States, the eclipse will be visible from the west coast, with the total phase beginning at 4:51 a.m. PST, and from the east coast, where the moon will have just begun to enter the Earth's shadow at 6:48 a.m. EST.\n\n**Unique Features**\n\nThis event is particularly rare as it is the first total eclipse of a Blue Moon in nearly 152 years, with the last occurrence being on March 31, 1866. The moon will take on a reddish hue during the eclipse due to the Earth's atmosphere bending the light. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as a \"blood moon.\"\n\n**Viewing Options**\n\nFor those who cannot view the eclipse in person, the Virtual Telescope project will provide a livestream of the event from Australia, starting at 11:30 a.m. UTC. Additionally, the project will also livestream the Supermoon rise over Rome's skyline on January 1, 2018.\n\n**Photography Tips**\n\nFor those who want to capture the event, NASA recommends using a smartphone or DSLR camera. To take a picture of the supermoon or lunar eclipse, tap on the moon on the screen and hold your finger in place to lock the camera's focus, and adjust the exposure slider to get the right balance of light. For a unique shot, put the moon in context with a local landmark.\n\n**Safety**\n\nUnlike solar eclipses, the supermoon and lunar eclipse are safe to view with the naked eye, so there is no need for special glasses.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nThe next Blue Moon to pass through the Earth's umbra will be on December 31, 2028, and the one after that will be on", "answers": ["Look up at the sky on Jan. 31 and you may witness a sight unseen for 150 years.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen.

The elections are seen as a crucial step towards establishing a new government and determining the country's future direction.\n\n**Islamist Groups Expected to Consolidate Gains**\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party is expected to consolidate its gains in the final round of voting, which covers nine provinces, including the North and South Sinai governorates. The Brotherhood has already taken the lead in the first two rounds of voting, with the conservative Nour party coming in second. Analysts predict that the Brotherhood may win a clear majority of the seats in the full Parliament, which could give it significant influence over the country's government.\n\n**Mubarak's Trial Continues**\n\nMeanwhile, Mubarak's trial resumed on January 2, with the chief prosecutor accusing the ousted leader of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensure his son's succession. The prosecutor, Mustafa Suleiman, described Mubarak as a corrupt man whose lust for power will forever tarnish his legacy. Mubarak faces charges of complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the crackdown on the popular uprising that forced him out of office.\n\n**Prosecutor Demands Harsh Penalty for Mubarak**\n\nIn a scathing critique of Mubarak's rule, Suleiman demanded that the former president be given the \"harshest penalty\" for his crimes. Mubarak's two sons, Alaa and Gamal, are also on trial, facing corruption charges. The trial is seen as a crucial test of the country's commitment to accountability and the rule of law.\n\n**Economic Growth Slows**\n\nThe elections and Mubarak's trial take place amid growing economic concerns, with the country's growth slowing due to the unrest and lack of investment. Foreign-currency reserves have declined by 44% to $20.2 billion, and the benchmark EGX 30 stock index has lost 49% last year, making it the third-worst performer among world markets.\n\n**Military Rulers Face Pressure**\n\nThe military rulers, who have been in power since Mubarak's ouster, are facing growing pressure to cede power to a civilian government. The Brotherhood has said it expects the new Parliament to take authority over", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

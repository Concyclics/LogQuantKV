Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have discovered that cigarette smoke can alter the cell walls of MRSA, making it more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is further exacerbated by the fact that cigarette smoke can also make MRSA more aggressive and better equipped to invade human cells.\n\nAccording to Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, cigarette smoke can stress MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls and become more resistant to the immune system's defenses. This resistance is seen in both human cells and mice, with the smoke-exposed MRSA being four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke can make MRSA more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are essential for killing bacteria. Furthermore, the smoke-exposed MRSA was also more resistant to the host's immune response, making it more likely to cause disease.\n\nThe study also compared the effects of cigarette smoke to e-cigarette vapor, finding that cigarette smoke had a more significant impact on MRSA's virulence. Cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA was more aggressive and better equipped to invade human cells, whereas e-cigarette vapor had a less significant impact.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke can be an additional contributing factor to the increasing resistance of MRSA to antibiotics. The study's results have significant implications for public health, as they suggest that cigarette smoke can make MRSA more aggressive and resistant to the immune system.\n\nThe study's findings are alarming, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that can cause severe infections, including pneumonia, skin infections, and bloodstream infections. The study's results highlight the need for individuals to refrain from smoking and to be aware of the risks associated with cigarette smoke.\n\nIn conclusion, the study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke can make MRSA more aggressive and resistant to the immune system, making it a significant public health concern.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract.

However, Isaiah claims that Frances gave him the guitar as a wedding present in 2014, when they were still married.\n\nThe guitar, a Martin D-18E with the bridge modified to accommodate Kurt's left-handed playing style, is now worth an estimated several million dollars, significantly more than its original $1 million value.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

This policy is designed to help employees balance their work and family responsibilities, allowing them to focus on their personal and professional growth.\n\nThis move is seen as a significant step forward in the company's efforts to attract and retain top talent in the industry.

Researchers analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 (15%) were under 50. This trend is a \"wake-up call\" to the medical community, as it suggests that current guidelines for screening may not be effective in detecting colorectal cancer in younger adults.\n\n**Current Guidelines and Findings**\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend that people start screening for colorectal cancer at age 50. However, the study found that younger patients (under 50) were more likely to have advanced cancer and were diagnosed at a later stage. Despite this, they tended to live longer without a cancer recurrence, possibly due to more aggressive treatment. The five-year survival rates for patients under 50 were:\n\n- 95% for localized disease\n- 76% for patients with cancer that spread to the lymph nodes\n- 21% for patients with cancer that had spread to other organs\n\n**Younger Patients' Treatment and Outcomes**\n\nYounger patients (under 50) were more likely to receive radiation and surgery, and they tended to live longer without a cancer recurrence. However, the study notes that the reasons for this trend are unclear and may be influenced by factors such as selection bias and the fact that patients with advanced cancer may be more likely to be diagnosed.\n\n**Expert Opinions**\n\nDr. Samantha Hendren, lead author of the study, notes that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer in younger adults are unclear, but it may be related to environmental factors, such as diet, smoking, and physical inactivity. Dr. David Weinberg notes that the study's findings are \"unexplained\" and that the data does not support expanding screening to younger age groups.\n\n**Recommendations for Early Detection**\n\nExperts recommend that doctors be more vigilant in screening for colorectal cancer in younger patients, especially those with a family history of the disease. Dr. Hendren suggests that doctors should be on the lookout for symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel movements, and pain, which may indicate the presence of colorectal cancer. Dr. Hendren also notes that people with a family history of colorectal cancer should start screening earlier than 50.\n\n**Future Directions**\n\nThe study", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

This is due to the presence of dark energy, which causes the universe to expand at an accelerating rate, making it difficult to access distant stars. To overcome this, a civilization would need to capture and harness the energy of stars from other galaxies, using a swarm of satellites, or \"Dyson spheres,\" to collect and beam energy back to the home planet.\n\n**The Quest for Energy**\n\nAstrophysicist Dan Hooper proposes that a civilization would use a swarm of satellites, or \"Dyson spheres,\" to collect energy from stars.

The energy would be detectable in the form of \"solar flares\" or \"acceleration of stars\" towards the star-harvesting civilization.\n\n**Detecting Alien Energy Harvesting**\n\nTo detect the energy harvesting of alien civilizations, astronomers would need to look for:\n\n* **Spectra of starlight** from the star-harvesting civilization\n* **Accelerating stars** towards the civilization\n* **Infrared radiation** from the star-harvesting process\n\n**The Reality of Alien Energy Harvesting**\n\nWhile the idea of collecting energy from stars may seem like science fiction, it is a concept that has been explored in science fiction and science papers.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR.

However, thanks to several previous operations and a hearing aid, Kieran has been able to hear and communicate with his family.\n\nThe surgical team, led by Neil Bulstrode, a consultant plastic surgeon at Great Ormond Street Hospital, used cartilage from Kieran's ribs to create the shape of his new ears.

The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

The island's parliament has passed a law that makes possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) of marijuana a petty offense, punishable by a fine rather than a criminal record. This move is seen as a major victory for Jamaican lawmakers, who have been debating the issue for decades.\n\nThe new law also allows for the cultivation of up to five plants on private premises for personal use, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. Additionally, Rastafarians can now use marijuana for sacramental purposes without fear of prosecution. The law also paves the way for the establishment of a medical cannabis industry, which is expected to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.\n\nThe move is part of a broader trend of relaxing marijuana laws in the Americas. In the United States, over 20 states have legalized medical marijuana, and several states have decriminalized small-scale possession. In 2014, Uruguay became the first nation to establish a legal marijuana market, and other countries, including Argentina and Chile, have also relaxed their laws.\n\nJamaica's new law does not mean that the country will soften its stance on international drug trafficking.

The company's troubles began when federal marshals raided its Nashville and Memphis facilities, seizing wood and shutting down production. This is not the first time Gibson has faced scrutiny; a similar raid occurred in 2009, when the company was accused of importing ebony from Madagascar, a country with a history of deforestation and illegal logging.\n\nThe Lacey Act, amended in 2008 to include plants, requires companies to ensure that the wood they use is sourced responsibly. The law is enforced by the U.S. Justice Department, which has been investigating Gibson's practices.

Gibson had also been on a tour to Madagascar to explore sourcing wood from the country, but ultimately decided to continue importing wood from the country despite the risks.\n\nGibson's lawyer argues that the company has complied with all laws and regulations, but the Lacey Act is being applied retroactively, causing confusion among guitar manufacturers and owners.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

According to the study, dinosaurs may have made low, throaty sounds, similar to those made by birds, rather than the high-pitched screams often associated with them. The researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the vocalizations of birds and other reptiles, and found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which involve pushing air into an esophageal pouch, are more common in large-bodied birds and may have evolved independently in different species.\n\nThe study's findings are based on the analysis of 208 bird species, with 52 of them exhibiting closed-mouth vocalizations.

Zeppos, stated that the name \"Confederate Memorial Hall\" is a \"symbol of racism, slavery, and pain\" and that it is \"not something that we should be proud of.\" The decision was made possible after the university agreed to pay $1.2 million to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the organization that donated the original $50,000 to name the building in 1933. The payment is equivalent to the original donation made 83 years ago.\n\nThe decision to rename the building comes as part of a broader effort by universities across the country to re-examine their names and symbols that honor the Confederacy. The university has been referring to the building as Memorial Hall since 2005, but the name \"Confederate Memorial Hall\" remained on the building's facade.\n\nThe decision to remove the name \"Confederate\" from the building was met with criticism from the Tennessee Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, who argued that the name was a \"simple monument\" to the soldiers who died in the Civil War.

This achievement marks a significant step towards understanding how the brain processes visual information and may pave the way for decoding internal imagery, such as dreams and memories.\n\nThe study involved researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, who watched YouTube videos while inside an MRI machine.

{"pred": "**Cybersecurity Threats Ahead of Midterm Elections**\n\nAs the United States approaches the midterm elections, concerns about cybersecurity threats have reached a boiling point. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating an incident where an unauthorized attempt was made to hack into the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) voter database. However, it was later revealed that the incident was actually a simulated phishing test, not a genuine hacking attempt.\n\nThe incident highlights the ongoing threat of cyber attacks on the US election systems. The Democratic National Committee's Chief Security Officer, Bob Lord, emphasized the importance of vigilance in preventing attacks, stating that the voter file is the party's most sensitive information. The threat of cyber attacks is not limited to the voter database; the entire election system is vulnerable to manipulation, from voter registration systems in the 50 states to the inner workings of the parties.\n\nThe threat of cyber attacks is not new, and it has evolved over time. According to Rob Joyce, the former White House cybersecurity coordinator, the focus has shifted from using the cyber realm to steal secrets to using it to impose national power. This is evident in the recent detection of a hacking attempt on the Senate and conservative think tanks in the US by Russian intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft has also detected a similar attempt to create fake websites to target the Senate and conservative think tanks. The company has also identified other attempts to disrupt the midterm elections, including a potential attack on the Democratic National Committee's voter database.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has been on high alert for potential cyber attacks, and the FBI has been working closely with the committee to prevent any potential threats. The incident highlights the need for vigilance and cooperation between government agencies and private organizations to prevent cyber attacks and ensure the integrity of the election process.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- The FBI is investigating a simulated hacking attempt on the Democratic National Committee's voter database.\n- The attempt was later revealed to be a phishing test, not a genuine hacking attempt.\n- The incident highlights the ongoing threat of cyber attacks on the US election system.\n- The focus of cyber attacks has shifted from stealing secrets to imposing national power.\n- Microsoft has detected attempts to create fake websites to target the Senate and conservative think tanks.\n- The Democratic National Committee has been on high alert for potential cyber attacks and has been working with the FBI to prevent disruptions.", "answers": ["The FBI is reportedly investigating a sophisticated—but unsuccessful—attempt to hack into the Democratic National Committee's voter database. The DNC learned of the attempt on Tuesday, CNN reports. The attack, which was detected by a cloud service provider and a security research company, involved a fake login page intended to gather usernames and passwords for a service called Votebuilder, which hosts the DNC's voter database. It's a method called \"spearphishing,\" according to the New York Times. \"It was very convincing,\" Mike Murray of the cybersecurity firm Lookout tells CNN, adding that it would be tough to tell the real page from the fake one, even if they were side-by-side. The fake login page was ultimately removed by the cloud hosting company DigitalOcean.

A DNC official tells the Times that it is not clear who the hackers were in this case. But, the paper recalls, a 2016 hack of the DNC was ultimately traced to Russia.

In Philadelphia, about 100 Occupy Philly protesters remained on site at City Hall into the evening of November 28, despite a deadline set by Mayor Nutter for them to leave. The protesters, who had set up a camp on the so-called \"front lawn\" of City Hall, were served squash soup and water, and handed out signs with slogans such as \"What does democracy look like?

The protesters, who had camped out for two months, were given a midnight deadline to clear the lawn, but many remained, with some even growing in number to 2,000 by late Sunday. Police in riot gear closed in on the protesters before dawn on Monday, but stopped short of clearing the encampment. Four demonstrators were arrested during a brief confrontation, and attorneys for Occupy LA asked a federal judge for an injunction barring police from evicting the camp.\n\nThe Los Angeles encampment, which had grown to roughly 400 tents and 700 to 800 people, was one of the largest on the West Coast aligned with the national Occupy Wall Street movement. The camp had been tolerated by the city for weeks, but Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa eventually gave protesters until just after midnight to remove their tents and leave or face a forcible removal. However, police commanders later said they would permit the Occupy LA encampment to stay until at least daybreak.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the city's 5 p.m. Sunday deadline for Occupy protesters to move from a similar encampment came and went without incident. Dozens of people heeded the order, but many tents and other structures stayed put.

The letter, dated May 2012, was published by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, and reveals a man grappling with the moral implications of his creation.\n\nKalashnikov designed the AK-47 in 1947, inspired by his experiences in World War II, where he was wounded fighting for the Red Army. The rifle's simplicity and durability made it a favorite among soldiers, but its widespread use by insurgent groups and child soldiers has led to countless deaths. In his letter, Kalashnikov questioned whether he was responsible for the lives lost, despite his intention to design the rifle to defend his country.\n\nThe letter, typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, is signed with a wavering hand and describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov.\" This marked a significant shift from his earlier stance, as he had previously refused to accept responsibility for the deaths caused by his invention. Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, believes that a priest helped her father compose the letter, which was written at the age of 91, after he was baptized.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church responded to Kalashnikov's letter, with Patriarch Kirill's press secretary, Alexander Volkov, stating that the Church supports the creators and soldiers who use weapons to protect the Fatherland.

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes four times more resistant to macrophage killing and more resistant to antimicrobial peptides. This increased resistance allows the bacteria to repel common forms of immune responses, making it more difficult to treat. The study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that it could be inherited.\n\nIn lab studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be more aggressive and better at invading human cells. In fact, the smoke-exposed MRSA was able to kill more mice in lab cultures compared to MRSA that had not been smoke-exposed. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UCSD and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, stated that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances its survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that cigarette smoke functions like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. This is a concerning finding, as cigarette smokers are already known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases. The study's results add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking.\n\nIn related research, a previous study conducted by the same team found that e-cigarette vapor also makes MRSA more resistant, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases.\n\nOverall, the findings of these studies highlight the need for further research into the effects of cigarette smoke on the growth and spread of superbugs.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning about the condition, which affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause severe symptoms such as limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech.\n\n**What is AFM?**\n\nAFM is a rare condition that can be caused by various germs, including enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. The exact trigger of AFM is often elusive, and there is no specific treatment.\n\n**Symptoms and Outcomes**\n\nSymptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The condition can be severe, with some patients requiring ventilator support. While most patients recover partially, only a few have fully recovered. In 2014, 120 cases of AFM were reported, with 85% of children recovering partially, but only three fully recovering.\n\n**Recent Outbreaks**\n\nA cluster of AFM cases was reported in Colorado in 2014, coinciding with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). The CDC issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing. As of November 13, 2014, 88 cases were reported in 32 states.\n\n**Investigation and Prevention**\n\nThe CDC is collaborating with partners nationally to investigate reported cases, risk factors, and possible etiologies of this condition. While the specific causes of AFM are still under investigation, being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent a number of severe diseases, including poliomyelitis. Prevention of viral infections includes general hygienic measures, such as frequent hand washing with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick persons, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.\n\n**Personal Stories**\n\nSeveral families have shared their personal stories of dealing with AFM.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to examine the bloodstains on the shroud.\n\nResearchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth, which bears an image of a crucified man. They found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. The study concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the Shroud of Turin is likely a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the crucifixion. The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, rather than a genuine religious relic, and has never officially weighed in on its authenticity.

He compared the severity of behaviors such as rape and child molestation to those of lesser severity, such as unwanted touching or comments.\n\nActress Alyssa Milano, a vocal advocate for the #MeToo movement, responded to Damon's comments on Twitter, stating that the \"micro\" behaviors are what make the \"macro\" behaviors possible.

Driver argued that men should not attempt to differentiate or explain sexual misconduct against women, and that they should instead listen and support women's experiences.\n\nDamon's comments were also criticized by other actors and industry professionals, who felt that his attempt to draw a distinction between different levels of severity was tone-deaf and dismissive of the experiences of women who have been affected by sexual misconduct.\n\nIn a separate interview with ABC News, Damon discussed his views on the #MeToo movement and the handling of allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, and Louis CK.

The rebels, who are seeking independence for the Tuareg people, have imposed Islamic law in the areas under their control, ransacking bars and banning Western music.\n\nThe crisis began on March 22 when a group of soldiers, led by Captain Amadou Sanogo, overthrew the democratically-elected government of President Amadou Toumani Touré.

{"pred": "**Global Efforts to Eradicate Institutionalization of Children**\n\nThe practice of institutionalizing children, where they are taken away from their families and locked in institutions, is a widespread issue affecting 8 million children worldwide. This problem is not only morally reprehensible but also economically unsustainable. According to JK Rowling, founder and president of Lumos, a charity dedicated to closing child institutions and orphanages, the solution to this issue is not just a moral imperative but also makes excellent economic sense.\n\nLumos was founded in 2005 after Rowling came across a disturbing photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. The charity's mission is to shed light on the lives of children separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. The majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but they are placed in institutions due to a lack of resources, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization on children are severe and long-lasting. They are more likely to experience malnutrition, abuse, and trafficking, and are often left with developmental delays, stunting, and psychological trauma. In some cases, children are even forced to learn not to cry because they receive no attention or affection.\n\nHowever, there is hope for change. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 with the right investment and support. The charity has already achieved significant success in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70%, 16%, and 54%, respectively.\n\nInternational donors play a crucial role in this effort, and their support can make a significant difference. By investing in inclusive education and healthcare, providing support to vulnerable families, and promoting family-based care alternatives, children can thrive within their own families and communities.\n\nThe #Letstalklumos campaign, launched by JK Rowling, aims to raise awareness about this critical issue and create a global movement to end the practice of institutionalization. With the support of international donors, experts, and individuals, it is possible to create a world where children are not taken away from their families and locked in institutions, but instead, they are loved, cared for, and given the opportunity to thrive.\n\nAs JK Rowling puts it, \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\"", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The film is a mix of traditional horror elements and modern special effects, but it has been met with mixed reviews.\n\nThe movie takes place in the 1890s in rural England and follows Talbot's journey as he searches for his missing brother and becomes a werewolf himself. The film's cast includes Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, and Hugo Weaving, but they are underutilized in the story. Del Toro's performance as Talbot has been criticized for being too similar to Lon Chaney Jr.'s iconic portrayal in the original film.\n\nThe film's special effects have been praised for their visual beauty, but criticized for being dated and over-reliant on CGI.

The PCT, which spans 2,650 miles from California to Washington, has traditionally been a relatively quiet and solitary experience, but the influx of new hikers has raised concerns about overcrowding and the impact on the environment.\n\nThe PCTA has implemented a permit system to manage the number of hikers and mitigate wear on the trail and environmental damage. However, the current system, which allows for 50 permits per day, has been overwhelmed, and the trail is reaching its capacity. The PCTA has issued over 3,000 permits for long-distance hikers this year, with many more section-hikers and day-hikers also using the trail.\n\nThe increased number of hikers has put a strain on the trail's fragile ecosystems, particularly in the desert environments. The U.S. Forest Service has reported 20 rescues in the first 50 miles of the trail, and the PCTA is concerned about the financial costs of helicopter evacuations and searches. The association is also worried about the impact on the trail's natural resources, including degraded vegetation, human waste, and the establishment of new camp spots.\n\nWhile the PCTA is working to manage the crowds, some hikers are expressing concerns about the impact of the increased numbers on the trail experience. Rusty, a 71-year-old hiker who has completed the trail multiple times, said that he misses the quieter days and would like to hike without seeing a line of ants all the way to Canada.\n\nThe PCTA is promoting safety and \"leave no trace\" practices through its #responsiblywild campaign, which encourages hikers to protect water quality, bury human waste, and pack out trash. The association is also working to educate hikers about the importance of responsible trail use and the impact of their actions on the environment.\n\nOverall, the increased popularity of the PCT has brought both benefits and challenges. While the trail has become more accessible to a wider range of people, it has also raised concerns about overcrowding and the impact on the environment. The PCTA is working to balance the needs of hikers with the need to protect the trail and its natural resources.", "answers": ["Hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail can expect to encounter harsh-but-beautiful landscapes, extreme fatigue, and—these days, at least—traffic. \"You can’t talk about the Pacific Crest Trail without mentioning the crowds,\" Pete Brook writes for Outside. He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\" (This female hiker is the \"biggest badass you've never heard of.\")"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2416}

The discovery was announced in the journal Nature Communications and has shed new light on the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs.\n\nCaihong juji, which translates to \"rainbow with a big crest\" in Mandarin, is a crow-sized, bird-like dinosaur with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds. The dinosaur's feathers were found to be iridescent, with microscopic structures called melanosomes that were responsible for pigmentation. The melanosomes were detected using powerful microscopes and were found to be pancake-shaped, similar to those of hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji suggests that the Jurassic Period was a more colorful time than previously imagined, with dinosaurs sporting vibrant feathers that may have been used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The dinosaur's plumage was likely used for both social and sexual cues, with its iridescent feathers on its head, chest, and tail creating a dazzling display.\n\nCaihong juji's feathers were not only colorful but also had a unique structure, with long, flat melanosomes that were organized into sheets, similar to those found in hummingbirds. This structure is thought to have created a metallic sheen that changed color with the viewing angle, giving the dinosaur a rainbow glimmer.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has also provided new insights into the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs. The dinosaur's frond-like tail had asymmetrical feathers, which were likely used for flight. This is the oldest known example of this adaptation, and it predates the iconic bird-like dinosaur Archaeopteryx by 10 million years.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has sparked new questions about the behavior and social interactions of dinosaurs. While it is not clear how the dinosaur used its iridescent feathers, researchers believe that it may have used them for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The discovery of Caihong juji has also highlighted the importance of feathers in the evolution of birds and has provided new insights into the complex social behaviors of dinosaurs.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of Caihong juji has shed new light on the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs and has provided a glimpse into the complex social behaviors of these ancient creatures.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

{"pred": "Seattle's Sweetened Beverage Tax: A Failing Experiment\n\nIn 2018, Seattle implemented a 1.75 cent per ounce tax on sweetened beverages, aiming to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for community projects, and subsidize healthy food purchases for low-income families. However, the tax has been met with widespread opposition and criticism. The tax has led to significant price increases, with a case of Gatorade rising from $15.99 to $26.33, a 64% increase. Retailers like Costco have responded by posting signs directing customers to locations outside city limits where they can buy the product without the tax.\n\nThe tax has been particularly burdensome for low-income families, who are disproportionately affected by the regressive tax. Many Seattle residents are upset about the tax, questioning its effectiveness in reducing sugar consumption and its impact on local businesses. The tax has also led to a decline in sales for retailers, with Costco's nine Cook County locations seeing a 34% decline in sales of taxed beverages.\n\nThe tax has been a failure in other jurisdictions as well. In Cook County, Illinois, the sweetened beverage tax was repealed after just two months due to a public outcry. The tax led to a 47% decline in sweetened beverage sales for independent retailers and a 38% increase in sales in neighboring counties. The tax also triggered numerous lawsuits and administrative gaffes, which contributed to its downfall.\n\nA similar tax is being considered in Spokane, Washington, but local businesses are worried about the impact on their sales. The tax would add nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold and would also include a tax on syrups and powders used to make soda. Some residents support the tax, citing its potential to discourage people from drinking soda, which can lead to health problems.\n\nCritics of the tax argue that it is a regressive tax that disproportionately affects low-income families and that it is not an effective way to reduce sugar consumption. They also point out that the tax is inconsistent, exempting sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as flavored coffee beverages. The tax has also been criticized for its lack of transparency and its failure to provide clear data on its effectiveness.\n\nOverall, Seattle's sweetened beverage tax has been a failure, leading to significant price increases, declining sales, and a public outcry. The tax has also highlighted the need for more effective and equitable policies to address public health concerns.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The county's high rate of missing persons reports is attributed to several factors, including the cannabis industry, which attracts people from all over the country and can make it difficult for law enforcement to track their whereabouts. Many people in the industry may not communicate with friends and family, and some may even go off the grid for extended periods.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and the Eureka Police Department have implemented various measures to address the issue, including using the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) to track missing persons cases. However, the process can be frustrating for families who are searching for their loved ones, as seen in the case of Vikki Joseph, whose brother Jeff disappeared in 2014 while working in the cannabis industry. Despite extensive investigation, Jeff's case remains unsolved, and his family has had to take on much of the investigative work themselves.\n\nThe county's high rate of missing persons reports has also led to concerns about the accuracy of the data. Some people may be reported missing multiple times, generating multiple reports, while others may not be missing at all. The county's high rate of missing children reports is also attributed to the high number of children in transitional and foster care, who are at a higher risk of running away.\n\nIn an effort to address the issue, the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office is working to improve communication with families and encourage them to come forward with information. The office also emphasizes that many people who are reported missing may not be in danger, but rather may be choosing to lay low or avoid contact with their loved ones.\n\nOverall, the issue of missing persons in Humboldt County is complex and multifaceted, requiring a collaborative effort from law", "answers": ["It turns out missing people are pretty easy to find when they appear every week in your living room.

Myrna Arias, who worked for Intermex from February to May 2014, claims that her boss, John Stubits, required her to install the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone, which tracked her every move, including her driving speed and routes taken.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Arias had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours but objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours, likening it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet. Stubits allegedly admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged about knowing her driving speed at specific moments. Arias complained to Stubits that this was an invasion of her privacy, but he told her to tolerate the intrusion because Intermex was paying her more than her previous employer.\n\nArias' attorney, Gail Glick, stated that the app allowed her client's bosses to see every move she made throughout the day, including her driving routes and time spent at customer locations. Glick also claimed that even if Arias shut down the app on her phone, it would still be running in the background. Arias was eventually fired a few weeks after uninstalling the app, and her complaint alleges that Intermex's president and CEO, Robert Lisy, interfered with her contract with her previous employer, NetSpend, resulting in her termination from that job as well.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $500,000 and alleges invasion of privacy, retaliation, unfair business practices, and other claims.

In interviews with New Zealand media, Clinton emphasized that she has no plans to run for the top U.S. office, despite speculation fueled by the Democratic Party's losses in the recent midterm elections.\n\nClinton's comments come as the Democratic Party struggles to come to terms with its losses in the House of Representatives, where Republicans gained at least 60 seats.

Here are five notable examples:\n\n1. **Anthony Scaramucci**: The former White House Communications Director's tenure was the shortest in history, lasting only 11 days. Scaramucci's tumultuous time in the Trump administration was marked by protocol breaches, conflicting statements, and a profanity-laced interview. His wife even filed for divorce during his brief stint.\n\n2. **Chris Christie**: The former Governor of New Jersey and 2016 presidential contender has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the state's history. His reputation was damaged by the Bridgegate scandal, and his attempts to curry favor with Donald Trump ultimately fell flat. Christie's recent actions, such as lounging on a state-owned beach during a government shutdown, have only added to his unpopularity.\n\n3. **James Comey**: The former FBI Director was a polarizing figure during the 2016 presidential election, with some attributing Trump's victory to his investigation of Hillary Clinton. However, Trump abruptly fired Comey in May 2017, citing conflicting justifications. Comey's tenure was marked by controversy, including his public criticism of Clinton's email server and his decision to announce an investigation just days before the election.\n\n4. **Mark Fields**: The former CEO of Ford Motor Company was let go in 2017 after failing to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Despite investing in electric and autonomous vehicle technology, Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure. Fields' determination to take on Tesla ultimately led to his downfall.\n\n5. **Tiger Woods**: The professional golfer's reputation has been marred by controversy, including reports of infidelity and a DUI arrest. Woods' latest scandal involved a combination of prescription medications, which led to a clinic stay to manage his drug use. His ranking has plummeted to 899, his lowest ever, and he has not won a major tournament since 2008.\n\nThese individuals, among the 50 listed by 24/7 Wall St., serve as a reminder that power and fame can be fleeting, and that circumstances can change rapidly.", "answers": ["Power: One day you have it, the next you don't.

The House of Representatives has approved a plan to delay the start of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and repeal the medical device tax, but Senate Democrats have vowed to reject any changes to the health law. President Barack Obama has also threatened to veto any bill that includes these provisions.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a hardline stance on the ACA, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) is determined to block any attempts to gut or delay the law. Reid has taken a tough stance, urging Obama not to engage in direct negotiations with Republicans, and has convinced his caucus to stand firm against any concessions.\n\nThe Washington region, which is home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, is expected to be severely impacted by a shutdown. Local economist Stephen Fuller estimates that the region could lose $200 million a day and see over 700,000 jobs affected. The shutdown could also lead to a loss of income tax revenue for local governments, with Maryland officials estimating a loss of $5 million a day and Prince George's County officials expecting to lose $270,000 daily.\n\nThe shutdown could have widespread ripple effects, including:\n\n* Delayed or halted services such as trash pickup, library services, and Meals on Wheels\n* Furloughs for non-essential federal workers, including child-care workers and contractors\n* Delays in processing federal benefits, including Social Security and Medicare\n* Closures of national parks and monuments, and delays in processing passport and visa applications\n* Disruptions to the federal judiciary, including delayed court proceedings and bankruptcy cases\n\nLocal governments are preparing for the worst, setting aside funds to mitigate the impact of a shutdown. However, the situation remains uncertain, and it is unclear whether Congress will be able to reach an agreement before the Monday night deadline.\n\n**Possible Scenarios:**\n\n* A short-term funding bill could be passed to buy more time for negotiations\n* A partial government shutdown could occur, with some agencies remaining open while others are closed\n* A compromise could be reached between the House and Senate, but it is unclear how this would materialize\n\n**Key Players:**\n\n* House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH)\n* Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV)\n* President Barack Obama\n* Rep.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission is named after Eugene Parker, a renowned astrophysicist who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. Parker's theory was initially met with skepticism but was later confirmed by satellite observations. The Parker Solar Probe will be the first spacecraft to fly directly into the sun's corona, the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere, and will provide unprecedented insights into the sun's behavior.\n\nThe spacecraft will be equipped with a 7.5-foot-wide heat shield made of advanced carbon-composite material to protect it from temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. The probe will make 24 close flybys of the sun, some of which will bring it within 3.9 million miles of the solar surface, seven times closer than any other probe has ever gotten to the sun.\n\nThe mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will also carry a chip with photos of Eugene Parker and a copy of his seminal 1958 solar-wind paper, as well as a plate carrying an inscription of his choice. The mission is scheduled to launch in July 2018 and will take seven years to complete.\n\nThe mission is expected to provide significant benefits, including a better understanding of the sun's behavior, improved space weather forecasting, and a greater understanding of the solar wind. The solar wind is a stream of charged gases from the sun that affects the Earth's magnetic field and can cause disruptions to communication and navigation systems.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is a historic mission that will push the boundaries of space exploration and provide new insights into the sun's behavior. The mission is a testament to the importance of Eugene Parker's work and his contributions to the field of astrophysics.\n\nThe mission's findings will have significant implications for our understanding of the sun and its behavior, and will help us better prepare for and mitigate the effects of space weather on our planet.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

According to reports, Neiman Marcus's computer network was penetrated by hackers as far back as July, with the breach not being fully contained until January 1. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, stating that some customers' payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at their stores. Neiman Marcus has apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner, citing a need to confirm evidence before making a public announcement.\n\nIn a similar incident, Target Corp. suffered a massive data breach that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts, as well as the personal information of 70 million people. A 17-page report from computer firm iSight provides new insight into the hack, revealing that the malware used was a type of computer virus that was placed in the store's point-of-sale systems. The report notes that the hackers displayed a high degree of skill and innovation in orchestrating the breach, and that the malware was likely created in regions with known software capabilities, such as Eastern Europe and Brazil.\n\nA separate report prepared by federal and private investigators suggests that the Target breach may be part of a broader and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. The report, sent to financial-services companies and retailers, offers some of the first details to emerge about the source of the attack.\n\nBoth Neiman Marcus and Target have offered to provide customers with one year of free credit monitoring, and a growing group of state attorneys general are jointly investigating the breaches to determine whether they are related.

The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said that the lion was a threat to public safety and that the decision to kill it was taken as a last resort.\n\nThe incident is not an isolated one, as several lions have escaped from Nairobi National Park in recent weeks, with most being recaptured alive. However, the park's infrastructure, including its electric fence, has been compromised due to construction and development projects in the area. The KWS has attributed the surge in escapes to habitat loss and the increasing encroachment of the park by development projects.\n\nIn a separate incident in South Africa, a 3-year-old male lion named Sylvester escaped from Karoo National Park and is currently being hunted by wildlife officials.

The company will continue to pay employees normally, eliminating the need to switch to state or disability pay.\n\nAccording to Tawni Cranz, Netflix's Chief Talent Officer, the policy is designed to give employees the flexibility and confidence to balance the needs of their growing families without worrying about work or finances. The company believes that this policy will allow employees to return to work more focused and dedicated, which is essential for its continued success in competing for and keeping the most talented individuals in the field.\n\nThis new policy is a significant step forward for Netflix, which has already been recognized for its unlimited time-off policy. The company's move to extend leave to fathers and acknowledge the challenges of the first year after childbirth is a notable one. However, it's worth noting that unlimited time-off policies can have their pitfalls, including the potential for extended absences to strain workplace relations.\n\nThe introduction of this policy is a clear reminder that Netflix is committed to providing its employees with a better work-life balance, a trend that has shifted from the traditional perks of ping pong tables and free snacks to more comprehensive benefits like unlimited leave and flexible work arrangements. As the tech industry continues to evolve, companies like Netflix are recognizing the importance of supporting their employees' personal and professional needs.\n\nOverall, Netflix's unlimited maternity and paternity leave policy is a significant step forward in the company's efforts to attract and retain top talent, and sets a new standard for the industry.", "answers": ["Expecting parents wondering which company offers the best maternity and paternity leave in the US need look no further.

The data brokers, which include companies such as Acxiom, Experian, and Equifax, collect and sell consumer information to marketers, who use it to target shoppers based on their income, clothing size, and other personal characteristics.\n\nThe report found that some data brokers are selling lists of consumers with specific health conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and depression, as well as lists of people who have purchased certain medications. Equifax, one of the companies queried by the Committee, revealed that it has information on consumers' purchasing habits, including whether they have bought specific products such as soft drinks or shampoo, and even how many whiskey drinks they have consumed in the past 30 days.\n\nThe World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization, has also uncovered lists of sensitive information, including the home addresses of police officers, a mailing list for domestic violence shelters, and a list of people with addictive behaviors towards drug and alcohol. The existence of these lists highlights the need for increased government regulations, said Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum.\n\nCurrently, data brokers are only required to maintain the privacy of consumer data if it is used for credit, employment, insurance, or housing. However, medical information that data brokers collect elsewhere, such as from the purchase of over-the-counter drugs and other health care items, is fair game. This lack of regulation has led to the creation of lists that could put people in harm's way, such as a list of over 30,000 police officers' home addresses, which could put the lives of the officers and their families in danger.\n\nThe Senate Commerce Committee has called for tighter government regulations on the data brokerage industry, and the Federal Trade Commission has also urged major data brokers to increase transparency into their data practices.

The discovery was made by researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), led by Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006.\n\nBrown and his team used mathematical and computer modeling to infer the existence of the planet, which they believe is exerting a gravitational influence on the orbits of smaller objects in the outer solar system. They estimate the planet's mass to be five to 10 times that of Earth and its diameter to be two to four times that of Earth.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet and whether Pluto should be reinstated as a planet. However, Brown argues that Pluto's demotion was necessary for the good of science and that it is now clear that the solar system has eight dominant objects, which are the planets we know.\n\nBrown's team has been searching for Planet Nine using telescopes on at least two continents, but so far, it has not been directly observed. They believe that the planet is likely to be an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas and that it may not make its closest approach to the sun for thousands of years.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also been compared to the discovery of Neptune in the 19th century, which was made possible by careful observation of the seventh planet, Uranus. Brown and his team are hopeful that their research will infuse the search for Planet Nine with new energy and that it will be discovered within the next few years.\n\nIn related news, NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has cautioned that there could be other explanations for the observed motion of the small bodies in the outer solar system, and that the Sagan rule, which states that \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,\" should be applied.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

For example, Trump claimed that he won the largest Electoral College victory since Ronald Reagan, but in fact, he won 304 electoral votes, not 306. He also claimed that his administration is \"a fine-tuned machine,\" but his first month has been marked by a series of missteps and controversies.\n\nOverall, the press conference was seen as a attempt by Trump to regain control of the narrative and defend his administration's early days.

The issue occurred when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The valve, which regulates the flow of ammonia coolant, reached a pre-set temperature limit, causing the shutdown.\n\nAccording to NASA, the crew was never in any danger, and the situation is not a life-threatening emergency.

The initial allegations stemmed from Markham's refusal to take her dehydrated newborn to the hospital, citing her vegan lifestyle and concerns about animal by-products in traditional formula.\n\nAccording to reports, a pediatrician had advised Markham to take Caleb to Florida Hospital South for treatment due to the baby's dehydration and weight loss. However, Markham opted to try supplementing breast milk with vegan formula instead, which led to her arrest on a charge of child neglect.\n\nMarkham's defense team argued that she was simply exercising her right to make informed decisions about her child's care, and a Seminole County judge ultimately agreed, dismissing the child protective services' claim that Markham was unfit to care for Caleb. The judge also ordered Markham to provide a nutritionist's report within 10 days.\n\nCaleb, who was removed from his mother's care and placed with his grandparents, has since gained weight and is thriving on a soy-based formula. Markham's attorney, Mark O'Mara, expressed hope that the criminal case against his client will be dismissed as well.\n\nThe case has sparked debate about the rights of parents to make decisions about their children's care, particularly in cases where those decisions may conflict with medical advice.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products.

This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults.\n\nAccording to the study, which analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011, nearly 15% of patients were under 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment.\n\nResearchers found that younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery (72% vs. 63%) and radiation therapy (53% vs. 48%) compared to older patients. Despite having more advanced disease, younger patients had better five-year survival rates, with 95.1% surviving with localized disease, 76% with regional disease, and 21.3% with distant disease.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. She noted that the medical community should be aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool.\n\nExperts agree that the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unclear, but possible contributing factors include environmental influences, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, suggested that the increase may be linked to an environmental factor.\n\nThe study's findings raise questions about whether screening guidelines should be altered to start at a younger age. While some experts argue that the risk is still low, others believe that the increasing incidence of colon cancer among younger adults warrants further research and consideration of earlier screening.\n\nUltimately, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in detecting colorectal cancer among younger adults, as well as the importance of addressing the potential environmental and lifestyle factors contributing to this trend.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

{"pred": "**Ancient Human Settlement in Australia Uncovered**\n\nA groundbreaking discovery in the Flinders Ranges of southern Australia has revealed a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, challenging previous estimates of human arrival in the continent. The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, contains a treasure trove of artefacts and bones, including the earliest known evidence of human interaction with megafauna.\n\n**Discovery and Excavation**\n\nThe site was discovered by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard while surveying the area. Excavations revealed over 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 mammals and one reptile. The team used a combination of optical dating and radiocarbon dating to determine the age of the site, with results indicating human settlement between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago.\n\n**Significance of the Find**\n\nThe discovery pushes back the earliest known dates on the development of key technologies such as stone axes, bone needles, and ochre use in Australia. The site also provides evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum, a giant wombat-like species. This challenges the previous assumption that climate change was the primary cause of megafauna extinction.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThe find suggests that humans were able to migrate south from the northern part of the continent to the southern interior much earlier than previously thought. The discovery also challenges the Eurocentric view that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world.\n\n**Comparison to Previous Finds**\n\nThe Warratyi rock shelter site is significant because it is located in the arid interior of Australia, making it a more difficult trek than previous sites. The site is also much farther from the early settlement of Lake Mungo in southeastern New South Wales, making it a more impressive achievement for early humans.\n\n**Debate and Controversy**\n\nThe discovery has sparked debate among archaeologists, with some questioning the accuracy of the dating methods used. However, the majority of experts agree that the find is significant and provides valuable insights into the history of human settlement in Australia.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe discovery of the Warratyi rock shelter site is a major breakthrough in the field of archaeology, providing evidence of human settlement in Australia 10,000 years earlier than previously thought. The site challenges previous assumptions about human migration and technological development in Australia, and highlights the ingenuity and adaptability of Indigenous Australians.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": "**Harnessing Energy from the Universe: A Quest for Advanced Civilizations**\n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has revived the concept of harnessing energy from distant stars to prevent the universe from expanding beyond reach. This idea, first proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, suggests that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies to secure energy before they become inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of the universe.\n\nAccording to Hooper, the presence of dark energy is causing space to expand at an alarming rate, and within 100 billion years, stars beyond our Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making them unobservable and inaccessible. To counter this, advanced civilizations would need to capture and harvest energy from stars before they become lost forever.\n\nHooper proposes the use of Dyson spheres, a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites that could hover around a star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to a nearby planet. This concept was first described by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\" and later by physicist Freeman Dyson in a 1960 scientific paper.\n\nDyson spheres would be made up of individual solar-collecting satellites, known as statites, which would balance against the pressure of light from the sun to remain in place. A ring of statites would form a cloud around the star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe idea of harnessing energy from distant stars is not new, but Hooper's paper adds a new twist by suggesting that advanced civilizations would not only capture stars but also accelerate them back towards their home galaxy, making them visible as a result of the propulsion. This would produce significant fluxes of electromagnetic radiation, making it detectable by astronomers.\n\nWhile humans are still far from reaching the level of advanced civilizations that could harness energy from distant stars, scientists believe that there could be alien civilizations thousands or even millions of years older than ours who are already well into their Level III, star-harvesting phase. By keeping an eye out for unusual galaxies with their prime stars ripped away, astronomers may be able to detect the presence of these advanced civilizations.\n\nThe search for advanced civilizations is an ongoing quest, and the concept of harnessing energy from distant stars offers a new perspective on the possibility of extraterrestrial life.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

{"pred": "Recent archaeological discoveries in East Africa have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have uncovered evidence of a significant shift in toolmaking and trading networks among early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This period marks the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, a time of great change and innovation in human history.\n\nThe discoveries, published in three papers in the journal Science, suggest that early humans in the region were responding to dramatic shifts in the climate, which led to unpredictable food sources and the need for greater mobility and resourcefulness. The researchers propose that this led to the development of smaller, more specialized tools, such as spearpoints and blades, which were made from obsidian and other exotic materials brought from distant locations.\n\nThe use of obsidian, a volcanic glass, is particularly significant, as it indicates a level of technological sophistication and the ability to transport and process raw materials over long distances. The team also found evidence of the extraction of pigments, including red and black rocks, which were likely used for symbolic purposes, such as painting or decorating tools.\n\nThese findings challenge the long-held view that modern human behavior and technology emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago, and instead suggest that these developments occurred much earlier, in Africa. The researchers argue that the evolution of complex behaviors, such as symbolism, innovation, and art, was a gradual process that occurred over hundreds of thousands of years, rather than a sudden \"human revolution.\"\n\nThe discoveries also highlight the importance of social networks and exchange between different groups of early humans, which allowed for the sharing of knowledge, resources, and technologies. This is evident in the presence of obsidian and other exotic materials, which were brought from distant locations and used to create tools and other objects.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior. They suggest that early humans were capable of complex thought and innovation, and that these abilities were not unique to modern humans, but rather a gradual development that occurred over time.\n\nIn addition, the discoveries at Olorgesailie provide a unique window into the lives of early humans, revealing a complex and dynamic society that was capable of adapting to changing environments and developing new technologies. The findings also highlight the importance of considering the African continent as a whole, rather than focusing on a single region or species, in order to gain a more complete understanding of human evolution and development.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

The airline has reduced the number of boarding lanes from five to two, with elite and priority passengers in groups 1 and 2 boarding through lane 1, and customers in groups 3, 4, and 5 using lane 2. The new process also includes push notifications for passengers who have the airline's mobile app, alerting them when boarding starts.\n\nThe new boarding process is part of a larger effort to improve the passenger experience and reduce congestion at gates. United has been testing different boarding procedures since last fall and has implemented the new system at Los Angeles International Airport since February. The airline has also introduced a new two-lane, color-coded process that will handle a staggered boarding call, with lane 1 designated as the \"blue\" lane for priority passengers and lane 2 as the \"green\" lane for groups 3, 4, and 5.\n\nThe new boarding process is a response to customer feedback, which identified the boarding process as one of the top areas for improvement. United's vice president of Global Operations Strategy, Planning and Design, Sarah Murphy, stated that the airline listened to customer and employee feedback and tested various processes on thousands of flights to find a better boarding process that reduces waiting time, improves communication, and recognizes Premier customers.\n\nThe new boarding process is not the only change United has made to improve the passenger experience.

Nine of the protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct and released on bail hours later.

{"pred": "**Groundbreaking Surgery Gives Boy Born Without Ears a New Lease on Life**\n\nNine-year-old Kieran Sorkin, born without fully formed ears and deaf, has undergone a pioneering procedure at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. The surgery, led by consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved creating a pair of ears from Kieran's own ribs. The procedure, which took six hours, involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's chest and shaping it into frameworks for his ears. The new ears were then grafted onto Kieran's head, with the help of a vacuum to shape the skin to the contours of the new ear.\n\nKieran, from Hertfordshire, was born with bilateral microtia, a rare condition affecting one in 100,000 babies. He had previously undergone several operations and was fitted with a hearing aid, which allowed him to hear 90% of sounds. However, he still struggled with low self-esteem due to his appearance.\n\nThe surgery was primarily cosmetic, but it has brought significant psychological benefits to Kieran. His father, David Sorkin, said that Kieran's confidence has improved exponentially, and his performance at school has also improved. Bulstrode noted that the surgery can change a child's whole trajectory in life, and Kieran's reaction to his new ears was a \"wow\" and a giggle, despite the pain from the operation.\n\nKieran's mother, Louise, expressed her desire for her son to be accepted like everyone else, and the surgery has given him the opportunity to wear sunglasses and earphones like his friends. The procedure is not without its challenges, as Kieran will need a second operation in six months to make his ears stand out from the scalp more.\n\nAdvances in tissue engineering may one day make the current procedure obsolete. Scientists at the University College London Institute for Child Health are working on creating stem cells from patients' fat tissue to grow new ear frameworks and other skeletal structures. This approach would be far less invasive than the current method of harvesting a child's rib cartilage. While this research is still in its early stages, it holds promise for the future of reconstructive surgery.\n\nFor now, Kieran's new ears have given him a new lease on life, and he is already delighted with the result. His story serves as a testament to the power of medical innovation and the importance of self-acceptance.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

The law requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain, all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, despite being aware of the risks involved. Gibson, however, denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe case has sparked concerns among guitar builders and dealers, who fear that the Lacey Act is burdensome and retroactive.

The ocean, which existed around 4.5 billion years ago, was approximately a mile deep in some areas and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. This finding, published by NASA scientists, challenges the previous understanding of Mars as a planet with only occasional and short-lived water presence.\n\nThe research team used infrared telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere and analyze the isotopic composition of water molecules. They found that the water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, indicating that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past. By calculating the concentration of deuterium, the scientists estimated that the ancient ocean would have covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters, but it likely pooled into a deeper ocean in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the Red Planet. The longer water persisted on Mars, the more likely it is that it provided a habitable environment for life to originate or proliferate. While it is still unclear whether life existed on Mars, the evidence suggests that the planet was once warm and wet, making it a more promising place for life to have gained a foothold.\n\nThe study also found that the ordinary hydrogen in Martian water has been leaking into space over time, leading to a higher proportion of deuterium in the planet's water. This process, combined with the analysis of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, allowed the scientists to estimate the amount of water that once existed on the planet. The results suggest that the ancient ocean would have been at least 137 meters deep if it had covered the entire planet evenly, but it likely formed an ocean in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe findings have been supported by other studies, including one that used the Viking 1 orbiter to observe the Martian atmosphere and another that analyzed the chemical composition of the atmosphere's vapor.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has dismissed appeals from both companies, sending the case back to the EU's trademark office for further review.\n\nThe dispute began in 2002 when Nestlé applied for a trademark for the shape of the four-fingered wafer bar, which was granted in 2006. However, Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury, objected to the decision, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be trademarked. The case has been ongoing for over a decade, with various appeals and court rulings.\n\nThe ECJ's latest decision means that the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must review its 2012 decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark on the shape of the KitKat. While the ruling does not cancel the trademark, it does not provide the protection that Nestlé had sought. The outcome leaves open the possibility that the EUIPO could preserve protection for the KitKat shape, but only if new evidence is presented to show that the shape is distinctive to people in more EU countries.\n\nThe case has significant implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The dispute has also been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has featured in the UK's Brexit debate, with some arguing that EU courts have failed to defend a beloved British treat.\n\nThe ruling does not affect the trademark status of the KitKat brand name, but it does have implications for the shape of the product. The case is not the only example of a trademark dispute between the two companies, as they have also clashed over the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.\n\nThe decision is seen as a victory for Mondelez, but it is not the end of the road for Nestlé. The company has stated that it believes the EU trademark office will side with them, and they may reapply for the trademark with stronger evidence. The case highlights the complexities of trademark law and the challenges of protecting iconic brand shapes and designs across different markets.\n\nIn related news, the shape of Toblerone, another iconic chocolate brand owned by Mondelez, was registered as a trademark in 1998 but was challenged by a British retailer, Poundland, which designed an off-brand version of the product.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex, may not have roared like they do in movies, but instead made sounds similar to those of birds. According to researchers, the T. rex's roar, as depicted in films like \"Jurassic Park,\" is a fictional creation of sound designers, who used a combination of animal sounds, including baby elephant cries, tiger chuffs, and alligator gargles, to create the iconic sound.\n\nIn reality, scientists believe that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to those of birds, such as the cooing of a dove or the mumble of an ostrich. This is based on a study that analyzed the vocalizations of modern birds and found that many species, particularly those with larger body sizes, use a type of vocalization called closed-mouth vocalization. This type of vocalization involves pushing air into an esophageal pouch rather than exhaling through the open beak, resulting in lower-pitched, quieter sounds.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, found that closed-mouth vocalization has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, and that dinosaurs may have used closed-mouth vocalization in a similar way.\n\nGary Rydstrom, a sound designer who worked on the original \"Jurassic Park\" film, has also shed light on how he created the iconic dinosaur sounds. Rydstrom revealed that he used a variety of animal sounds, including tortoise mating calls, horse breathing, and goose hisses, to create the sounds of the velociraptors, T. rex, and other dinosaurs.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and communication. While we may never know exactly what dinosaurs sounded like, the research suggests that they may have been more bird-like than we previously thought. The study's authors hope to continue their research, integrating information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to gain a better understanding of the sounds that extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors may have produced.\n\nIn summary, the study suggests that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to those of birds, and that closed-mouth vocalization may have been a common behavior among archosaurs. While we may never know exactly what dinosaurs sounded like, the research provides a new perspective on the behavior and communication of these fascinating creatures.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

His lawyers argue that the trial should have been held outside of Boston due to widespread outrage and publicity surrounding the 2013 bombing, which killed three people and injured over 260. They claim that jurors would have been exposed to prejudicial media coverage and survivor stories on social media, making it impossible for Tsarnaev to receive a fair trial.\n\nThe appeal also cites a recent Supreme Court ruling that questions the definition of a \"crime of violence,\" which was applied to Tsarnaev's actions.

The bank has been fined $185 million for creating millions of fake accounts, and Warren accused Stumpf of \"gutless leadership\" for not taking responsibility for the scandal. She also criticized the bank's practice of cross-selling, which she said was a way to increase stock prices and profits for executives like Stumpf, who made $19.3 million in annual compensation in 2015. Warren's comments came as the bank's stock price dipped, and she emphasized the need for accountability in the financial industry, stating that executives should face jail time for presiding over massive frauds.\n\n**Trump to Recognize Jerusalem as Israel's Capital**\n\nUS President Donald Trump is expected to announce that he will recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a decision that has been met with criticism from world leaders. The move is seen as a compromise, as Trump had previously pledged to move the US embassy to Jerusalem, which would have sparked an even greater international backlash. The decision is expected to be met with violent protests, and the Palestinian representative to the UK has called it the \"kiss of death\" to the peace process.

Despite extensive searches, the plane's fate remains unknown. However, statisticians and experts are using Bayesian statistics, a mathematical technique developed by 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, to help locate the missing plane.\n\n**Bayesian Statistics: A Powerful Tool**\n\nBayesian statistics is a method of analyzing data and making predictions based on probability. It allows experts to update their estimates of the probability of finding the plane in any given location, taking into account new information and evidence. This approach has been used successfully in previous searches, including the location of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009.\n\n**The Air France Flight 447 Search**\n\nIn 2009, Air France Flight 447 disappeared while flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. Despite finding debris, the plane's wreckage was not located until 2011, two years later. Statisticians from Metron Inc, led by Colleen Keller, used Bayesian statistics to help locate the plane. They analyzed historical data, assessed the likelihood of various scenarios, and created a probability map to guide the search. Although the initial search was unsuccessful, the team made a second attempt, adjusting their model to account for the possibility that the black box and voice recorder were not emitting a signal. This time, they found the plane.\n\n**The Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 Search**\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is more complex due to the lack of data and the changing circumstances of the disappearance. The plane's communication systems were shut off, and the cause of the disappearance is still unknown. Bayesian statisticians are being used to help locate the plane, but the search is challenging due to the vast area to be searched and the unpredictable ocean currents.\n\n**Challenges and Limitations**\n\nWhile Bayesian statistics has been successful in previous searches, it is not a guarantee of success. The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is a complex and difficult task, and it is possible that the plane may never be found. Even if debris is found, it may not provide a clear indication of the plane's location. Colleen Keller, the statistician who helped locate Air France Flight 447, believes that it is likely that the plane is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and may never be found.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is a complex", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time. They changed their findings, and presto, the plane was found.

Egeland, who was already serving a 10-year federal prison term for his involvement in a mortgage fraud case, orchestrated a plot to delay his prison sentence by staging a shooting that resulted in the amputation of his left leg.\n\nOn July 31, 2014, Egeland directed his 17-year-old son, Rylan, to shoot him in the leg with a shotgun in a bid to delay his prison sentence and collect on a disability insurance policy he had applied for just seven days earlier. The shooting was staged to make it appear as though Egeland was a victim of assault, and he even called 911 claiming he was attacked after stopping to help a pregnant motorist.\n\nEgeland's scheme was quickly detected, and he was subsequently charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and interstate failure to pay child support. In a sentencing memo, Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Bradford described Egeland as a \"menace to society\" who has been on a crime spree since 2004, motivated by greed and recklessness. Bradford also noted that Egeland's actions caused \"unimaginable\" psychological and emotional destruction to his minor child.\n\nEgeland's defense lawyer, Ryan O'Connor, argued that his client was suffering from a \"perfect storm\" of medical and mental health issues and financial difficulties at the time of the shooting, and that he was anxious about reporting to prison. However, the judge ultimately rejected this argument and added three years and 10 months to Egeland's sentence.\n\nEgeland was also ordered to pay $90,011 in child support and was urged to seek mental health treatment and counseling while in prison.

Back in 2009, Egeland was co-owner of an Oregon development company that defrauded banks out of $20 million in loans that he and a partner used to fund a lavish lifestyle.

Huang, an Apple engineer, died in the accident. The vehicle was on Autopilot mode with adaptive cruise control set to minimum at the time of the collision.\n\nAccording to Tesla, the crash was severe due to the condition of the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier designed to reduce impact into a concrete lane divider. The barrier had been crushed in a prior accident 11 days before Huang's fatal crash and had not been replaced. Tesla stated that this level of damage to a Model X has never been seen in any other crash.\n\nHuang's family reported that he had complained to the dealership about the Autopilot system veering towards the same barrier on multiple occasions, with the issue occurring 7-10 times. The family took the vehicle to the dealership, but the issue could not be duplicated.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the accident, and Tesla has released a statement regarding the incident. The company emphasized that Autopilot does not prevent all accidents but makes them less likely to occur, citing data that shows a significant reduction in crash rates. Tesla also stated that Autopilot makes the world safer for vehicle occupants, pedestrians, and cyclists.\n\nIn a separate incident, a woman was killed by an Uber autonomous vehicle in Tempe, Arizona, leading to the suspension of Uber's license to test autonomous vehicles on public roads.

The second full moon in a month is called a blue moon.\n\n**What is a Supermoon?**\nA supermoon is a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear 14% larger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon.\n\n**What is a Total Lunar Eclipse?**\nA total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's light from reaching the moon. This causes the moon to darken and take on a reddish hue, earning it the nickname \"blood moon.\"\n\n**When and Where to See the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Eclipse**\nThe total lunar eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, on January 31, 2018.

They also expressed shock and disappointment that police sources had leaked the theory to the media.\n\nBarry Sherman was a renowned workaholic who had amassed a vast fortune of $4.77 billion, making him the 15th richest person in Canada. He founded Apotex in 1974 and had created hundreds of jobs in the city of Toronto. His wife, Honey, was a dedicated philanthropist who was involved in various charitable causes, including education, healthcare, and the Jewish community.\n\nFriends and colleagues of the couple have described them as kind, generous, and committed to their family and community. They have been remembered for their contributions to the city of Toronto and their dedication to their work and philanthropy.\n\nA makeshift memorial was set up outside the couple's home, where a steady stream of neighbors, Apotex workers, and well-wishers dropped off flowers in honor of the Shermans. The couple's friends and colleagues have been left reeling from the news, with many expressing shock and disbelief at the circumstances of their deaths.\n\nAs the investigation continues, police are still searching for answers and have not yet confirmed any suspects or motives.

The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later.

The elections, which began in November, are the first since Mubarak's departure in February 2011.\n\n**Islamist Groups Expected to Consolidate Gains**\n\nIslamist groups, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, are expected to consolidate their gains in the final round of voting. The Brotherhood has already taken the lead in the first two rounds, winning around 40% of the seats allocated by party voting. The party's leader, Essam el-Erian, has stated that while a clear majority is possible, it would be difficult to achieve.\n\n**Prosecutors Accuse Mubarak of \"Tyrannical Rule\"**\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors in Mubarak's trial accused the ousted leader of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last decade of his rule to ensure his son, Gamal, would succeed him. The trial, which resumed on January 2, 2012, is expected to last for three days, with the prosecution presenting its case against Mubarak and 10 other defendants, including his two sons and his security chief.\n\n**Mubarak's Trial and the Military's Role**\n\nMubarak faces charges of complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the crackdown on the popular uprising that forced him out of office in February 2011. The trial has been bogged down in procedural matters, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding judge be removed. The military, which has been in power since Mubarak's ouster, has said it will not cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June.\n\n**Economic Growth Slows**\n\nThe unrest in Egypt has led to a slowdown in economic growth, with foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% to $20.2 billion in the first 11 months of 2011. The benchmark EGX 30 stock index lost 49% last year, making it the third-worst performer among world markets tracked by Bloomberg.\n\n**Final Results Uncertain**\n\nThe final results of the parliamentary elections remain uncertain, as the military rulers have yet to spell out the formula for allocating seats among parties according to their share of the vote.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

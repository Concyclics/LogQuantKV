A study by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, published in Infection and Immunity, reveals that MRSA becomes more aggressive and difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. The smoke exposure causes MRSA to alter its cell walls, making it more resistant to the body's immune defenses, such as reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides. The bacteria can adhere better to human cells, facilitating their invasion.\n\nThe study not only focuses on traditional cigarettes but also examines e-cigarette vapor, which was found to have a lesser impact on bacterial resistance compared to cigarette smoke.

Researchers from Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Pavia, led by Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth using a combination of live subject tests and simulations. Their study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, challenges the authenticity of the shroud by revealing inconsistencies in the blood flow patterns.\n\nThe researchers found that the bloodstains on the shroud do not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion scenario. The bloodstains on the left hand, forearms, and the spear wound in the torso suggest different positions, with some angles being impossible for a body in a crucified state. The bloodstains on the back of the hand and the forearm do not align with the angles expected for a hanging or crucified individual, and the blood flow from the spear wound does not match the shroud's depiction.\n\nThe investigation also highlights that the lumbar stains, which are thought to represent blood from the lower back, cannot be replicated, further casting doubt on the authenticity of the shroud. While the shroud's age, weave, and pollen analysis support its Middle Ages origin, the forensic analysis suggests that the image may be a product of a 14th-century artistic representation rather than a historical artifact.\n\nThe findings, though not definitive, add weight to previous claims that the Shroud of Turin might be a fake, and the mystery surrounding its origins remains unsolved.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Lumos aims to eradicate the practice of separating children from their families and advocate for family-based care.\n\nInstitutionalization causes significant harm to children's development, leading to long-lasting negative impacts on their health, education, and ability to form healthy relationships. Research shows that children in institutions are more prone to abuse, neglect, and lifelong challenges.

Named after the Mandarin words for \"rainbow\" and \"big crest,\" the dinosaur had vibrant feathers, particularly on its head, neck, and chest, which displayed colors similar to those of hummingbirds. The feathers, analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, revealed melanosomes, the pigment-producing structures, suggesting a rainbow-like appearance. Caihong had a theropod body, with a Velociraptor-like skull and crested head, but its feathers indicate it may have been capable of gliding or using them for display purposes, possibly attracting mates.\n\nThe dinosaur's feathers were not only colorful but also had asymmetrical vanes, resembling those of birds, hinting at the evolution of feather function for aerodynamic purposes. Caihong's feathers were diverse, ranging from linear and pennaceous to sinuous, with some resembling alula, a possible precursor to flight in birds. The dinosaur's small size and relatively short bony tail suggest a potential role in gliding or display, rather than flight.\n\nThe fossil's preservation allowed scientists to infer the dinosaur's lifestyle, suggesting it lived in forests and may have been a predator, hunting small mammals and lizards. The presence of feathers on its head and crest, as well as the discovery of iridescent feathers in other Tiaojishan theropods, implies that colorful plumage may have been more widespread than previously thought.\n\nThe study also shed light on the diversity of feather patterns and colors in early paravians, with Caihong occupying a unique position in the fossil record. While the dinosaur's feathers were primarily black, the presence of iridescent structures suggests a potential connection to the origin of avian colors and the evolution of display traits.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Caihong juji pushes the boundaries of our understanding of dinosaur diversity and the potential roles of feathers in prehistoric life, highlighting the importance of coloration in communication and display among these ancient creatures.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

However, the tax faced significant opposition due to its regressive nature, with critics arguing that it led to price hikes, loss of revenue, and migration of consumers to neighboring areas where the tax was not in effect. Retailers, including Costco, responded by prominently displaying the tax impact and directing customers to untaxed locations. The tax exempted beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, causing Starbucks to refuse the tax.\n\nSimilar to Seattle, Cook County in Illinois repealed its soda tax within two months due to public backlash, with opponents from various groups uniting against it. The tax's effectiveness in improving public health was questioned, and concerns were raised about its regressive nature, affecting low-income individuals disproportionately.\n\nSeattle's tax led to a spike in prices, with a case of Gatorade increasing by over 64% due to the tax. The tax's defeat in Seattle mirrors the experience of other cities like Philadelphia, where consumers shifted their purchases outside city limits to avoid the tax.\n\nIn contrast, the Seattle government's attempt to modify consumer behavior through pricing has faced criticism, with calls for consistency in taxation and a focus on public health education rather than price manipulation. The tax's impact on local businesses, like Costco, has been substantial, with sales declining and customers seeking alternatives outside the city.\n\nThe debate over soda taxes highlights the tension between public health goals and unintended consequences, as well as the challenge of implementing policies that address complex issues without alienating a wide range of stakeholders. While some argue for a more comprehensive approach to promoting healthier lifestyles, the current wave of soda taxes has shown mixed results and prompted calls for clearer messaging and alternative revenue-generating strategies.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

After being identified by a viewer on the show, the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office confirmed her whereabouts and removed her from the list. Rebekah's case highlights the issue of missing persons reports, with Humboldt County having a disproportionately high number of such cases, despite the possibility of some reports being due to transient workers in the cannabis industry or mistaken entries.\n\nThe county has a high rate of missing persons reports, with the sheriff's office attributing this to the lenient reporting policy and the transient nature of the cannabis industry. The Humboldt 35, a group of 35 people listed on the attorney general's website, include cases that date back to 1977, with varying degrees of resolution. Some cases remain open, like that of Mitchell Hernandez, a 47-year-old man who disappeared with a gun and no known contact since then.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office receives numerous reports, including children in foster care, which contribute to the high number of missing persons cases. The majority of these reports are resolved quickly, but some, like the cases involving runaways or suspicious circumstances, persist.

When a pediatrician diagnosed the baby as dehydrated and needing immediate medical attention, Markham was instructed to bring the baby to the hospital, but she refused, insisting on seeking a second opinion from a vegan doctor.\n\nCasselberry police were alerted through a tip, leading to the baby's rescue and subsequent hospitalization.

The study, based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data, found that younger patients tend to be diagnosed with more advanced stages of the disease, requiring more aggressive treatment options such as surgery and radiation therapy. Although younger patients have a higher likelihood of advanced cancer, they also experienced slightly longer survival without recurrence due to earlier detection and treatment.\n\nThe study highlights the need for earlier screening, as younger patients are being diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a higher rate than previously thought. This shift in demographics prompts a call for reevaluation of current guidelines, which currently recommend screening at age 50. Some experts suggest that family history and certain risk factors may warrant earlier screenings, particularly for those with a genetic predisposition.\n\nThe increasing number of colorectal cancer cases in younger adults raises questions about environmental factors and the need to investigate potential causes. Smoking, obesity, lack of physical activity, and poor diet are cited as risk factors. While the exact reasons for the rise in younger patients are not fully understood, the findings emphasize the importance of recognizing and addressing colorectal cancer symptoms in this age group.\n\nDr. Samantha Hendren's research underscores the need for healthcare providers to be vigilant for signs of the disease, such as anemia, changes in bowel habits, and dark blood in stool, in patients regardless of age. The study's limitations include the absence of family history data and the possibility of selection bias in treatment decisions.\n\nThe debate on whether to alter screening guidelines to accommodate this demographic shift is ongoing, with some experts suggesting that more research is needed to determine the optimal age to start screenings and the potential impact on public health.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The shelter contains sophisticated tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, suggesting a timeline earlier than previously believed.\n\nThe presence of fireplaces, blackened rock, and the presence of bone and stone artefacts push back the timeline of human settlement in the region, potentially indicating an earlier colonization than the commonly accepted 50,000 years ago. The excavation, involving hand excavation and careful documentation, uncovered a total of 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, including the first reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna.\n\nThe site also reveals advanced technologies, such as the use of ochre and the development of bone and stone tools, suggesting local innovation rather than reliance on imported knowledge. The discovery challenges the perception of Indigenous Australians as having a simpler material culture, as the findings indicate a more complex and rapid expansion into the arid interior.\n\nRadiocarbon dating of charcoal and eggshell fragments, along with optical dating techniques, have been employed to establish a chronology ranging from 49,000 to 46,000 years ago. This discovery supports the theory that humans reached the arid zone earlier than previously thought, possibly due to more favorable climatic conditions at the time.\n\nThe site's significance extends beyond its age, as it questions the role of humans in the extinction of megafauna, with evidence of coexistence and hunting. The Adnyamathanha people, local to the area, have a cultural connection to the site, as witnessed by the elders' stories and the presence of their rock art.\n\nThe discovery, published in Nature, contributes to a revised understanding of Australia's prehistory, challenging Eurocentric views on the sophistication of early human societies in the region.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, proposes that civilizations at Type III stage would actively capture energy from distant stars due to the expanding universe's isolation caused by dark energy. To achieve this, they would potentially employ Dyson spheres or other mega-structures, such as solar-powered satellites, to harvest stars' energy and maintain their energy supply.\n\nOlaf Stapledon's science fiction and physicist Freeman Dyson's theories inspired by these ideas suggest that advanced civilizations would create massive energy-harvesting structures like Dyson spheres or statites, which would surround stars and capture their energy. These structures could be detected by their waste heat or unusual light signatures, such as a dominance of longer wavelength radiation in the galaxy's spectrum.\n\nThe presence of alien civilizations could be inferred from their impact on nearby stars, like rings of statites or the manipulation of starlight. However, current human technology is far from achieving such monumental projects, with Earth estimated to be at around Type 0.7 on Kardashev's scale.

Researchers, using data from three papers published in Science, suggest that dramatic shifts in East African climate around 320,000 years ago may have driven advancements in toolmaking and the emergence of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. The excavated Middle Stone Age tools, the oldest of their kind, indicate a transition from simpler handheld cutting tools to more specialized, smaller implements like spearpoints and blades. These changes are attributed to the need to adapt to unpredictable food sources due to shifting landscapes, possibly leading to increased mobility and trade among hominid populations.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya provides evidence of long-distance contacts and trading, with obsidian tools sourced from afar and red pigment suggesting social organization. While it is uncertain if Homo sapiens or a related species created these tools, the development of specialized tools and the exchange of resources imply a level of sophistication unseen before. The timing aligns with the emergence of Homo sapiens, suggesting that environmental fluctuations played a crucial role in shaping their evolution.\n\nThe study also highlights the potential for climate-driven behavioral changes, as evidenced by the gradual downsizing of tools over time, eventually giving rise to the Middle Stone Age tools. However, the exact timeline and makers of these tools remain a mystery due to gaps in the archaeological record. Climate shifts, coupled with the appearance of Homo sapiens, may have prompted the need for more adaptable and innovative tool use.\n\nThe discovery of Middle Stone Age tools predating previous estimates by tens of thousands of years challenges the notion of a single \"human revolution\" around 40,000-50,000 years ago.

But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

This ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, was comparable to the Atlantic Ocean on Earth and persisted for millions of years, providing a potentially habitable environment. The ocean's existence is inferred from maps of atmospheric water vapor, which show a high concentration of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, indicating extensive water loss over time.\n\nThe water, initially covering nearly half of Mars, was at least 137 meters deep, with the majority of it concentrated in the lower-lying areas. This discovery challenges previous beliefs about the planet's water history, suggesting a more consistent presence of liquid water than previously thought. The ocean's presence supports the possibility of early Mars being conducive to the evolution of life.\n\nThe water loss on Mars occurred primarily due to the thinning of the Martian atmosphere, causing the ocean to recede and eventually freeze, leaving behind the polar ice caps. The discovery of a substantial amount of water on Mars indicates that the planet was wetter and warmer in its youth than previously assumed, making it a more enticing target for the search for ancient or even extant life.\n\nIn addition to the ancient ocean, NASA's Curiosity rover has found evidence of standing water on Mars for 1.5 billion years, further suggesting a more habitable environment. Methane detection on Mars has raised questions about potential biological activity, although it could also be explained by geological processes.\n\nAs research continues, the possibility of past or present habitability on Mars grows, with upcoming missions like the Exomars rover set to explore the planet's potential for life in more detail.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water.

It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

Despite the film's glossy appearance and the undeniable chemistry between Smith and Robbie, the plot falls flat due to its absurdity, particularly in scenes involving extravagant heists and implausible resolutions.\n\nSmith's performance, while showcasing his charisma, lacks depth as he plays a role that requires more emotional complexity. The supporting cast, including B.D. Wong and Adrian Martinez, contribute some entertaining moments, but the film's reliance on Smith's suave persona and the absence of a compelling narrative make it a letdown.

The court ruled that Nestlé failed to prove the shape had distinctive recognition across all EU countries, requiring evidence in every member state, not just a significant part. This decision affects the protected status of Kit Kat's shape in Europe, potentially opening the door for competitors like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj to produce similar products without infringing on the trademark. The case highlights the need for a strong case of distinctiveness in all EU markets for a trademark to be upheld.\n\nThe Kit Kat shape has been a subject of legal disputes for years, with Nestlé initially obtaining a trademark in 2012, but facing challenges from Mondelez, which manufactures rival products like Cadbury's chocolate bars. The ECJ's ruling sets a higher standard for proving distinctiveness, requiring evidence of recognition in every EU country, not just some.\n\nIn addition to the Kit Kat shape, the case has broader implications for trademark law, with other companies like Lindt and Toblerone facing similar battles over their product shapes and designs. The outcome of these cases could shape the future of branding and intellectual property rights within the European Union.\n\nThe Kit Kat trademark saga has also been mentioned in the context of Brexit, with some arguing that a potential loss of EU protections could lead to increased competition from copycat products. However, the recent ruling suggests that the Kit Kat shape may no longer enjoy the same level of legal protection within the EU.\n\nOverall, the Kit Kat shape trademark battle has been a lengthy and costly affair for both Nestlé and Mondelez, with the possibility of further appeals and reconsiderations of the trademark status.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic image of the T. rex's roar, suggesting that the dinosaur likely didn't sound like the fierce, high-pitched creature portrayed in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" Scientists argue that the T. rex, along with other dinosaurs, may have produced sounds more akin to today's birds, such as cooing or a low, throaty mumble. These closed-mouth vocalizations, which are common in birds with large esophageal pouches, could have been used for mating displays or territorial defense. The study, published in the journal Evolution, identifies a possible connection between dinosaurs and birds in terms of vocalization, as both had the potential for closed-mouth sounds, despite differences in vocal cords.\n\nThe sounds in \"Jurassic Park\" were created using a combination of animal noises, including baby elephants, tiger grunts, and an alligator's gurgle, remixed to create cinematic effects. Velociraptors in the film, particularly during their mating calls, featured a mix of a tortoise's mating call and a goose's hiss, highlighting the creative process behind bringing dinosaurs to life.\n\nThe study also reveals that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are prevalent in birds with large bodies like doves and ostriches, may have evolved independently in dinosaurs, suggesting that some dinosaurs could have communicated with low-frequency, throaty sounds similar to those of ostriches or cassowaries. The lack of vocal cord evidence in dinosaurs means that their actual sounds remain largely speculative, but researchers speculate that they might have had air sacs and possibly a bird-like syrinx.\n\nThe Jurassic franchise, with its iconic dinosaur roars, relied on real-life animal recordings to create the illusion of prehistoric creatures. For instance, the T. rex's roar was a composite of baby elephant cries, while the raptors' menacing calls were influenced by goose vocalizations. The study underscores the mystery surrounding dinosaur sounds, as only a fraction of dinosaur genera have been discovered, leaving much of their vocal capabilities unknown.\n\nIn conclusion, while dinosaurs are often associated with loud, dinosauric roars, recent research suggests that their vocalizations might have been quite different, resembling the coos and grunts of birds.

The committee found that the Obama administration initially blamed the attack on an anti-Islam video, which was later contradicted by evidence suggesting it was a well-planned terrorist operation, not a protest.

However, obesity is a global issue affecting various countries, with no nation witnessing a decline in obesity rates over the past three decades. The study, which analyzed 188 countries, found that obesity rates are rising among men, women, and children worldwide, regardless of economic status. Developed countries like the US have higher obesity rates, while obesity coexists with poverty in many nations.\n\nThe report highlights that obesity affects 2.1 billion people globally, with 30% of the world's population now being either overweight or obese. Rates are particularly high in the Middle East and North Africa, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait topping the list for women, while New Zealand, Bahrain, and the US lead for men. The problem is not limited to developed nations; obesity is also affecting a significant portion of the population in developing countries, with rates doubling among children and adolescents.\n\nThe study attributes the rise in obesity to factors such as increased caloric intake, changes in diet, reduced physical activity, and altered gut bacteria. While obesity rates have slowed in some developed countries, they continue to accelerate in developing nations. Chronic health issues related to obesity, such as heart disease and diabetes, claim millions of lives annually.\n\nBoth global experts acknowledge the role of cheap, high-calorie foods and sedentary lifestyles in obesity. Efforts to combat obesity are lacking, with no country successfully reducing obesity rates over the past three decades.

The elections, which took place amidst ongoing trials for former President Hosni Mubarak, saw Mubarak's trial resume with prosecutors accusing him of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression. Mubarak's trial, which includes corruption and conspiracy charges, has raised questions about the role of the military in the post-Mubarak era. The election results, with Islamists likely to gain significant representation, come as economic growth slows due to political instability, with foreign currency reserves declining and stock market losses. The new parliament's composition could impact the balance of power and the formation of a new government, as the military faces calls to cede authority sooner than the planned June presidential elections. The trial of Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa, and other officials continues, with the prosecution seeking a harsh penalty for the former president. The outcome of the elections and Mubarak's trial will shape Egypt's political landscape and its transition to civilian rule.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house.

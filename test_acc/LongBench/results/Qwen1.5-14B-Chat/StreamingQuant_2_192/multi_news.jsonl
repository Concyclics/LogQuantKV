{"pred": "Recent research has revealed a concerning connection between cigarette smoke and the persistence and aggression of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke increases MRSA's resistance to antibiotics and impairs the effectiveness of the immune system in combating the infection. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes more adept at repelling reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it harder to kill. The bacteria adhere better to human cells, facilitating their invasion. A similar effect was observed with e-cigarette smoke, but the resistance increase was more pronounced in MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke acts as an alarm for MRSA, activating defense mechanisms that enhance its survival. The enhanced resistance persists for at least 24 hours, allowing MRSA to multiply and potentially cause more severe infections in smokers. The studies also highlight the dual impact of smoking on public health, as it not only harms the smoker but also aids the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing a greater threat to both individual health and the overall fight against infections.\n\nThe research underscores the importance of quitting smoking, as it contributes to the increased vulnerability of individuals to infections and the persistence of dangerous bacterial strains. These findings provide further motivation for public health campaigns to emphasize the detrimental effects of smoking on both smokers and the broader population, particularly in healthcare settings where MRSA is more prevalent.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a viral illness, such as enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), which was implicated in the 2014 outbreak.\n\nAFM cases have been reported in 17 states, with some physicians observing a possible correlation with EV-D68 or other enteroviruses. While no specific treatment has shown marked improvement, treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and possibly Prozac are being explored. The condition's cause remains uncertain, with the 2014 outbreak possibly linked to EV-D68, but the current surge does not necessarily indicate a recurrence of that specific virus, as enterovirus cases have not spiked like in 2014.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak saw 120 cases, mostly in children, while the number of cases in 2015 and 2016 has been higher. AFM is characterized by symptoms like fever, respiratory issues, and rapidly progressing paralysis, with recovery rates varying. Some children show partial recovery, while others remain paralyzed. The lack of a definitive cause and the rarity of the condition make it challenging for researchers to develop targeted treatments.\n\nParents and healthcare professionals are concerned about the potential rise in cases, with some experts suggesting that the condition, though rare, could be on the rise. The CDC is urging vigilance and monitoring, as well as maintaining good hygiene to prevent spread. The condition affects the spinal cord, and its cause remains a focus of research, with some studies suggesting a link to EV-D68.\n\nIndividual cases, like that of 3-year-old Carter Roberts and 6-year-old McKenzie Anderson, highlight the sudden onset and devastating impact of AFM on young patients and their families.

Researchers, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, employed Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to study the cloth's blood-like stains. Their study found that the patterns on the shroud do not match the expected flow of blood from a crucifixion scenario, with inconsistencies such as bloodstains on the back of the hand and forearm not aligning with the angles expected for a hanging or crucified individual. The researchers concluded that the stains are more consistent with a standing model, suggesting the shroud may be a medieval representation rather than a historical artifact.\n\nThe shroud's fame dates back centuries, with the Vatican considering it an icon rather than a religious relic. Radiocarbon dating places its origin between 1260 and 1390 CE. While the image on the cloth remains unexplained, the forensic analysis casts doubt on its authenticity, particularly the bloodstains, which do not conform to the expected patterns of a crucifixion.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The rebels aim for an independent state or strict Islamic governance in the predominantly Tuareg region of northern Mali, which they have taken control of, including cities like Timbuktu. The international community, led by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has imposed sanctions on Mali, threatening the country's stability and economy. The junta, citing the need to address security issues, has not contested the sanctions or committed to a return to civilian rule, despite calls for a swift transition to democracy.\n\nThe situation has led to a humanitarian crisis, with fuel shortages and the potential for a wider conflict. The coup has exposed vulnerabilities in the Malian military, and the rebels' control of the north could lead to an economic blockade and further division within the country. The international community, including UNESCO, is urging protection of cultural sites like Timbuktu, a UNESCO World Heritage site, as fighting threatens its unique architecture and historical significance.\n\nNegotiations between the junta and the MNLA are ongoing, but the rebels have not directly engaged with the military leadership, demanding recognition of their representatives.

Named after the Mandarin words for \"rainbow\" and \"big crest,\" the dinosaur had vibrant feathers, particularly on its head, neck, and chest, which displayed colors similar to those of hummingbirds. The feathers, analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, revealed melanosomes, the pigment-producing structures, suggesting a rainbow-like appearance. Caihong had a theropod body with a Velociraptor-like skull and crested head, but its feathers indicate a possible connection to early birds, with asymmetrical feathers suggesting a role in aerodynamics.\n\nThe dinosaur's feathers were not only colorful but also diverse, ranging from linear and pennaceous to sinuous and sinuous barbs. Its relatively short, robust dentary and the presence of iridescent feathers on its head and neck suggest a combination of display and possibly even flight capabilities, though the latter is debated. The dinosaur's small size and proportionally short limbs indicate it may have been a ground dweller, with a probable role in attracting mates or displaying during courtship.\n\nFeather preservation in Caihong is exceptional, with some feathers resembling those of modern birds, such as hummingbirds, and others suggesting a possible ancestral form of alula, a wing structure found in birds. The dinosaur's tail featured large rectrices, a characteristic of avialans, hinting at a possible connection to the origin of flight in birds.\n\nThe study also highlights the diversity of feather patterns and colors in early paravians, with Caihong's feathers occupying a unique position in the fossil record. While its feathers were primarily iridescent, the presence of black feathers and a lack of alula-like feathers in some regions suggests multiple functions for feather development.\n\nThe discovery pushes the understanding of dinosaur plumage and its potential roles in communication and display, potentially revealing a more colorful and complex world of prehistoric life.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

However, the tax faced significant opposition due to its regressive nature, with critics arguing that it led to price hikes, loss of revenue as shoppers moved to neighboring areas, and united diverse groups against it. Seattle's approach echoed that of Cook County, Illinois, which repealed its soda tax within two months due to public backlash.\n\nCostco, a major retailer, felt the impact of the tax, with prices doubling for some products like Gatorade. The tax's uneven application, exempting some beverages like those with milk as the primary ingredient, fueled debates about fairness and prompted calls for consistency. Starbucks, which was exempt, also faced criticism for not supporting the tax.\n\nThe tax's effectiveness in promoting healthier choices was questioned, as people responded by shopping outside the city. Seattle's tax hike led to a spike in prices, causing dissatisfaction among consumers and potentially hurting local businesses. Similar to Chicago's experience, Seattle's tax faced legal challenges and was seen as regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income households.\n\nIn contrast, Spokane, Washington, and other cities considered a soda tax, with concerns raised about potential impacts on local businesses. Advocates for the tax argue that it could deter unhealthy beverage consumption, but opponents emphasize the need for clearer messaging and a more equitable approach.\n\nOverall, the introduction of soda taxes in Seattle and elsewhere has sparked public debate, revealing the complexities of using pricing as a tool for public health goals, and the importance of considering unintended consequences and alternative strategies.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Cohen acknowledged the \"African American problem\" in the country, clarifying that it referred to racial tensions, while maintaining that Trump is \"colourblind\" and aware of the issue. The interview took place amidst a shake-up in Trump's campaign team, with the addition of Steve Bannon as campaign chief executive and Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager, following a dip in poll numbers.\n\nDuring the CNN interview, Cohen questioned the accuracy of the polls indicating Trump's low ratings, leading to a comical exchange where he repeatedly asked \"Says who?\" when presented with poll data.

This study, based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data from 1998 to 2011, found that younger patients are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced tumors, requiring more aggressive treatment options such as surgery and radiation therapy. Although younger patients tend to have more advanced cancer at diagnosis, they also experience slightly longer survival without recurrence due to earlier detection and treatment.\n\nThe study highlights the need for earlier risk assessment and screening for younger adults, as the proportion of colorectal cancers in this age group is expected to rise, with rectal cancer cases projected to reach one in four and colon cancer one in 10 by 2030. Researchers emphasize the importance of recognizing symptoms like anemia, unexplained changes in bowel habits, and blood in stool, which can indicate colorectal cancer in younger patients.\n\nWhile the study provides insights into the changing demographics of colorectal cancer, it also points out limitations, such as the lack of family history data and the need for consistent screening for high-risk individuals, including those with a family history of the disease. Some experts, like Dr. Chan and Dr. Weinberg, advise against universal age 50 screening guidelines, citing the low likelihood of finding cancer in young patients and the potential for unnecessary testing.\n\nThe increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger adults serves as a call to action for the medical community to adapt screening recommendations and improve early detection efforts, ensuring that young patients receive appropriate care and support for long-term survivorship.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

The site, found by chance when a colleague needed a toilet break, holds significance for its age and the artifacts it reveals about early human settlement in the region. The shelter contains sophisticated stone tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, suggesting a complex relationship between early humans and large animals like the giant wombat. The find pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the arid zone by around 10,000 years, challenging the conventional wisdom that people arrived in Australia later than previously thought.\n\nThe excavation methods employed were meticulous, with hand excavation, stratigraphic analysis, and careful documentation of artifacts and bone fragments. Optical dating techniques, including single-grain OSL and TT-OSL, were used to date the site, revealing a sequence of occupation between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago. The presence of ochre, bone tools, and evidence of megafauna interactions indicate advanced technology and lifestyle, including the oldest-known use of ochre in the region.\n\nThe discovery supports the theory that humans, not just climate change, played a role in the extinction of megafauna, as seen in the coexistence of human remains and megafaunal bones at the Warrayti site. This finding, published in Nature, contributes to a reevaluation of the adaptability and innovation of the first Australians, debunking the notion of a simplistic and backward material culture.\n\nThe site, located in the Flinders Ranges, is of immense historical and cultural significance, as it connects with the Adnyamathanha people's oral history and confirms the presence of the oldest continuous civilization on Earth.

{"pred": "This summary highlights the concept of galactic-scale energy acquisition and the search for advanced civilizations in the universe, as outlined in recent scientific papers and popular science discussions. Astrophysicist Dan Hooper's paper, based on Nikolai Kardashev's three-stage model, suggests that civilizations aiming to expand and secure energy resources would eventually move from harvesting their own planet's resources (Type I) to nearby stars (Type II) to combat the expanding universe's isolation. To achieve this, they would potentially construct Dyson spheres or other mega-structures, such as solar-powered satellites, to capture and harness energy from stars.\n\nHooper proposes that civilizations would prioritize capturing stars before they become inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of the universe caused by dark energy. This would involve constructing Dyson spheres or statite-like structures, which could be detected through unusual light signatures in the form of infrared radiation or specific wavelengths in the galaxy's energy output.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres, first introduced by Olaf Stapledon and later elaborated upon by Freeman Dyson, has become a key indicator of advanced civilizations. These structures, whether in the form of rings or clouds of solar satellites, would be a sign of a civilization's progression to Type II or III, depending on their energy-harvesting capabilities.\n\nWhile humans are currently at a relatively early stage, with Earth estimated to be around a 0.7 on Kardashev's scale, the possibility of encountering alien civilizations that have already reached the star-harvesting phase increases the urgency for humanity to explore and adapt its technology. The search for these advanced civilizations involves looking for anomalies in light signatures, such as unusual energy output or the presence of Dyson spheres, as they could indicate the presence of alien star manipulation.\n\nIn conclusion, the quest to dominate the universe and the search for extraterrestrial life are intertwined with the cosmic race against dark energy, as civilizations strive to secure energy sources before the expanding universe isolates them. As scientists and science fiction continue to ponder these concepts, the possibility of detecting signs of advanced alien activity becomes a focal point for both scientific inquiry and speculative storytelling.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "A series of groundbreaking discoveries in the field of paleoanthropology challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors. Researchers, using data from three papers published in Science, suggest that dramatic shifts in East African climate around 320,000 years ago may have catalyzed toolmaking advancements and trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. The excavated Middle Stone Age tools, the oldest of their kind, indicate a gradual transition from simpler tools to more specialized designs, possibly driven by the need to adapt to unpredictable food sources due to shifting landscapes. Obsidian tools, found at Olorgesailie, suggest long-distance trade and social networking among hominid populations.\n\nThe research also connects these changes to climate fluctuations, with alternating wet and dry periods influencing tool development. While it's uncertain if Homo sapiens or a related species created these tools, the evidence points to a shift in behavior that aligns with the emergence of our species. Climate-driven adaptations, such as smaller, more versatile tools and the exchange of resources like obsidian, played a crucial role in the development of Homo sapiens' success.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of social networking and resource acquisition during challenging times, which may have contributed to the rise of modern human traits. However, the exact timeline and the species responsible for the Middle Stone Age tools remain open questions, as no definitive fossils have been found at Olorgesailie. Genetic evidence supports the idea that modern human behavior and technological advancements began much earlier in Africa, predating the commonly assumed \"human revolution\" by tens of thousands of years.\n\nThe Olorgesailie discoveries, along with other sites across Africa, challenge the notion of a single, abrupt \"human revolution\" and emphasize a gradual progression of complex behaviors and innovations. As researchers continue to uncover evidence, the story of human evolution and adaptation unfolds as a continuous process, shaped by both environmental pressures and social interactions.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

This unprecedented decision recognizes the animals as legal persons, potentially paving the way for discussions about the rights and freedom of non-human primates. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP), which filed the lawsuit, argues that the chimps' cognitive and emotional complexity merits their release from captivity and relocation to a sanctuary.\n\nThe ruling comes amidst a broader debate about the erosion of habeas corpus, a fundamental legal principle that ensures individuals are not held indefinitely without due process. Passage 1 discusses how the Military Commissions Act of 2006 temporarily revoked habeas corpus rights for certain individuals labeled \"enemy combatants,\" including legal residents, raising concerns about a slippery slope towards a diminished legal system. The Guantanamo Bay detention facility is mentioned, where many detainees have faced challenges in obtaining fair hearings due to the lack of evidence against them.\n\nThe MCA's impact extends beyond Guantanamo, potentially affecting the treatment of non-citizens designated as \"enemy combatants\" outside the traditional legal system.

{"pred": "Recent studies have shed new light on the water history of Mars, revealing a massive ancient ocean that once covered a significant portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. Four billion years ago, Mars had a global ocean that was at least 20 million cubic kilometers in size, comparable to the Arctic Ocean on Earth, and reached depths of up to a mile. This extensive water body, which persisted for millions of years, suggests a warmer and wetter Mars than previously believed, with flowing rivers, lakes, and possibly even seas.\n\nThe research, conducted by NASA scientists using powerful infrared telescopes, found that the planet's ancient ice caps were enriched in deuterium, indicating substantial water loss over time. The maps of atmospheric water and its isotopic composition showed that Mars had lost an ocean equivalent to 137 meters deep globally, with some areas having even higher concentrations of heavy water, suggesting a more habitable environment in the past.\n\nThis discovery challenges earlier beliefs about the intermittent presence of water on Mars, as it indicates a more continuous and widespread water system. The presence of a large ocean raises the possibility of habitability and the potential for early life on the planet. The Exomars rover, scheduled for launch in 2022, will continue the search for signs of past or present life on Mars, with methane detection being a key focus.\n\nWhile the ancient ocean's existence supports the likelihood of a more habitable Mars, the exact extent and duration of this habitability remain open questions. Some scientists argue that the initial water content may have been even greater than estimated, due to the potential underestimation caused by the depletion of heavy hydrogen. As our understanding of Mars' watery past grows, the case for past or present-day habitability strengthens, although definitive evidence of life remains elusive.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The court ruled that Nestlé failed to prove the shape was distinctive enough across all EU member states, requiring evidence of recognition in every country, not just a significant part. This decision affects the protected status of Kit Kat's shape in Europe, potentially opening the door for competitors like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj to produce similar products without infringing on the trademark. The case highlights the need for a globally distinctive trademark, with the ECJ sending the matter back to the EU Intellectual Property Office for reconsideration.\n\nThe Kit Kat shape has been a subject of legal disputes for decades, with Nestlé initially applying for a trademark in 2002, leading to a lengthy battle with Mondelez, which owns Cadbury. The ECJ's ruling sets a precedent that a trademark must demonstrate distinctiveness across the entire EU, not just in some markets, challenging Nestlé's claim that the shape alone was enough to warrant protection.\n\nIn addition to the Kit Kat shape, the case has broader implications for trademark law, with other companies like Lindt facing similar challenges in protecting their iconic products. The outcome of the Kit Kat shape ruling could lead to further scrutiny of existing trademarks and potentially encourage more competition in the chocolate market.\n\nThe case has also been mentioned in the context of Brexit, with some arguing that a ruling against Kit Kat's shape could be seen as a symbolic loss for the UK, given the historical association of the chocolate bar with British brand Rowntree's.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic T. rex roar from popular culture, suggesting that the dinosaur likely didn't sound like the fierce, high-pitched creature portrayed in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" Scientists argue that the T. rex, if vocalizing, might have produced sounds more akin to those of birds, such as cooing or a low, throaty mumble. The study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzes the vocalizations of birds and crocodiles, revealing that closed-mouth sounds, like cooing, are associated with large-bodied dinosaurs and living birds like ostriches and doves. These findings imply that the dinosaur sound might have resembled an ostrich's low-pitched call.\n\nThe creation of dinosaur sounds in movies, like the T. rex's roar, largely relies on creative sound design. For instance, the iconic T. rex roar in \"Jurassic Park\" was a composite of various animal sounds, including a baby elephant, tiger, and an alligator, to create an artificial effect. The study suggests that dinosaurs may have communicated through closed-mouth vocalizations, similar to the cooing of birds, which are low-frequency and throaty.\n\nThe research also highlights the possibility of dinosaurs having bird-like vocal organs, with some evidence pointing to the presence of an esophageal pouch, enabling the production of low-pitched sounds. The study, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, explores the evolution of bird vocalizations, which could shed light on dinosaur vocalizations as well.\n\nIn Jurassic Park, the sound designer, Gary Rydstrom, combined various animal sounds to create the dinosaurs' roars and calls. Velociraptors' communication involved a mix of a tortoise's mating call and a goose's hiss, while the T. rex's roar was partly inspired by a baby elephant's sound, slowed down to create a more dramatic effect.\n\nWhile the exact dinosaur vocalizations remain a mystery due to lack of fossil evidence, the study suggests that dinosaurs might have had the ability to produce bird-like vocalizations, particularly in mating displays or territorial calls. The discovery of closed-mouth vocalizations in multiple bird lineages, including ostriches and cassowaries, implies that this trait could have evolved independently in dinosaurs.\n\nAs dinosaurs are often depicted in movies, the real-world implications of their vocalizations add a new layer of complexity to our understanding of these prehistoric creatures. With future research combining fossils, physiology, and sound modeling, scientists hope to uncover more about the sounds that filled the prehistoric world", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The committee disputes the administration's initial narrative, stating that the attack was not a result of a protest over an anti-Islam video, as initially claimed, but rather a well-planned terrorist operation. The report exposes discrepancies between the public statements and private communications of top officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who initially attributed the violence to a protest and later to a terrorist attack.\n\nThe report also accuses the Obama administration of providing a false story to the public, with key officials knowing that the Benghazi attack was not provoked by a protest but possibly linked to al-Qaeda affiliates. The controversy surrounding the handling of intelligence and the role of the video in shaping public discourse continues to be a focal point, with some suggesting that the administration intentionally misled the public. The report does not absolve the State Department of responsibility, as it acknowledges concerns about the security implications of uniforms and the lack of a stand-down order, but disputes the suggestion of a delay in sending help due to clothing considerations.\n\nThe release of the final GOP-authored report has reignited debate, with Democrats accusing the committee of partisanship and attempting to prevent accountability. Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, expresses disappointment in the process, stating that the report does not fundamentally change the understanding of the Benghazi attack, but adds nuance to the narrative.

{"pred": "The world is grappling with a widespread obesity crisis, with the United States leading the pack in absolute numbers (13% of the global obesity population, despite having only 5% of the world's population), according to a recent study published in the Lancet. However, obesity is not unique to the US; it is a global issue affecting men, women, and children across 188 countries surveyed. The obesity rate is rising worldwide, with no country witnessing a decline in the past three decades. Developed countries like the US have higher obesity rates, while obesity is also on the rise in developing nations, posing a challenge to public health.\n\nThe study highlights that obesity affects both rich and poor countries, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the US topping the list for men, while countries like Tonga and Kuwait have the highest obesity rates for women. In the US, approximately 33% of adults are obese, and 24% of girls and 22% of boys are overweight or obese. The situation is particularly alarming in the Middle East and North Africa, where obesity rates are alarmingly high.\n\nWhile obesity rates have slowed in some developed countries, they continue to accelerate in developing nations. The problem is linked to factors such as increased caloric intake, changes in diet, reduced physical activity, and the affordability of unhealthy food. The Lancet report suggests that obesity is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach, addressing not just hunger but also the availability and affordability of nutritious food.\n\nThe obesity epidemic is a major concern, contributing to chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Efforts to combat obesity are ongoing, with the World Health Organization launching a commission to address the issue among children globally, with a report due in 2015. The researchers emphasize the need for a comprehensive strategy to tackle this global health crisis.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

Not a single country has recorded a decline in obesity over the last 30 years. \"We hoped there would be some examples of success that you could latch onto,\" a study co-author says. \"But there's a complete lack of success stories in bringing down obesity.\" The study published in British medical journal the Lancet found that the Middle East and north Africa had seen the biggest weight gains, though the US still has the largest number of obese people, with 87 million of the world's 671 million obese people, reports Reuters. Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

The elections, held amidst ongoing trials of former President Hosni Mubarak, who was accused of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression, have raised concerns about the balance of power between the military council, the Brotherhood, and opposition forces. The outcome of the elections could impact the formation of a new government and the country's political landscape.\n\nAs the trial against Mubarak continued, the prosecution sought to hold him accountable for the deaths of protesters, describing him as a tyrant. Mubarak's son, Gamal, faces corruption charges, along with other family members. The military council's control is being challenged, with protests planned to mark the one-year anniversary of Mubarak's ouster.\n\nEconomic challenges loom, with Egypt's economy suffering from a decline in foreign currency reserves and a struggling stock market. The new parliament's composition could determine the extent of its power and the formation of a new government. The Brotherhood aims to form a coalition or unity government, while the military rulers' authority is expected to be tested.\n\nThe final round of voting saw the Brotherhood attempting to secure a majority, potentially allowing them to govern without a coalition.

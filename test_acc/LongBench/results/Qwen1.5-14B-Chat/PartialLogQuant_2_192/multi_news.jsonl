Despite his initial refusal to accept responsibility, he experienced a change of heart, feeling \"spiritual pain\" over the lives lost due to his invention. The letter, which was reportedly composed with the help of a priest, reveals Kalashnikov's struggle with the idea that his weapon could be held accountable for the deaths of others, even if they were enemies.

The AK-47, now estimated to have been produced in excess of 100 million units, has a complex legacy, symbolizing both protection and violence. President Vladimir Putin attended Kalashnikov's funeral, acknowledging the inventor's contributions to Russia's defense.\n\nThe letter's publication sheds light on the moral dilemma faced by a creator of such a significant weapon, particularly as Kalashnikov's conscience seemed to evolve with time.

Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke can significantly increase the resistance of MRSA to immune defenses, making it more difficult to eradicate. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes more resistant to reactive oxygen species produced by macrophages, which are essential for killing pathogens, and to antimicrobial peptides that disrupt bacterial cell walls. The bacteria also adhere better to human cells, facilitating their invasion.\n\nIn a separate study, e-cigarette vapor was found to have a similar effect on MRSA, although the resistance enhancement was less pronounced compared to cigarette smoke. These findings suggest that cigarette smoke acts as an alarm for MRSA, activating defense mechanisms that make it more resilient to the body's immune response. The researchers, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, emphasize that this discovery adds to the understanding of the detrimental impact of smoking on both human health and the persistence of superbugs in hospital settings.\n\nThese studies highlight the need for further public health efforts to discourage smoking, as it not only poses risks to smokers but also contributes to the global challenge of antibiotic resistance.

Microsoft's Xbox One, with its always-on Kinect, can respond to voice commands and even detect heartbeats, raising privacy concerns about constant listening even when the console is off. The company claims it listens only for specific cues like \"Xbox on\" and runs the system in a low-power state.

The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a viral illness, such as enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), which was implicated in the 2014 outbreak but the cause remains uncertain.\n\nAFM cases have been reported in 17 states, with some states experiencing a surge, including California, Massachusetts, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia. The condition is characterized by sudden onset of limb weakness, often starting with the arms and progressing to the legs, and in severe cases, paralysis. Treatment options are limited, with physical therapy and experimental treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and possibly Prozac being discussed. Recovery rates for children vary, with partial recovery for most, but full recovery is rare.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak, which saw 120 cases, was followed by a similar pattern in 2016, raising concerns among health experts. While the CDC is investigating the possibility of a connection to EV-D68, no definitive link has been established. The lack of a specific treatment highlights the urgency for more research into the condition's causes and potential therapies.\n\nParents and healthcare professionals are being alerted to monitor for AFM cases, with the CDC urging proper hygiene to prevent spread. The rarity of the condition, with only a few dozen cases annually, makes it difficult to predict the severity of the current outbreak. However, the rapid increase in reported cases prompts concern among medical professionals, who are calling for more information and understanding of the disease.\n\nAffected families, like the Roberts and Andersen clans, share stories of their children's sudden paralysis and the emotional toll the condition takes.

Researchers from Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Pavia, led by Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth using a combination of live subject tests and simulations. Their study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggests that the stains do not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion scenario.\n\nThe researchers found that the bloodstains on the Shroud are inconsistent with a crucified or hanging individual. The blood flow patterns, such as the angle and direction of trickles, do not align with the positions expected for a crucifixion, indicating that the stains were likely imprinted on a standing model. The spear wound on the shroud, for instance, produced a different pattern than what would be observed on a crucified person. The team also noted that the blood belt in the lower back, a feature often associated with a crucifixion, could not be replicated.\n\nWhile the shroud's radiocarbon dating places it within a timeframe compatible with the life of Jesus, the forensic analysis challenges its historical significance. The study adds to previous claims that the shroud may be a medieval creation, possibly intended as a didactic or artistic representation, rather than a genuine relic.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Forbes initially removed him from the Forbes 400 list due to discrepancies in his financial disclosures, but Ross maintained that the assets were transferred after the election and before his confirmation, to avoid disclosing them.\n\nRoss' history includes a lucrative career in private equity, particularly in the steel industry, where he orchestrated deals that led to the privatization of LTV and the acquisition of International Steel Group. His reputation for dishonesty dates back to at least 2004, with claims about his net worth that Forbes later found to be exaggerated. Ross' confirmation to the Trump administration was marred by questions about undisclosed lawsuits and his failure to disclose potential conflicts of interest.\n\nDuring his tenure, Ross faced scrutiny over his multimillion-dollar stake in a shipping company with ties to Vladimir Putin, raising concerns about potential conflicts.

The European Union, the US, and the Global Alliance for Children are driving progress in this area, but there is still a need for international support to eradicate institutionalization by 2050.\n\nThe #Letstalklumos campaign, launched by Rowling, aims to raise awareness about the issue and encourage action to prioritize family-based care over institutions. Rowling's commitment to Lumos as its president for life reflects her determination to see a world where children are kept with their families and not separated unnecessarily.

Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation.

Researchers found that pregnant women who took acetaminophen, a commonly recommended pain reliever, had a higher likelihood of their children being diagnosed with ADHD and related disorders. The study, conducted on 64,000 Danish children, observed a correlation between acetaminophen use and a 29% increased risk of ADHD, particularly when taken for extended periods. While the study does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship, it suggests that chronic or long-term use may be less advisable.\n\nExperts caution that the increased risk could be due to factors like flu infections or underlying genetic predispositions, rather than the drug itself. Pregnant women are advised to weigh the risks carefully, as acetaminophen is generally considered safe but can have potential side effects, especially at high doses. The study does not compare acetaminophen to other pain relievers like ibuprofen, and further research is needed to understand the exact risks.\n\nThe report highlights the complexity of brain development during pregnancy and the need for cautiousness when it comes to medications.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

This shift, as seen in a study of over 258,000 patients, highlights the need for reevaluating screening guidelines, as younger patients tend to present with more advanced disease and require aggressive treatment, including higher rates of surgery and radiation therapy.\n\nYounger patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer often experience more localized disease, leading to slightly better survival rates compared to older patients. However, the study emphasizes the importance of recognizing symptoms in younger adults, as they are at higher risk of advanced cancer presentations. The researchers urge healthcare providers to consider these findings when assessing and screening patients, regardless of age.\n\nThe study's implications extend beyond age 50, projecting that by 2030, rectal cancers will be diagnosed in almost one in four patients under 50 and colon cancers in one in ten. This shift calls for a conversation about earlier screening recommendations, potentially starting at a younger age, especially for those with family history or increased risk factors.\n\nWhile the exact reasons for the rising incidence in younger populations remain unclear, factors like lifestyle choices, environmental influences, and genetic predispositions may play a role. Some experts argue that earlier screening and increased awareness of symptoms are necessary to catch colorectal cancer in its early stages.\n\nHowever, experts caution against hasty changes in screening guidelines without further research, as the benefits and costs of earlier screenings need to be carefully evaluated.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The shelter contains sophisticated stone tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, suggesting a complex relationship between humans and large animals like the extinct giant wombat. The presence of these findings pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the arid zone to around 46,000 years ago, challenging the conventional belief that the first Australians arrived 50,000 years ago.\n\nThe excavation methods were meticulous, with hand excavation, grid systems, and careful documentation of artifacts and bone fragments. Optical dating techniques, including single-grain OSL and TT-OSL, were employed to date the site, providing a more accurate assessment of the timeline. The discovery includes the oldest-known use of ochre in Australia, as well as evidence of advanced technologies like bone and stone tools, and the potential for local innovation in material culture.\n\nThe site's location, far from the coast, implies that humans arrived in the arid interior earlier than previously thought, possibly around 49,000 years ago, despite the harsh climate.

Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev's three-step model of technological advancement, known as the Kardashev Scale, suggests civilizations progress from harnessing a planet's resources (Type I), to a star's energy (Type II), to a galaxy's resources (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, argues that as the universe expands due to dark energy, civilizations may need to capture energy from distant stars to avoid isolation. Advanced civilizations, like those hypothesized by Olaf Stapledon and Freeman Dyson, might construct massive structures like Dyson spheres or statite clouds to capture and harness energy from stars.\n\nHooper proposes that civilizations at the Type III stage would actively seek to secure energy from stars before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe. This could involve constructing solar-trapping megastructures like Dyson spheres, which would consist of millions of satellites collecting and transmitting energy back to their home planet or even using the stars' energy to propel themselves. The presence of such structures could be detected through unusual light signatures in galaxies, with harvested stars showing distinct radiation patterns.\n\nWhile humans are currently at a relatively early stage of technological development, the possibility of encountering civilizations far more advanced than ours, possibly millions or even billions of years older, is raised. These ancient civilizations might have already reached the stage of capturing and utilizing energy from distant stars. The search for these advanced extraterrestrial civilizations involves looking for signs of energy manipulation, waste heat, and the rearrangement of stars within galaxies.\n\nIn science fiction, concepts like Dyson spheres have long captured the imagination, serving as symbols of a civilization's technological prowess.

{"pred": "A series of groundbreaking discoveries in the field of paleoanthropology challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors. Researchers, using evidence from Olorgesailie, Kenya, have found that dramatic shifts in East African climate around 320,000 years ago may have driven advancements in toolmaking and the potential rise of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. Middle Stone Age tools, dated as far back as 300,000 years ago, suggest a transition from simpler, handheld tools to more specialized, long-distance traded items like obsidian-based spearpoints. These changes might indicate increased mobility, resource acquisition, and social networking among hominid populations.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin excavation revealed a gradual downsizing of tools over time, followed by a sudden shift to the Middle Stone Age tools, possibly influenced by climate fluctuations. While it is uncertain if Homo sapiens or a related species created these tools, the presence of obsidian from afar suggests long-distance trade. The discovery of pigment and the oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, around 160,000 years ago, imply a more complex and adaptable behavior in early humans.\n\nThe research aligns with genetic evidence placing the origin of Homo sapiens in Africa between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago. The Olorgesailie findings, along with similar observations in other parts of Africa, indicate that early Homo sapiens and their ancestors were innovating and adapting to changing environments, potentially leading to the development of modern human traits.\n\nClimate-driven behavioral changes, like the need for more efficient tools and trade, may have played a significant role in shaping the cognitive abilities and social structures of early humans. However, the exact connection between these innovations and the rise of Homo sapiens as a distinct species remains a topic of ongoing investigation, as the evidence from different regions shows a mix of behaviors across various hominid populations.\n\nIn summary, recent discoveries shed light on the complex interplay between climate, technology, and social organization in the early history of our species, challenging the traditional narrative of a single \"human revolution\" and emphasizing the gradual development of modern human characteristics throughout the Middle Stone Age.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

This is the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been granted this legal right, which usually protects human prisoners from unlawful detention. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP), which filed the case, argues that the chimps' cognitive and emotional complexity merits their release from captivity and relocation to a sanctuary. The case challenges the traditional boundaries between humans and animals, with NhRP seeking to expand legal personhood for non-human entities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006, which revoked habeas corpus rights for \"enemy combatants\" including Guantanamo Bay detainees and potentially legal residents labeled as such, remains a concern for civil liberties. The MCA allows for indefinite detention without trial, undermining the foundation of the legal system. The Supreme Court's decision in June 2007 to hear cases challenging Guantanamo detentions marked a potential restoration of habeas corpus rights, but the ongoing struggle to provide fair hearings for detainees highlights the erosion of due process.\n\nThe MCA's impact extends beyond Guantanamo, affecting non-citizens designated as \"enemy combatants\" anywhere in the world, raising questions about executive power and the balance of justice. The case involving Hercules and Leo showcases the potential for legal recognition of non-human animals, with the judge's order opening a door for future legal challenges on behalf of other primates and possibly other highly intelligent creatures like elephants, apes, and cetaceans.\n\nOverall, these developments highlight the ongoing debate over the limits of habeas corpus, the role of legal personhood for animals, and the need to protect fundamental rights in the face of executive overreach.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

The government claims that Gibson took steps to maintain a supply chain potentially linked to illegal timber harvests, as evidenced by emails in a court motion. Gibson denies these allegations, stating that all purchases from Madagascar were legal and that they stopped importing wood from the country after a coup. However, the company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, laments the lack of clear communication regarding the specifics of the violation.\n\nThe case has raised concerns among the guitar industry, with some, like Chris Martin of C.F. Martin Guitar Co., supporting the Lacey Act as a means to combat illegal logging. Martin believes the law is necessary, even if it affects vintage instrument collectors, as it aims to reduce unscrupulous practices. On the other hand, attorney Ronald Bienstock argues that the law's retroactivity poses challenges for guitar builders who may need to prove the legality of past wood purchases. The Environmental Investigation Agency's Andrea Johnson defends the law, emphasizing the importance of responsible sourcing and reducing illegal logging.\n\nThe raid on Gibson highlights the intersection of music and environmental regulation, as the company's reputation and business have been negatively impacted by the ongoing legal battle.

A team of NASA scientists, collaborating with the European Southern Observatory, analyzed the Martian atmosphere using powerful infrared telescopes to map the distribution of water and its heavy isotope form, deuterium. These maps indicate that an ancient ocean, potentially up to 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once existed, reaching depths of up to a mile, covering around 20% of Mars' surface, similar to the Atlantic Ocean on Earth.\n\nThe ocean's existence suggests a warmer and wetter Mars in its early days, with a climate capable of supporting long-lasting lakes, river deltas, and possibly even a global ocean. This finding contradicts previous beliefs about the sporadic presence of water on the planet. The water loss, primarily due to the thinning Martian atmosphere, led to the formation of a polar ice cap, with the remaining water equivalent to a global ocean depth of about 137 meters.\n\nThe study also highlights the potential habitability of Mars in the past, with some experts suggesting that the planet may have been conducive to the evolution of life. Notably, the Curiosity rover has detected methane in the Martian atmosphere, although its origin remains uncertain, with theories ranging from geological processes to possible biological activity.\n\nAs the search for life on Mars intensifies, upcoming missions like the Exomars rover will continue to explore the planet's past and present conditions, further refining our understanding of its water history and the possibility of past or present microbial life.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

This ruling affects not only Kit Kat but also competitors like Cadbury's Kvikk Lunsj, a Norwegian snack with a similar design. The ECJ's decision states that a product must be distinctive in all EU markets, not just a significant part, for a trademark to be valid. While Nestlé plans to appeal further, the case highlights the challenge of proving distinctiveness across the entire bloc.\n\nThe Kit Kat shape has been a subject of legal battles for decades, with rival Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, contesting the trademark. In 2012, the EU Intellectual Property Office initially upheld Nestlé's claim, but the case has seen numerous appeals and counter-arguments. The ruling emphasizes the need for a product to be recognizable in every EU country, not just some, for a trademark to be maintained.\n\nOther chocolate-related trademark disputes have also occurred, such as Cadbury's unsuccessful attempt to trademark a purple shade for its Dairy Milk bars and a legal battle over the shape of Toblerone bars. These cases demonstrate the ongoing complexities of trademark law within the EU, particularly for companies seeking to protect their brand identity.\n\nThe Kit Kat shape trademark case has implications beyond the chocolate industry, as it affects businesses operating in the EU and the ability to enforce trademark protections.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

The study, published in the journal Evolution, identifies a connection between closed-mouth vocalizations and large-bodied dinosaurs, such as ostriches and doves, which share an evolutionary trait for producing low-frequency sounds through an esophageal pouch.\n\nThe sounds in \"Jurassic Park\" were largely created using a combination of animal noises, with Velociraptors' calls inspired by mating tortoises, goose hisses, and even a baby elephant's roar. The iconic T. rex roar, on the other hand, was a cinematic invention, combining various animal sounds to create an intimidating effect.\n\nThe study also reveals that closed-mouth vocalizations, a feature found in birds and some dinosaurs, have evolved independently 16 times within the Archosaur group, including birds and crocodiles. The researchers speculate that these sounds, often associated with mating displays, might have been present in some non-avian dinosaurs as well, though no direct evidence exists due to the lack of fossil records of vocal organs.\n\nThe popularity of dinosaurs continues to captivate, but much about their actual sounds remains a mystery. While it is clear that dinosaurs likely made some form of vocalizations, the specifics, like whether they roared, hooted, or cooed, remain speculative. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the vocalizations of living birds to piece together what dinosaur sounds might have been like, given their potential similarities in vocal mechanisms.\n\nIn the realm of Jurassic Park, the sounds were crafted using a mix of real-life animal recordings, with Velociraptors' calls influenced by mating tortoises and the T. rex's roar borrowing from baby elephants. The study underscores the creative process involved in bringing dinosaurs to life on screen, often requiring artistic license to fill in the gaps of scientific knowledge.\n\nAs the field of dinosaur vocalization research progresses, it highlights the ongoing fascination with these ancient creatures, revealing that even the mighty T. rex may have had a more subtle, bird-like communication style than previously imagined.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The report highlights a concern among State Department officials during the attack that Marines' uniforms might hinder diplomacy, leading to discussions about the possibility of them wearing civilian clothing. The committee found that the Obama administration initially blamed the attack on an anti-Islam video, which was later determined to be a cover for a terrorist operation. The report disputes the administration's claims that the violence was a spontaneous protest, pointing to discrepancies between public statements and private communications, where officials acknowledged the involvement of al-Qaeda-affiliated groups and the lack of a protest as the primary cause.\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, criticized the committee's chairman, Trey Gowdy, for attempting to prevent accountability and transparency. Cummings argues that the report does not significantly alter the public's understanding of the attack, stating that the facts remain consistent: there was no stand-down order, no attempt to politicize the situation, and no evidence of gun trading. The report includes new criticisms of Hillary Clinton, then-Secretary of State, for not adequately addressing growing extremism in Libya and for providing a false narrative about the attack, initially blaming it on an anti-Muslim video.\n\nThe release of the report comes after months of partisan disputes and investigations, with both sides releasing their own accounts and analyses. Cummings' committee issued a rebuttal, emphasizing that the report does not change the established facts and criticizing the lack of access to information and evidence shared with Democrats.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration.

Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one. (Just to keep things in perspective, we'll point out that Look is the sort of magazine that also runs headlines like, \"Royal Bodyguard Warns: 'Kate Middleton's Baby Is In Danger!'\") In other news, Huffington Post notes that it's Cruise's 51st birthday."], "all_classes": null, "length": 790}
{"pred": "Billionaire couple Barry Sherman, 75, and his wife Honey, 70, were found dead in their Toronto mansion under suspicious circumstances, with police initially stating both died from \"ligature neck compression,\" suggesting a possible suicide-murder theory. However, their family disputes this, releasing a statement expressing shock and criticizing media reports. The couple, who owned Apotex Inc., a pharmaceutical giant, were known for their philanthropy and recent plans to travel to Florida. Police initially described the deaths as \"suspicious\" but were investigating it as a murder-suicide, a theory their children firmly reject. No signs of forced entry were found, and no note was left behind. The couple's absence from their planned vacation and the suddenness of their deaths have left friends and the community in disbelief. As the investigation continues, Toronto Mayor John Tory and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have offered condolences, highlighting Barry's significant contributions to the city's economy and the Jewish community. The Shermans' deaths have left a void in their tight-knit circle, with friends recalling their distinct personalities - Barry as a workaholic and Honey as a socialite and philanthropist. The couple's net worth was estimated at $4.77 billion, and they were actively involved in various charitable causes. The police investigation remains ongoing, with no official conclusion on the cause of their deaths.", "answers": ["The investigation into the mysterious deaths of a billionaire and his wife is now being led by homicide detectives, police say—suggesting the deaths of Barry and Honey Sherman were either murder-suicide or a double murder. Police, who have described the deaths as \"suspicious,\" revealed Sunday that the cause of death for both Shermans was \"ligature neck compression,\" a form of strangulation, the CBC reports. Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later.

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country held its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to lead, followed by the more conservative Nour party. The elections, held amidst ongoing trials for former President Hosni Mubarak, who was accused of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression, have raised concerns about the balance of power between the military, the Brotherhood, and other political factions. The military is facing pressure to cede power by June, but its role and the composition of the new parliament remain uncertain.\n\nEconomic challenges, including a 44% decline in foreign currency reserves and a 49% drop in the stock market, loom large in the backdrop of these developments. The Brotherhood aims to form a coalition government but has not ruled out an Islamist majority, while other parties like the liberal Free Egyptians and Social Democrats seek to maintain a balance of power.\n\nIn Mubarak's trial, prosecutors accused him of corruption and ordering the use of force against protesters, demanding a \"harsh penalty.\" The trial resumes after a two-month break, with Mubarak's son Gamal emerging as a key figure in the former president's alleged succession plan. The outcome of the elections and Mubarak's trial will determine the future of Egypt's political landscape, with the possibility of an all-Islamist government or a coalition that includes more liberal voices.\n\nAs the military's grip on power remains tenuous, clashes between security forces and protesters have occurred, leading to calls for further demonstrations on the one-year anniversary of Mubarak's ousting. The elections and Mubarak's trial are thus unfolding against a backdrop of economic struggle, political uncertainty, and the pursuit of justice for past abuses.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "In a peculiar incident, a driver named Nabila Altahan found herself in an unexpected situation when her GPS navigation system directed her to make a sudden turn while driving a Toyota Corolla on Route 4 in Mendon, Massachusetts. Altahan, attempting to follow the instructions, lost control of the vehicle and accidentally drove the car up a telephone pole's wire support. The incident occurred near Sugar & Spice Restaurant around 8 p.m. on a Wednesday evening. Fortunately, both Altahan and her passenger escaped unharmed. As the car dangled from the guy wire, a witness from a nearby mini-golf course observed the scene. Emergency responders, including State Police and the Rutland City Fire Department, swiftly arrived at the scene to rescue the driver and secure the vehicle.

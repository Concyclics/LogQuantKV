Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke increases MRSA's resistance to antibiotics and impairs the effectiveness of the immune system in combating the bacteria. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes more adherent to human cells and develops a higher tolerance to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it harder to kill. A similar effect was observed with e-cigarette smoke, but the resistance was found to be significantly stronger in MRSA when exposed to cigarette smoke.\n\nThese findings suggest that smoking not only poses health risks to smokers but also indirectly aids bacteria in becoming more aggressive and difficult to treat. The study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, highlights the dual impact of smoking on human health and infectious diseases.

As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from the previous year's count. The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a respiratory illness or fever. Symptoms include paralysis, particularly in the limbs, and in some cases, respiratory issues.\n\nAFM cases have spiked in 2014 and 2016, with 120 cases confirmed in 2014, and the numbers have continued to rise since April 2016, with at least 32 cases reported by July. While the disease was initially linked to enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) during the 2014 outbreak, the cause remains uncertain, with no definitive link established this year. The condition is particularly concerning due to the lack of effective treatments, with most patients showing only partial recovery and no specific cure.\n\nThe CDC is urging vigilance and monitoring, as the virus causing AFM could be enterovirus or another pathogen. The condition is rare, with treatment options limited to physical therapy and experimental treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or potentially Prozac. The condition affects both children and adults, with no specific vaccine or cure available.\n\nParents and healthcare professionals are advised to maintain good hygiene to prevent the spread of potential triggers like enteroviruses. The condition's sudden rise in some regions, like California and Kansas, has prompted concern among experts, who are calling for more research to identify the cause and potential treatments.\n\nAffected families, like the Roberts and Andersen households, have faced significant challenges, with children experiencing rapid paralysis and long-term disabilities. The case of 3-year-old Carter Roberts and 6-year-old McKenzie Anderson highlight the urgency of understanding AFM, as it can strike seemingly healthy children without warning.\n\nAs the CDC investigates the recent outbreaks, the focus is on identifying any patterns or clusters of cases, as well as studying the role of enteroviruses in the disease.

Researchers, including Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli from the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, have analyzed the cloth using Bloodstain Pattern Analysis. Their study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggests that the stains do not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion scenario, pointing to inconsistencies such as bloodstains on the shroud that cannot be replicated with a crucified or hanging body. The researchers found that the bloodstains on the cloth do not align with the expected patterns from a crucifixion, with some angles being impossible to achieve in a crucified position. The tests on a live subject and a mannequin showed that the blood flow and patterns do not match those on the Shroud of Turin, casting doubt on its authenticity.\n\nThe shroud's fame dates back centuries, with radiocarbon dating placing it between 1260 and 1390 CE. While the cloth's weave and composition support its Middle Eastern origin, the recent forensic analysis questions its historical significance. The investigation adds to the ongoing debate about the shroud's authenticity and the methods used to create the imprinted image.\n\nWhile the shroud remains a subject of fascination, this forensic study suggests that the image may not be a result of a crucifixion event, potentially indicating an artistic or didactic representation from the 14th century.

Rowling, known for her work with the charity Lumos, writes about the plight of millions of children worldwide who are unjustifiably separated from their families and confined in institutions. Inspired by a photograph of a caged child, Rowling founded Lumos to advocate for ending the institutionalization of children, which she believes is a global issue that can be eradicated by 2050. The organization's work focuses on countries like Moldova, where there has been a significant reduction in institutionalized children due to their efforts, and the Czech Republic, where the number of children in institutions is decreasing.\n\nThe root cause of institutionalization is often poverty, lack of education and health facilities, and inadequate alternatives for children with special needs or those at risk. Institutions, especially those with poor conditions, have been linked to severe harm to children's development, physical and mental well-being, and long-term prospects. Research shows that family-based care, such as fostering, adoption, and support for impoverished families, significantly improves children's outcomes and is more cost-effective than maintaining institutions.\n\nLumos, with the support of international donors, is working towards ending institutionalization by promoting inclusive education, supporting vulnerable families, and investing in community-based care. The success stories in countries like Bulgaria and the Czech Republic demonstrate that with concerted efforts, it is possible to transform the lives of these children and break the cycle of institutionalization.\n\nThe #Letstalklumos campaign aims to raise awareness and encourage action to end the practice of separating children from their families and create a world where every child can grow up in a loving and nurturing environment.

Found in northeastern China's Hebei Province, the dinosaur had rainbow-colored feathers, similar to those of a hummingbird, covering its head, neck, and chest. The feathers, revealed through microscopic examination, suggest a vibrant palette, hinting at a more colorful world during that era than previously thought.\n\nCaihong had a theropod body, with a Velociraptor-like skull and crested appearance, but it lacked the ability to fly, with its feathers possibly serving for display purposes, such as attracting mates. The dinosaur's feathers were not only colorful but also asymmetrical, with some resembling the feathers of birds like the alula, suggesting a possible ancestral trait. The dinosaur's plumage included both long, linear feathers and short, sinuous ones, with the presence of feathers on its tail indicating a potential role in aerodynamics.\n\nThe dinosaur's skeleton, preserved with remarkable detail, also featured a crested head, a long snout, and a mix of bird-like and dinosaurian traits. Its feathers were not only colorful but also contributed to the understanding of the evolution of feather diversity and coloration in early paravians. The presence of melanosomes in the dinosaur's feathers, similar to those found in modern hummingbirds, indicated that iridescence was a feature in its plumage, adding a new dimension to the understanding of dinosaurian aesthetics.\n\nThe discovery challenges previous assumptions about the role of feathers in dinosaur biology, as Caihong had asymmetrical feathers on its tail, a trait associated with flight in birds. However, the dinosaur's small size and lack of strong evidence for flight capabilities suggest that its feathers might have served more complex roles, such as display or communication.\n\nOverall, the Caihong discovery pushes the boundaries of our understanding of dinosaurian diversity and the potential uses of feathers in their lives, providing valuable insights into the evolution of coloration and display behaviors in the early stages of avian evolution.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones?

However, the tax faced opposition due to its regressive nature, with critics arguing that it led to price hikes, loss of revenue, and migration of customers to neighboring areas. Retailers, like Costco, responded by informing customers about tax-free alternatives outside the city. The tax exempted beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, causing Starbucks to refuse the tax. Seattle's tax has resulted in a backlash from various groups, including Bernie Sanders, labor unions, and businesses. The tax's effectiveness in improving public health was questioned, as people shifted their purchases to avoid the tax, and the city struggled with a potential revenue shortfall.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed within two months due to public outrage, with the soda industry spending millions to fight the measure. The tax's complexity and lack of consistency in applying it to certain beverages fueled frustration and calls for clearer messaging.\n\nThe tax's impact on businesses was significant, with Costco experiencing price increases and decreased sales, while customers shopped elsewhere. The tax's unintended consequences and lack of support from various stakeholders indicate that Seattle's approach may not be sustainable or effective in achieving its initial goals.\n\nIn other cities like Chicago, taxes on sugary beverages faced legal battles and declining sales, highlighting the challenges in implementing such policies.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

Although younger patients tend to have more advanced disease, they also have slightly better survival rates due to earlier detection and treatment. The study highlights the need for earlier screening, possibly as low as age 40, particularly for those with a family history of colorectal cancer or certain risk factors.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The excavation, which included 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, revealed the presence of early technologies like stone axes, bone tools, and ochre use, suggesting local innovation rather than reliance on imported knowledge. The find pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the arid region and contributes to debates about the colonization of Australia and the role of humans in the extinction of megafauna.

{"pred": "This news summary discusses the concept of advanced civilizations expanding and harnessing energy in the universe, as outlined by astrophysicist ideas and recent research. The article begins by explaining the three stages of technological advancement, proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, where civilizations progress from capturing a planet's resources (Type I), to a star's energy (Type II), to a galaxy's resources (Type III). A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that as civilizations advance, they would inevitably seek to capture energy from distant stars to counteract the expanding universe's isolation due to dark energy. This energy extraction would not only provide resources but also ensure against being left behind by the accelerating expansion.\n\nHooper proposes that any advanced civilization would comprehend the need to secure energy sources and would construct massive structures like Dyson spheres, which are spherical shells of satellites that collect and beam starlight back to their home planet. These structures, inspired by science fiction concepts like Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\" and Freeman Dyson's proposal, could be used to maintain energy access as the universe expands. Dyson spheres would require immense technological capabilities, potentially achievable by civilizations far more advanced than humanity, estimated to be in the Type II or III stage.\n\nThe search for extraterrestrial life might involve looking for signs of energy-intensive activities, such as Dyson spheres or manipulated stars, as these would indicate the presence of civilizations capable of capturing and utilizing energy from distant stars. However, the expanding universe's influence, symbolized by dark energy, poses a deadline for civilizations to act, as stars beyond our Local Group would eventually become inaccessible. Therefore, the quest to dominate the universe and prevent isolation becomes a race against time.\n\nIn summary, the news highlights the theoretical progression of civilizations through the Kardashev hierarchy and the potential strategies they might employ to secure energy resources in an expanding universe, with implications for human searches for alien life and the possibility of detecting advanced civilizations through their energy-extraction techniques.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "A series of recent discoveries in the field of paleoanthropology and archaeology challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of early human cultures. Researchers have uncovered evidence suggesting that dramatic shifts in toolmaking and social organization occurred much earlier than previously thought, possibly around 320,000 years ago in East Africa. This shift, marked by the emergence of Middle Stone Age tools and the use of obsidian from distant sources, may have been driven by climate changes that forced early humans to expand their foraging territories and develop trade networks.\n\nThe excavations in Olorgesailie, Kenya, reveal a progression from simpler, locally sourced stone tools to more specialized, Middle Stone Age tools, indicating increased mobility and the need for more efficient hunting techniques. The discovery of obsidian tools, often associated with trading networks, suggests that hominids were interacting with each other over long distances, possibly hinting at the development of social structures and resource-sharing among Homo sapiens or their relatives.\n\nClimate fluctuations, particularly in East Africa, played a significant role in shaping these behavioral changes. Frequent shifts in environmental conditions forced early humans to adapt by developing more versatile tools and possibly engaging in long-distance communication and trade. The Olorgesailie Basin, with its Middle Stone Age tools and the presence of obsidian from afar, provide insights into the potential for early Homo sapiens to innovate and collaborate in response to environmental pressures.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether the observed tool advancements were solely due to climate-driven behavioral changes or if they were a result of cognitive shifts in Homo sapiens, the findings align with genetic evidence placing the origin of modern humans in Africa around 350,000 to 260,000 years ago. The Olorgesailie discoveries emphasize the gradual development of complex behaviors and technologies, challenging the notion of a single \"human revolution\" and suggesting a more continuous process of cultural evolution.\n\nThe study of Middle Stone Age tools and their connection to climate change and trade networks provides a glimpse into the roots of human adaptability and the potential for early social cohesion. As researchers continue to unravel the complexities of the African archaeological record, the story of human development emerges as a tale of incremental change and adaptation, rather than a single transformative event.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Initially, Hooper disliked Cruz due to his violent behavior, but over time, she discovered a caring side to him. Despite facing numerous challenges, including Cruz's unstable home life, Hooper took him in and eventually adopted him when he was 12 years old after his biological mother asked her to keep him temporarily. She provided a stable environment, support, and guidance, helping him overcome his academic struggles, change his behavior, and even legally adopting him when he was 16. This adoption marked a turning point in Cruz's life, leading to a successful career and a strong bond with Hooper, who eventually became his mother.\n\nIn the second news story, a teacher, Linda Hooper, faced a challenging student named Cruz Riojas, who was later renamed Cruz Hooper after being legally adopted by her.

The 2006 Military Commissions Act (MCA) revoked habeas corpus rights for certain individuals labeled \"enemy combatants,\" allowing the executive branch to detain suspects outside the traditional court system. Detainees at Guantanamo Bay, particularly those without substantial evidence, have faced indefinite detention and lack of access to fair trials. The Supreme Court's ongoing involvement in habeas corpus cases at Guantanamo challenges the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches.\n\nConcurrently, a significant development occurred in the legal realm when a New York court granted the first-ever habeas corpus order to two chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, at Stony Brook University. This unprecedented decision recognizes the animals as legal persons, allowing them to challenge their detention in a court of law. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP) filed the lawsuit, arguing that the chimps' cognitive abilities and emotional complexity warrant their release to a sanctuary. While the case is a milestone, it also reflects a broader push for animal rights advocates to extend legal protections to other animals, such as elephants and marine mammals, arguing that they are autonomous beings deserving of bodily liberty.\n\nThese developments emphasize the erosion of traditional legal protections and the evolving understanding of rights for non-human entities. The MCA's impact on habeas corpus and the court's decision for chimpanzees signal a potential shift in how society views the legal standing of animals, with implications for future legal battles and the defense of fundamental liberties.", "answers": ["The writ of habeas corpus lets prisoners appear in court to make their captors justify why they're being held.

The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

This raid, which took place in August 2011, marked the second time the company was targeted, following a previous seizure of a shipment in 2009. The Lacey Act, amended in 2008, holds that the law applies to both endangered animals and plants, including the木材 seized by the government. Gibson maintains that it has purchased legally sourced wood, pointing to documents supporting its compliance with US and Malagasy laws, but the government alleges that the company knew about the risks associated with sourcing from Madagascar and possibly other countries like India.\n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claims that Gibson was aware of the potential for illegal timber harvests, having conducted a tour to assess the legality of sourcing. Gibson denies these allegations, stating that it stopped importing wood from Madagascar after 2009 and that the seized wood was legally obtained. The case has raised concerns among the guitar industry, with some, like Chris Martin of C.F. Martin Guitar, supporting the enforcement of the Lacey Act to combat illegal logging, while others criticize its retroactive nature and the potential impact on vintage guitar collectors.\n\nAttorney Ronald Bienstock argues that the Lacey Act's broad reach could affect guitar makers and collectors, as it covers even vintage instruments and requires them to prove the legal origin of wood components. The situation has led to a shift in the guitar market, with some companies reducing imports and dealers like George Gruhn adapting to the new regulations.\n\nThe controversy highlights the intersection of music and environmental regulation, as the government aims to enforce responsible sourcing of wood to curb illegal logging. While the Gibson case remains unresolved, the outcome could set precedents for future enforcement and the expectations placed on businesses in the guitar industry. The EIA's Andrea Johnson defends the law, emphasizing the need to address unsustainable logging practices and promote responsible sourcing, even if it leads to temporary inconvenience for those in the industry.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

A team of scientists, using data from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and other observatories, discovered that a large body of water, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, once existed on Mars, comparable to the Atlantic Ocean's volume. This ancient ocean, which was up to a mile deep, persisted for millions of years, providing a potentially habitable environment for early Mars.\n\nThe ocean's existence is inferred from the high concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, in the Martian atmosphere. The high D/H ratio indicates extensive water loss, with the planet losing enough water to create a global ocean that covered nearly half of the planet's surface at one point. This finding contradicts previous beliefs about the sporadic nature of water on Mars, suggesting a more consistent and long-lasting潮湿 climate.\n\nThe ancient ocean's presence supports the possibility of past habitability and the potential for life on Mars. Researchers like Charles Cockell note that the prolonged exposure to liquid water increases the likelihood of a conducive environment for life. However, the exact extent of water and the possibility of past life remain speculative, with ongoing research such as the Exomars rover mission set to explore further.\n\nIn addition to the ancient ocean, NASA's Curiosity rover has detected methane in the Martian atmosphere, although its origin is still debated – it could be geological or tied to the possibility of past or present microbial life.\n\nOverall, these recent discoveries paint a more hospitable picture of Mars in its distant past, making it a more intriguing target for the search for signs of ancient or extant life.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

This decision affects not only Kit Kat but also other similar snacks like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which can now potentially use the shape without fear of infringing on Nestlé's claims. The case highlights the need for a product to be distinctive across all EU markets, not just a significant part, for a shape to be considered a trademarkable element.\n\nThe ruling also impacts the ongoing battle between Nestlé and Mondelez, as it sends the matter back to the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), requiring them to reconsider the shape's distinctiveness. While Nestlé may appeal further, the court's decision emphasizes that a trademark must demonstrate recognition across the entire EU, not just in certain regions.\n\nIn other trademark disputes, Cadbury's attempt to trademark a purple shade for its Dairy Milk bars was unsuccessful, and Lindt faced a similar challenge with its gold-wrapped Easter bunnies, which led to a court ruling allowing competitors to use similar designs.

{"pred": "New research on dinosaur vocalizations challenges the iconic T. rex roar from popular culture, revealing that the sound of the mighty dinosaur may have been quite different from what we're accustomed to seeing in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" Scientists argue that the T. rex, despite its fearsome reputation, likely made sounds more akin to today's birds, with closed-mouth vocalizations that could have resembled the coo of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich. These sounds, produced through an esophageal pouch, were low-frequency and possibly used in defense or mating displays. The study, published in the journal Evolution, suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved at least 16 times in birds, hinting that dinosaurs, with their large bodies, might have had similar capabilities. While the iconic T. rex roar from movies like \"Jurassic Park\" is a cinematic invention, the researchers propose that dinosaurs may have communicated in a way that was bird-like, with some species possibly producing coos or hoots, depending on their size.\n\nThe study also draws attention to the diversity of dinosaur vocalizations, acknowledging that the lack of fossil evidence leaves much to speculation. Some researchers used living animals' sounds, such as tortoises, geese, and horses, to create the dinosaur-like noises in \"Jurassic Park,\" like the velociraptor's hiss and the T. rex's roar, which were influenced by real-life animals like baby elephants, horses, and even a goose. The iconic T. rex's roar was created by combining various animal sounds, including a baby elephant's cry, tiger's growl, and an alligator's gurgle.\n\nThe study underscores the complexity of dinosaur vocalizations, with some suggesting that dinosaurs may have communicated through closed-mouth sounds, similar to the cooing of doves or the hoots of large birds like ostriches. The authors note that the evolution of vocalizations in dinosaurs, though not fully understood, could have been influenced by the same physiological mechanisms found in birds, such as the esophageal pouch for共鸣.\n\nAs the field of dinosaur vocalization continues to evolve, researchers are looking beyond Hollywood depictions, exploring the possibility that dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies, might have had unique vocal abilities. The study's findings contribute to a broader understanding of dinosaur communication, providing insights into the rich tapestry of prehistoric sounds that may have shaped our perception of these ancient creatures.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

The memo, which focuses on a dossier compiled by a former British spy, questions the legitimacy of surveillance warrants obtained against Trump's campaign. The House Intelligence Committee voted to release the memo, sparking a debate between Republicans, who argue for transparency, and Democrats, who claim it could distort the Russia probe.\n\nSecondly, the White House indicated that President Trump had not yet decided on releasing the memo, but he favored full transparency. The FBI and the Department of Justice expressed concerns about the potential release, fearing it could compromise national security or undermine the ongoing Russia investigation. The House Intelligence Committee's vote to release the memo, with a subsequent vote to also consider the Democratic response, intensified partisan tensions.\n\nSenators Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins advised Trump to remain silent on independent investigations into his campaign's ties with Russia, while also urging special counsel Robert Mueller to review potential attempts to fire him. Trump's handling of the Russia probe and his potential firing of Mueller became topics of concern, with some lawmakers calling for caution and transparency.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee's vote to release the classified memo, authored by Republicans, sparked a showdown between the parties. Democrats criticized the move as a political maneuver aimed at discrediting the Russia investigation, while Republicans accused the DOJ of obstructing transparency. FBI Director Christopher Wray was shown the memo but had concerns about its contents, leading to calls for a thorough review before any decision on its release.\n\nIn conclusion, the news revolves around the contentious release of a classified memo, the balance of power between Congress and the executive branch regarding the Russia probe, and the implications for the investigation's integrity.

Bayesian methods have been successful in previous searches, such as locating Air France Flight 447 in 2011, where the team at Metron Scientific Solutions, including Lawrence D.

The search for Flight 370 involves refining probabilities in three dimensions, accounting for factors like depth in the water, and adjusting for new information.\n\nStatisticians, like Stone and his team, use Bayesian methods to quantify probabilities and create a probability distribution across the search area, considering factors like the likelihood of the plane being intact or destroyed, and the probability of it being in a specific location given the available data.

Despite this, no military deployment was made to Benghazi, and the report suggests that the administration's focus on the video as a cause of the violence delayed a more accurate assessment of the situation.\n\nThe report also accuses the administration of providing a false narrative to the public, with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton initially linking the attack to the video, while private communications revealed a more detailed understanding of the attack, including the possibility of a terrorist attack, not a protest. The report disputes the claim of a stand-down order and questions the handling of intelligence, suggesting that some officials were aware of the true nature of the attack but misled the public for political reasons.\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, criticized the committee's chairman, Trey Gowdy, for attempting to prevent accountability and transparency, stating that the report does not fundamentally change the understanding of the attack but adds detail to the narrative.

Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen.

{"pred": "In the wake of Egypt's first parliamentary elections since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak, Egyptians voted in the third round, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to lead, possibly securing a majority. Mubarak's trial continued, with prosecutors accusing him of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression. The military-controlled government faces opposition from protesters demanding an end to military rule and a swift transition to civilian leadership. Economic challenges, including a decline in foreign currency reserves and a struggling stock market, loom as the country prepares for the new parliament's inaugural session on January 23.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood aims to maintain its lead in the elections, with some estimating they could secure a majority in the new parliament. However, the Brotherhood has stated it seeks a coalition government to balance power, despite its potential to govern alone. The military rulers face opposition from both the Brotherhood and protesters, with the latter pushing for a faster transition to civilian rule.\n\nIn Mubarak's trial, prosecutors demanded a harsh penalty, accusing him of oppression and violence, including the attempted suppression of the 2011 revolution. The trial's outcome could impact the future of the ex-president, with the possibility of a death sentence on the table. Mubarak's son, Gamal, and others face corruption charges alongside their father.\n\nThe election results and the trial reflect the complex political landscape, with the military's role in governance remaining uncertain. As Egypt moves towards a new era, the nation grapples with economic challenges, including a drop in tourism and foreign investment due to ongoing unrest. The outcome of the parliamentary elections and Mubarak's trial will shape the country's political future and determine the pace of democratic transition.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}

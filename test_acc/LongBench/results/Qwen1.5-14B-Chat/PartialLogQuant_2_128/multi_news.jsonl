As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from the previous year's count. The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a viral illness, such as enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), though the exact cause remains uncertain.\n\nIn 2014, there was a surge in AFM cases, with 120 confirmed in the US, leading to concerns among health officials. While EV-D68 was initially suspected, the link is inconclusive, and no specific virus has been definitively linked to the condition. This year, the CDC is investigating a potential correlation with EV-D68, but no widespread EV-D68 outbreak has been reported yet.\n\nThe condition presents with symptoms like fever, respiratory issues, and rapidly progressing paralysis, often affecting limbs and requiring hospitalization. Treatment options are limited, with physical therapy and experimental treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and possibly Prozac being discussed. Recovery rates for children vary, with some partially recovering and others experiencing long-term paralysis.\n\nParents and healthcare professionals are alarmed by the sudden increase in cases, particularly among children, with at least four states reporting multiple cases. The condition is still rare, but the lack of understanding and the potential for a recurrence of the 2014 outbreak raise concerns among experts.\n\nParents, like Robin Roberts and Angie Andersen, whose children were affected, are frustrated by the lack of knowledge about AFM and the need for more research. The condition's resurgence highlights the importance of continued surveillance, identifying potential triggers, and developing preventive or therapeutic strategies.\n\nAs the CDC investigates, they advise maintaining good hygiene to minimize the risk of transmission, emphasizing the need for more information and a clearer understanding of the disease's causes and treatments.", "answers": ["At first, it seemed like 4-year-old Laura Carson was suffering from a simple headache.

Researchers from Liverpool John Moores University and the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, led by Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth using a novel approach. Their study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggests that the stains do not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion scenario, pointing to inconsistencies such as bloodstains on the shroud that cannot be replicated with a standing or hanging body. The researchers found that the bloodstains on the shroud do not align with the angles and positions that would result from a crucifixion, indicating that the image may not reflect a real-life event.\n\nThe shroud, which is believed by some to date back to the 13th or 14th century, has long been a subject of debate due to its enigmatic image and the lack of consensus on its authenticity. While the cloth's carbon dating supports its Middle Ages origin, the recent forensic analysis casts doubt on its claimed connection to the crucifixion of Jesus. The researchers' findings challenge the notion that the shroud is a historical artifact, instead suggesting it might be a medieval creation or a symbolic representation.\n\nDespite the intriguing scientific mystery surrounding the Shroud of Turin, the investigation does not definitively prove its inauthenticity.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The organization aims to eradicate the institutionalization of children by 2050, citing successful cases in countries like Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where significant reductions in institutional placements have been achieved through investments in education, health, and family-based care alternatives.\n\nThe author highlights the detrimental effects of institutional life on children's development, including physical and emotional harm, stunted growth, and lifelong consequences.

The FBI and DOJ had concerns about the memo's release, fearing it might compromise national security. President Donald Trump eventually approved the memo's declassification and public release after a review process, acknowledging the importance of balancing oversight with national security considerations.\n\nThe memo highlights that the FBI sought a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant for Carter Page, despite his status as an American citizen, and the subsequent renewals were signed by various officials without revealing the political funding and motivations behind the Steele dossier. The dossier, compiled by Christopher Steele, was a central piece of evidence in the application, but crucial details about its funding and the political connections were not disclosed to the court.\n\nAdditionally, the memo reveals that Steele's credibility was compromised due to his unauthorized contacts with the media, including a September 2016 Yahoo News article sourced from him.

The dinosaur, which lived 161 million years ago, had feathers that were reconstructed to have been iridescent, similar to hummingbird feathers, with colors shifting in the light. Named after the Mandarin words for \"rainbow\" and \"big crest,\" Caihong had a mix of dinosaur and bird-like characteristics, including crested head, sharp teeth, and possibly bird-like feathers for flight (though the latter is debated). Its feathers were not only colorful but also featured asymmetrical vanes, suggesting the presence of feathers for both display and potential flight.\n\nThe dinosaur's body had black feathers, while its head and neck sported iridescent feathers, which were thought to have played a role in attracting mates or providing insulation. Caihong's dinosaurian traits included a Velociraptor-like skull and a short, possibly flightless tail, while its bird-like features included a long snout and a possible hint of flight capabilities.\n\nThe fossil's preservation allowed for the detection of melanosomes, which indicated that the dinosaur's feathers were likely black, with the iridescence resulting from the arrangement of nanostructures. The discovery suggests a more colorful and diverse world of dinosaurs than previously imagined, with Caihong representing an early step in the evolution of avian traits.\n\nThis find pushes back the timeline of iridescent feathers and asymmetric feather structures, potentially signaling the presence of these features in the early stages of paravian evolution.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear.

The study, conducted on 64,000 Danish children, observed a correlation between acetaminophen use and a 29% increased risk of ADHD, particularly when taken for extended periods.

The researchers emphasize that it is not a recommendation to completely avoid the drug, but rather advise against frequent or prolonged use until more research is conducted. Infections during pregnancy, not necessarily acetaminophen, are already known to affect brain development, and the study does not rule out the possibility of other factors contributing to ADHD.\n\nThe study's authors, like Dr. Beate Ritz from UCLA, advise pregnant women to consider alternative methods for pain relief, such as non-pharmacological treatments, during this period. However, they also note that the evidence is not yet strong enough to discourage acetaminophen use entirely, and more research is needed to establish causality.\n\nThe FDA acknowledges that acetaminophen, when used as directed, is generally safe.

During an interview with anchor Brianna Keilar, Cohen repeatedly queried the source of the polls suggesting Trump's low ratings, famously responding with \"Says who?\" when asked about the campaign's falling numbers.\n\nThe interview took place amidst a significant shake-up within Trump's campaign team, with the addition of Breitbart News' CEO Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager. Despite the changes, Cohen maintained that the campaign was not experiencing a shake-up, but rather a strategic adjustment. He praised Conway's appointment, stating she was a good choice and understood the data.\n\nKeilar's mention of Trump's low poll numbers prompted Cohen's repeated questioning, highlighting the tension between the campaign and the perception of their standing. The incident on CNN sparked a trending topic on social media, with users mocking Cohen's response with the hashtag #SaysWho?.\n\nWhile Trump's campaign faced challenges in the polls, Cohen's response to the polls' claims of a downturn was met with amusement and criticism online. The summary concludes with Cohen's admission that the campaign was not yet ready for Conway's appointment but believed she would bring a positive impact based on her understanding of campaign data.\n\nOverall, these news passages paint a picture of a campaign in transition, grappling with public perception and seeking to regain ground through personnel changes while dealing with a skeptical public and a persistent debate over the accuracy of poll results.", "answers": ["Donald Trump's lawyer has apparently decided that it's his turn to make the gaffes.

Dubbed Planet Nine or Planet X, the proposed planet is believed to be located at the edge of the solar system, beyond the orbit of Pluto. Its gravitational influence is inferred from the unusual orbits of distant dwarf planets and small objects, which seem to be affected by a massive unseen celestial body. Brown and his colleague Konstantin Batygin estimate Planet Nine's mass to be between five to 10 times that of Earth, making it potentially larger than Pluto.\n\nBrown's previous work, including his discovery of Eris, led to Pluto's demotion from planetary status in 2006 when the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined a planet, resulting in Pluto's classification as a dwarf planet. Brown, motivated by his daughter's request, has been actively searching for a new planet to restore Pluto's standing. While direct observation of Planet Nine has not yet been made, its existence is supported by mathematical calculations and the gravitational influence it exerts on nearby celestial bodies.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine, if confirmed, would reshape our understanding of the solar system's formation and dynamics.

NASA's director, Jim Green, emphasizes the need for extraordinary evidence to support such a claim, and astronomers worldwide are searching for the elusive planet.\n\nThe debate over Pluto's status continues, with some advocating for its reinstatement as a planet due to the recent discoveries by the New Horizons mission.

She believed a soy-based formula from Whole Foods was suitable for the baby, despite doctor's orders.\n\nMarkham's baby was subsequently taken into state custody, and she was arrested and later released on bail. During a court hearing, a judge ruled that Sarah would regain custody of Caleb with the condition that she provide a nutritionist's report within 10 days.

{"pred": "A recent analysis of colorectal cancer data from the University of Michigan has revealed a concerning trend: one in every seven colorectal cancer cases now affects individuals under the age of 50, challenging the traditional belief that the disease predominantly affects older adults. This shift, as seen in a study of over 258,000 patients, highlights the need for reevaluating screening guidelines, as younger patients tend to present with more advanced disease and require aggressive treatment, including higher rates of surgery and radiation therapy.\n\nYounger patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer are found to have a slightly longer survival rate compared to older patients, despite having more advanced disease at diagnosis. The study suggests that nearly 15% of colorectal cancer cases in the US will be in patients under 50 by 2030, up from 15% currently. Researchers urge healthcare providers to be vigilant for signs of the disease in younger patients, as early detection is crucial.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of considering family history and risk factors when deciding on screening, with some guidelines recommending earlier testing for those with a family history. However, experts debate whether to alter screening guidelines universally, as the benefits of earlier detection may not outweigh the costs and lower yield in younger populations.\n\nWhile colon cancer is traditionally associated with older adults, the rising incidence in younger demographics prompts a call to action for the medical community to adapt their approach to identifying and treating the disease. Risk factors like smoking, obesity, and poor diet may contribute to the growing trend, warranting further investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, the increasing prevalence of colorectal cancer in younger patients challenges existing screening recommendations and emphasizes the need for more targeted and possibly earlier screenings, as well as increased awareness of the disease's symptoms among younger adults.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, found by chance when a colleague needed a toilet break, holds significant implications for understanding human settlement in the region. The shelter contains sophisticated tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, suggesting early colonization and hunting practices. The presence of artefacts and fireplaces pushes back the timeline of human activity in the area, potentially indicating an earlier arrival of Aboriginal Australians than previously thought, possibly as early as 55,000 to 60,000 years ago.\n\nThe excavation methods were meticulous, with hand excavation, grid systems, and careful documentation of artefacts and stratigraphy. Optical dating techniques, including single-grain OSL and TT-OSL, were employed to date the site, revealing a depositional sequence. The discovery challenges the conventional wisdom about the timing of human settlement in the region, particularly regarding the presence of megafauna, which suggests a closer relationship between humans and extinct animals than previously believed.\n\nThe site also showcases the oldest-known use of ochre in Australia, pushing back the development of key technologies like bone and stone tools, and the possible local innovation of these technologies. The find supports the theory that Indigenous Australians were more adaptable and resourceful than previously assumed, challenging Eurocentric views on their material culture.\n\nThe discovery, which includes the oldest reliably dated evidence of human-megafauna interaction, contributes to the ongoing debate about the extinction of megafauna, with some suggesting human presence played a role.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

Astrophysicist Dan Hooper's paper, based on Nikolai Kardashev's three-stage model of technological advancement, suggests that civilizations aiming to survive and expand in the face of cosmic isolation due to dark energy-driven expansion would eventually harvest energy from distant stars. To achieve this, they would potentially construct massive structures like Dyson spheres or swarms of solar-powered satellites, such as Stapledon's \"star light-traps\" or Dyson's proposed energy-gathering shells.\n\nHooper proposes that advanced civilizations would prioritize securing energy from stars before they become inaccessible due to the expanding universe. This would involve capturing stars through methods like Dyson spheres or statites, which would collect and beam energy back to their home planets. The presence of alien civilizations could be detected through unusual light signatures, such as stars being accelerated by energy extraction or the distinct spectra of galaxies with their prime stars harvested.\n\nWhile humans are currently at a relatively early stage of technological development (Type I civilization), the possibility of encountering older, more advanced civilizations (Type II and III) harvesting stars for energy is discussed. These civilizations would need to employ sophisticated technology like Dyson spheres or statites to maintain their energy supply and expand their reach.\n\nThe quest to detect these extraterrestrial structures and the implications for interstellar communication and the search for life in the cosmos are ongoing areas of interest among scientists and science fiction writers, with Dyson spheres and other mega-structures becoming recurring themes in both fields.

Initially, Oakleigh, born at 3 pounds, displayed remarkable strength and progress in overcoming her initial NICU stay. However, she recently fell ill with a high fever, which led to a diagnosis of a severe kidney infection caused by a dangerous, antibiotic-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This bacteria, known for causing infections in vulnerable individuals, has affected Oakleigh's health significantly.\n\nThe infection, initially treated with antibiotics, returned and required hospitalization. Tests revealed that Oakleigh has stage 3 kidney reflux and moderate aortic septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary stenosis, making her condition more complex. She is scheduled for surgery to address the kidney reflux in her left kidney, which has 22% functionality due to two separate ureters. The surgery aims to prevent future infections and improve her chances of recovery.\n\nThe second passage explains that Pseudomonas infections, like Oakleigh's, are common in hospitals and can affect people with weakened immune systems.

Starting with comedian Jon Stewart's appointment as the host in 1999, the show underwent significant changes. Stewart initially faced resistance from the existing staff, who were set in the format established by his predecessor, Craig Kilborn. Stewart's vision was to make the show more pointed and purposeful, focusing on political satire and holding public figures accountable.\n\nKey hires, such as Ben Karlin and Stephen Colbert, played crucial roles in shaping the show's direction. Karlin brought a sense of anger and a focus on hypocrisy, while Colbert's presence as a straightlaced correspondent provided a fresh perspective. Stewart's early struggles with the writing staff and the transition from Kilborn's lighter tone to a more pointed commentary on politics became evident in the \"fuck-you meeting\" and subsequent power struggles.\n\nSteve Carell joined the show as a correspondent, eventually becoming a key contributor, and Colbert helped recruit Carell and others.

Recent studies, published in Science, suggest that dramatic shifts in East African climate around 320,000 years ago may have driven advancements in toolmaking and the emergence of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their relatives. Researchers found Middle Stone Age tools, the oldest of their kind, indicating a transition from simpler tools to more specialized designs like obsidian-based spearpoints and red pigment use, possibly signaling increased social interaction and trade.\n\nThese innovations, including the use of obsidian from distant sources, suggest长途 communication and collaboration among hominid populations. The Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya experienced frequent environmental shifts, which may have forced early humans to expand their foraging territories and develop more complex strategies. The discovery of Middle Stone Age tools predating previous estimates by tens of thousands of years indicates a potential link between climate change and behavioral changes.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether the tools were made by Homo sapiens or a related species, the presence of obsidian and pigment trade suggests the possibility of early social networks. Genetic evidence supports the idea that these changes occurred before the emergence of H. sapiens in Africa. However, other factors like population dynamics and resource availability may have also influenced tool innovations.\n\nThe Olorgesailie findings challenge the traditional view of a \"human revolution\" around 40,000-50,000 years ago, as the evidence points to a gradual progression of technological and cultural advancements much earlier, possibly during the Middle Stone Age. The transition between tool types, coupled with the transportation of raw materials over long distances, implies the existence of complex social networks and the beginnings of trade.\n\nThese discoveries emphasize the importance of climate change in shaping human adaptation and highlight the need to reevaluate the criteria for defining the \"modern human\" mind. As researchers continue to uncover evidence of early tool innovations and cultural exchanges, the timeline of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors are being rewritten, challenging the notion of a single \"human revolution\" and revealing a more nuanced picture of our ancestors' cognitive abilities and adaptability.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR.

They say the day after a Born Killers scene in which the girl sat on Sizemore's lap, she told her parents that he had touched her inappropriately, possibly putting his finger inside her. \"At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited.

Despite initial animosity, Hooper's compassion grew as she witnessed Cruz's difficult home life, including living in poverty and enduring abuse from his stepfather. Over time, Cruz began helping Hooper in her classroom, eventually leading to a significant change in his behavior. By the end of his sixth-grade year, he had transformed from a troublemaker to a beloved figure in the school, known for his resilience and eventual adoption by Hooper.\n\nCruz's adoption by Hooper took place informally when he was 12 after she agreed to care for him when his mother couldn't due to domestic violence.

Previously, Kieran had partial hearing due to a hearing aid, and he expressed a desire for larger ears since the age of six. The surgery, a major procedure, took six hours and involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's chest to form the ear frameworks, which were then grafted onto his head. The operation was a success, and Kieran's parents were thrilled with the outcome, stating that it will significantly enhance his self-esteem.\n\nKieran's mother, Louise Sorkin, hopes the surgery will prevent bullying at school and promote acceptance. The procedure, while primarily cosmetic, highlights the potential of ear reconstructions for children with microtia. Researchers at Great Ormond Street Hospital and the University College London's Institute for Child Health are exploring advancements in tissue engineering, aiming to develop less invasive methods in the future, such as growing ear structures from a patient's own stem cells.\n\nThe surgery, though not related to hearing, holds great psychological significance, as it can greatly impact a child's life. Kieran's father, David Sorkin, emphasized the importance of the decision, which was driven by Kieran's desire and the desire to improve his confidence. The hospital plans to continue monitoring Kieran's progress, with a follow-up surgery scheduled in six months.\n\nAs technology advances, the possibility of using stem cells for ear reconstructions is being explored, offering a less invasive alternative to current procedures.

This is the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been granted such a right, potentially signaling a shift in how courts view the legal status of non-human entities. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP), which filed the lawsuit, argues that the chimps' cognitive complexity merits their release from captivity and relocation to a sanctuary. The case began in 2013 when NhRP sought to free the chimpanzees, claiming they are being held unlawfully.\n\nMeanwhile, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006, which revoked habeas corpus rights for certain individuals labeled \"enemy combatants,\" remains a concern. The act allowed the executive branch to detain individuals indefinitely without due process, undermining a fundamental legal principle dating back to the Magna Carta. The MCA, particularly its application to Guantanamo Bay detainees and legal residents labeled \"enemy combatants,\" has raised concerns about a narrowing of individual liberties and the erosion of the rule of law.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to hear habeas corpus cases for Guantanamo detainees, like those from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), highlights the ongoing struggle to balance national security concerns with the preservation of legal rights. The MCA's extension of a second-class justice system to non-citizens designated as \"enemy combatants\" has sparked debates about the limits of executive power and the importance of habeas corpus as a safeguard against arbitrary detention.\n\nWhile the Stony Brook case represents a potential milestone in recognizing non-human legal personhood, it is not without controversy. Some experts caution that the ruling may not extend to other animals without further legal arguments, but it sets a precedent that could influence future cases involving animals' rights and the possibility of habeas corpus protections. The outcome of these cases could have far-reaching implications for the treatment of animals and the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches.", "answers": ["The writ of habeas corpus lets prisoners appear in court to make their captors justify why they're being held.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps.

Federal marshals seized wood during a raid at the company's facilities in Tennessee, targeting both the 2009 seizure of ebony from Madagascar and the enforcement of the Lacey Act, which extends protection to endangered plants like ebony and rosewood. The law requires end-users, including Gibson, to verify the legality of their supply chain, with the government alleging that the company took steps to maintain a supply chain potentially linked to illegal timber harvests.\n\nGibson denies these claims, stating that they have purchased legally sourced wood and had stopped imports from Madagascar after a coup there. However, the company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, expressed frustration over the lack of clear communication regarding the specifics of the violation. The Environmental Investigation Agency's Andrea Johnson confirmed that Gibson was aware of the risks associated with sourcing from Madagascar and that the company had been investigated for possible non-compliance.\n\nThe Lacey Act, amended in 2008, has led to increased scrutiny of the guitar industry, with concerns raised about the burden it places on businesses, particularly those with older inventory. Some, like Chris Martin of the C.F.

{"pred": "Recent discoveries shed new light on the water history of Mars, suggesting that the planet once had a massive ancient ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere. A team of scientists, using data from NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and other observatories, mapped the Martian atmosphere to reveal an extensive ancient ocean that was up to a mile deep, with a volume equivalent to the Atlantic Ocean's. This ocean, which persisted for millions of years, had a global extent, reaching depths of around 137 meters, and was rich in water, with a higher concentration of deuterium (a heavier isotope of hydrogen) indicating substantial water loss over time.\n\nThe findings challenge previous beliefs about the sporadic presence of water on Mars, revealing a more consistent and widespread watery environment. Mars' ancient climate supported the formation of large bodies of water, including lakes, river deltas, and possibly even seas, providing a more conducive environment for the potential existence of life. The presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere, detected by NASA's Curiosity rover, adds to the intrigue about past habitability.\n\nThe ocean's demise was due to the thinning Martian atmosphere, which led to the loss of water into space. This water loss is estimated to be equivalent to a global ocean covering 20% of the planet's surface, with the majority of the water concentrated in the northern lowlands. The discovery supports the idea that Mars was habitable in its ancient past, although the exact conditions for life remain speculative.\n\nWhile the search for life on Mars continues, these findings strengthen the case for the possibility of past microbial existence. Future missions, such as the Exomars rover, will focus on searching for signs of life, including chemical signatures, potentially hinting at a past or present habitable environment.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, the film's credibility is undermined by its absurdity, particularly in the exaggerated plot elements and the lack of depth in the character development.\n\nOriginally, the film had a high-profile cast change, with actors like Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck being rumored for the lead roles. Ultimately, Smith and rising star Margot Robbie's pairing proved successful, with Smith's portrayal of Nicky Spurgeon, a master con artist, allowing him to showcase his charismatic side after years of playing more serious roles. The film's directorial duo, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, aim for a light-hearted, low-key approach, reminiscent of classic heist films like \"To Catch a Thief\" with a modern twist.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, \"Focus\" offers some enjoyable moments, particularly in the banter between the characters and the stylish visuals. The movie's R-rating allows for a touch of raunchiness, adding to its appeal. Overall, while \"Focus\" may not live up to its initial hype, it finds its footing as a Will Smith vehicle that combines humor, charm, and a touch of suspense, albeit with a flawed narrative structure.", "answers": ["Will Smith stars as Nicky, an established con man who takes on a new apprentice, Australian newcomer Margot Robbie's Jess, in Focus.

Nestlé had been attempting to trademark the four-fingered wafer shape for over a decade, but the court ruled that the shape alone is not distinctive enough to warrant trademark protection. This decision annuls a previous trademark granted to Nestlé and opens the door for competitors like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj to produce similar snacks without infringing on the Kit Kat shape. The case highlights the need for a product to be distinctive across all EU markets, not just a significant part, for a trademark to be upheld.

The outcome affects not only Kit Kat but also other similar products, such as Mondelez's own four-fingered treats. The case has broader implications for trademark law within the EU, with potential consequences for other brands seeking to protect their product shapes.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic image of the T. rex's roar, suggesting that the dinosaur likely didn't sound like the fierce, high-pitched creature portrayed in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" Scientists argue that the T. rex's vocalizations, if any, were more similar to those of birds, with closed-mouth sounds like the coo of a pigeon or ostrich, rather than the open-mouthed roars typically associated with dinosaurs. The study, published in the journal Evolution, reveals that closed-mouth vocalizations, a trait shared by birds with large bodies, may have evolved multiple times in dinosaurs, including the possibility of dinosaurs communicating like ostriches or cassowaries.\n\nThe team of researchers analyzed the vocalizations of living birds and their dinosaur ancestors, identifying a quarter of bird species that produce closed-mouth sounds, particularly in those with large bodies. The study implies that dinosaurs, with their potential for large esophageal pouches, might have communicated in a similar manner, although definitive dinosaur vocalizations remain a mystery due to the lack of fossil evidence.\n\nIn the realm of Jurassic Park, sound designer Gary Rydstrom ingeniously combined real-life animal sounds to create the iconic movie dinos. Velociraptors' calls were influenced by mating tortoises, while the T. rex's roar was a combination of baby elephant, tiger, and alligator sounds, slowed down to create a deep, intimidating effect. The Dilophosaurus, known for its cute appearance, had a more sinister side, with its spitting abilities sourced from a rattle snake and a fire hydrant.\n\nThe discovery of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds suggests that dinosaurs might have had a similar capacity for communication, hinting at a more complex vocal repertoire than previously imagined. However, the definitive nature of dinosaur sounds remains speculative, with the possibility that some dinosaurs, like the ostrich-like dinosaurs, could have produced low-frequency, throaty vocalizations during mating displays or territorial calls.\n\nAs the field of dinosaur vocalization continues to evolve, researchers are uncovering intriguing aspects of these ancient creatures, challenging popular perceptions and offering a glimpse into a more nuanced world of prehistoric communication.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch.

The committee found that the Obama administration initially blamed the attack on an anti-Islam video, which was later contradicted by evidence suggesting it was a well-planned terrorist act, possibly linked to al-Qaeda affiliates. \n\nThe report exposes discrepancies between the public statements and private communications of top administration officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who initially attributed the violence to a protest over an internet video, despite knowing that it was a terrorist attack. The report also accuses the administration of providing a false narrative to the public, with Clinton's initial statement mentioning a protest as the primary reason, while private communications acknowledged the involvement of Islamic extremists.\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, criticized the committee's chairman, Trey Gowdy, for attempting to prevent accountability and transparency. Cummings argues that the report does not significantly alter the public's understanding of the attack, stating that the facts remain consistent: there was no stand-down order, no attempt to politicize the situation, and no evidence of gun trading or a protest-related origin for the violence.\n\nThe report includes new criticisms of Clinton and her administration for not adequately addressing the rise of extremism in Libya and for their handling of intelligence, with some accusing them of relying on flawed information.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration.

A source tells UK magazine Look the actor sent Holmes an \"emotional letter\" looking to, at the very least, be friends again, Australia's News Network reports. \"It's like he's finally recognized that Katie will always be the love of his life,\" the source says. Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one.

{"pred": "Billionaire couple Barry and Honey Sherman, founders of the Canadian pharmaceutical company Apotex, were found dead in their Toronto mansion under suspicious circumstances. The police initially described the deaths as \"ligature neck compression,\" suggesting suicide or murder-suicide, though their family denied these claims, stating that the rumors surrounding the incident were irresponsible. The couple, who were set to embark on their annual trip to Florida, were last seen planning their vacation and showing enthusiasm for life. The police found no signs of forced entry and no note explaining the deaths, leading to a homicide investigation by the Toronto police. Friends and colleagues remember Barry as a workaholic who loved Apotex, while Honey was a philanthropist known for her social engagements and recent dedication to their grandchild. The couple's financial status and lack of any apparent problems suggest a sudden and unexpected turn of events. As the investigation progresses, the community is left in shock, with tributes pouring in from public figures like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Toronto Mayor John Tory. The Shermans' deaths have raised questions about the nature of their deaths and the impact on their family, friends, and the pharmaceutical industry.", "answers": ["The investigation into the mysterious deaths of a billionaire and his wife is now being led by homicide detectives, police say—suggesting the deaths of Barry and Honey Sherman were either murder-suicide or a double murder.

Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists.

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country held its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to lead, followed by the more conservative Nour party. The elections, held amidst ongoing unrest and a slowing economy, are a crucial step in the transition since the fall of former President Hosni Mubarak. Mubarak's trial continued, with prosecutors accusing him of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression, aiming for his conviction. The court heard evidence that Mubarak sought to install his son Gamal in power, and the ex-president faces charges of corruption and conspiracy to kill protesters.\n\nThe military-controlled government is under pressure from both the newly elected parliament and protesters demanding a faster transition to civilian rule. The Brotherhood's goal is to form a coalition government, while the military's influence remains a point of contention. Economic challenges, including a decline in foreign currency reserves and a struggling stock market, loom large in the backdrop of these political developments.\n\nIn the Mubarak trial, the prosecution demanded a harsh penalty, painting a picture of the former president as a tyrant. The trial's outcome could impact the balance of power in the new parliament, with the Brotherhood aiming to maintain a coalition government to avoid an Islamist-dominated administration. The military's role in governance is also at stake, with the new parliament expected to challenge the military's authority.\n\nThe elections and trials have exposed divisions within Egyptian society, with the Brotherhood's rise and the desire for a more balanced political landscape. As the country moves forward, the economy's recovery and the prosecution's efforts to hold Mubarak accountable for past abuses will be key factors in determining Egypt's future direction.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
{"pred": "In an unusual incident, a Toyota Corolla driven by Nabila Altahan became suspended from a telephone pole in Mendon, Massachusetts, after the driver followed a GPS navigation system's unexpected command. The event occurred when Altahan, who was traveling westbound on Route 4, received directions to turn around due to the car having already passed its destination. Reacting too quickly to the GPS instruction, the car veered off the road and onto a telephone wire support. Fortunately, both Altahan and her passenger sustained no injuries. A witness reported seeing the driver exit the vehicle as it dangled from the pole.

{"pred": "Recent research has uncovered a concerning link between cigarette smoke and the virulence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke increases MRSA's resistance to antibiotics and impairs the effectiveness of the immune system in combating the bacteria. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes more adherent to human cells and develops a higher tolerance to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it harder to kill.\n\nIn a previous study, e-cigarette vapor was also found to affect bacterial resistance, but the impact was less severe compared to cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke acts as an alarm for MRSA, activating its defense mechanisms and enhancing its ability to survive and invade host cells. This heightened resistance persists for at least 24 hours, potentially allowing MRSA to multiply and cause more severe infections in smokers.\n\nThese findings contribute to the understanding that smoking not only poses health risks to smokers but also aids pathogens in becoming more resilient. The research highlights the importance of addressing the dual threat of cigarette smoke to both human health and the persistence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from the previous year's count by that time. The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a viral illness, such as enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), which was implicated in the 2014 outbreak.\n\nAFM cases have been reported in 17 states, with some physicians observing a surge in activity, particularly in California, Kansas, Missouri, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, and possibly others. The condition is characterized by sudden onset of limb weakness, respiratory issues, and sometimes paralysis. Treatment options are limited, with physical therapy and experimental treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and possibly Prozac being discussed. Recovery rates for children vary, with partial recovery in most cases but full recovery being uncommon.\n\nThe cause of AFM remains uncertain, with EV-D68 being a suspect in the past, but no definitive link has been established. In 2014, EV-D68 was associated with the outbreak, but this year, no widespread EV-D68 outbreak has been reported. Some experts believe that the condition could be related to enteroviruses, which are more common in late summer and early fall.\n\nThe 2014 outbreak saw 120 cases, primarily in children, while the number of cases in 2016 has already surpassed that. Parents and healthcare professionals are expressing concern about the potential for a repeat of the 2014 situation. While the CDC is investigating the rise in cases, they emphasize that AFM is still a rare condition, with most cases concentrated in children.\n\nParents of affected children, like Robin Roberts and Angie Andersen, are frustrated by the lack of knowledge about the condition and the need for more research.

Researchers from Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Pavia, led by Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth using a combination of live subject tests and simulations. Their study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, challenges the authenticity of the shroud by revealing inconsistencies in the blood flow patterns.\n\nThe researchers found that the bloodstains on the shroud do not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion scenario. Bloodstains on the left forearm and hand suggest a standing position, while the wound patterns on the torso and back are inconsistent with each other. The spear wound, for instance, did not form the solid stain typically associated with a crucifixion, and the blood flow from the lower back was not replicated in the tests. These findings imply that the shroud's image may not represent a crucified individual but rather a standing model or a \"didactic\" representation from the 14th century.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin, housed in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, has long been a subject of fascination and debate. While the cloth's radiocarbon dating places it within a timeframe compatible with the life of Jesus, the forensic analysis casts doubt on its historical significance. The shroud's authenticity remains uncertain, and the scientific community continues to seek answers through forensic techniques, although the investigation's results have raised questions about its authenticity.\n\nThe study adds to the ongoing debate surrounding the shroud and contributes to the scientific mystery surrounding its creation.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

This site, one of the best-preserved from that era, reveals a sophisticated civilization with levelled architecture similar to post-war housing, indicating it was likely a temporary structure for gatherings rather than a permanent residence. Finds include flint tools, pottery, and a pig bone-rich layer suggesting feasting and possibly agricultural practices. The site's vastness hints at its symbolic significance, possibly representing power and wealth through the mobilization of a large workforce.\n\nSimultaneously, at Wilsford Henge, another Bronze Age site, a 4,000-year-old child's skeleton was discovered, adorned with an amber necklace.

Named after the Mandarin words for \"rainbow\" and \"big crest,\" Caihong had a mix of dinosaur and bird-like features, including crested head, Velociraptor-like skull, and possibly bird-like feathers for flight, although its ability to fly is debated.\n\nThe dinosaur's body was mostly covered in dark feathers, while its head and neck sported iridescent ribbon-like feathers. Caihong's dinosaurian traits included a long snout, a crested skull, and a long, slender tail with feathers that suggest it may have had a frond-shaped tail for display or flight. The dinosaur's feathers, including those on its head, neck, and chest, were found to have melanosomes, which are indicative of colorful pigmentation.\n\nThe study, published in Nature Communications, compares Caihong to other early paravians, revealing a mix of similarities and differences. Its feathers, particularly the tail feathers, are the largest and most well-preserved in the fossil record, resembling those of the earliest known bird, Archaeopteryx. The presence of iridescent feathers suggests a more colorful world during the Jurassic than previously thought.\n\nWhile Caihong's feathers indicate a possible role in attracting mates or providing insulation, the dinosaur's unique crest and asymmetric tail feathers hint at a combination of display and functional aspects. The discovery pushes the understanding of dinosaur plumage and its potential functions, as well as the evolution of coloration in early paravians.\n\nOverall, the find represents a significant step in our knowledge of dinosaur diversity and the development of colorful displays in prehistoric creatures, potentially signaling social or sexual selection.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

{"pred": "In 2018, Seattle implemented a 1.75 cent per ounce tax on sweetened beverages, aiming to reduce sugar consumption, fund community college programs, and support healthy food purchases for low-income families. However, the tax faced significant opposition due to its regressive nature, with critics arguing that it led to price hikes, loss of revenue, and migration of customers to neighboring areas. Retail giants like Costco responded by prominently displaying the tax impact, causing a public backlash. The tax exempted beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, prompting Starbucks to refuse the tax. Seattle's tax has been compared to a failed experiment in Cook County, Illinois, which repealed its soda tax within months due to public uproar.\n\nSeattle's soda tax had unintended consequences, with prices doubling for items like Gatorade, leading to a shift in consumer behavior and revenue loss. The tax's opponents, including Bernie Sanders, libertarians, labor unions, and businesses, united against it, citing job losses and regressive effects on low-income households. Seattle's neighboring suburbs saw a boost in sales as shoppers avoided the tax.\n\nIn related news, a similar tax in Cook County, Illinois, was repealed after facing heavy opposition from the beverage industry, resulting in a significant drop in sales and calls for a more consistent application of the tax. The tax's complexity and lack of clarity on exemptions fueled public frustration.\n\nThe debate over soda taxes highlights the challenge of using pricing as a tool for public health goals, as it often leads to unintended consequences and resistance. While proponents argue for reducing sugar consumption and funding public health initiatives, opponents argue that taxes are regressive and can drive consumers to cheaper alternatives outside city limits.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The study, based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data, found that younger patients were more likely to have advanced tumors and were treated more aggressively, with higher rates of surgery and radiation therapy. Although younger patients had more advanced disease upon diagnosis, they tended to live slightly longer without recurrence due to earlier detection and treatment.\n\nThe study highlights the need for earlier screening recommendations, as younger patients are diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a higher rate and with more advanced stages. This shift calls for a reevaluation of current guidelines, which currently advise starting screenings at age 50. Some experts suggest that family history and certain risk factors might warrant earlier screenings, particularly for those with a genetic predisposition.\n\nThe increasing number of colorectal cancer cases in younger adults raises questions about environmental factors and the need to investigate potential contributors like smoking, obesity, and poor diet. While the exact reasons for the rising trend are not fully understood, researchers emphasize the importance of recognizing early symptoms, such as anemia, unusual bowel movements, and dark blood in stool, as indicators for evaluation.\n\nDespite the more aggressive disease presentation in younger patients, their survival rates were slightly better, especially in localized cancers. However, the cost-benefit of lowering the recommended screening age remains uncertain, as the risk of cancer in younger individuals is still lower than in older adults.\n\nThe findings prompt a call to action for the medical community to be vigilant in identifying and addressing colorectal cancer in younger patients, potentially leading to earlier intervention and improved outcomes.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The shelter contains sophisticated stone tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, suggesting a complex relationship between humans and large animals like the extinct giant wombat. The presence of these findings pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the arid zone, challenging the conventional belief that the first Australians arrived around 50,000 years ago. The excavation methods were meticulous, with hand excavation, stratigraphic analysis, and careful documentation of artifacts and bone fragments. Optical dating techniques and Bayesian age modeling were employed to establish a chronology, revealing a sequence of occupation between 49,000 and 46,000 years ago. The site also marks the earliest known use of ochre and certain technological advancements, such as bone and stone tools, in the region. The discovery supports the theory that humans, not just climate change, played a role in the extinction of megafauna, as evidenced by the coexistence of human remains and megafaunal bones.

{"pred": "This summary highlights the concept of galactic-scale energy acquisition and the search for advanced civilizations in the universe, as outlined in two news passages. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev's three-step model of technological advancement, known as the Kardashev Scale, suggests that civilizations progress from Type I (planet-bound), through Type II (star-bound), to Type III (galaxy-bound) by harvesting resources, energy, and eventually the energy of entire galaxies. \n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, proposes that as civilizations advance, they would inevitably face the challenge of dark energy-driven cosmic isolation. As the universe expands, stars beyond our Local Group become inaccessible, necessitating the capture of energy from distant stars. To achieve this, Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations would construct massive structures like Dyson spheres, composed of solar-powered satellites, to collect and redirect starlight back to their home planets or even propel stars themselves.\n\nScience fiction has long explored such concepts, with Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker\" and Freeman Dyson's proposal of energy-harvesting shells. Dyson spheres, envisioned as clouds of statites or rigid structures, would surround stars to capture and distribute their energy. The scale of these structures indicates that advanced civilizations, potentially millions of years ahead of humanity, might be in the process of capturing stars for their energy needs.\n\nThe search for these civilizations involves looking for anomalies, such as stars being accelerated due to energy extraction, or unusual light signatures in galaxies' spectra, which could indicate the presence of alien mega-projects. However, current technology limits our ability to detect such signatures conclusively.\n\nIn conclusion, the quest to dominate the universe and the search for advanced civilizations are intertwined with the challenges of energy acquisition and the expanding nature of the cosmos. As humanity continues to contemplate its own potential future expansion, the possibility of encountering other technologically advanced races looms, with their energy-harvesting endeavors serving as both a sign of their existence and a cautionary tale about the cosmic race against dark energy.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "A series of groundbreaking discoveries in the field of paleoanthropology challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors. Researchers, using data from three papers published in Science, suggest that dramatic shifts in East African climate around 320,000 years ago may have catalyzed toolmaking advancements and trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. The excavated Middle Stone Age tools, the oldest of their kind, indicate a gradual transition from simpler handheld tools to more specialized, long-distance traded obsidian-based implements. These changes suggest increased mobility, resource acquisition, and social networking among hominid populations.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya reveals a timeline of climate-driven behavioral changes, with evidence of smaller, more versatile tools and the import of obsidian from afar. While it is uncertain if Homo sapiens or a related species created these tools, the presence of obsidian and pigment trade indicates the possibility of inter-group communication and collaboration. The development of these tools and trading networks is seen as a key factor in the success of early Homo sapiens in adapting to unpredictable landscapes.\n\nThe research also connects the rise of Middle Stone Age tools with the emergence of Homo sapiens, around 300,000 years ago, possibly due to climate fluctuations that forced hominids to expand their foraging territories and engage in long-distance interactions. However, other factors like population dynamics and environmental pressures might have also influenced tool innovations.\n\nThe study challenges the traditional view of a \"human revolution\" around 40,000-50,000 years ago, suggesting that components of modern behaviors, such as technological advancements and cultural exchange, emerged much earlier, possibly as early as 300,000 years ago. The Olorgesailie discoveries, along with other sites across Africa, call for a reevaluation of the criteria used to distinguish modern humans from their ancestors, highlighting a gradual progression of complex behaviors and innovations that predate the arrival of Homo sapiens. Further research is needed to clarify the exact relationship between these early developments and the rise of Homo sapiens, as well as the extent to which these behaviors were unique to our species or shared among other hominids.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The case challenges the traditional understanding of habeas corpus, a legal procedure that ensures the prevention of indefinite detention without cause, typically applied to humans.\n\nThe Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006, which revoked habeas corpus for certain individuals labeled \"enemy combatants,\" has been criticized for undermining legal protections.

Gibson's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, maintained that the company had purchased wood legally, but the government's investigation, based on emails cited in a court motion, suggested otherwise. The company was accused of knowingly sourcing wood from countries like Madagascar, despite the ban on exports due to concerns over illegal harvesting.\n\nEnvironmental Investigation Agency (EIA) Director Andrea Johnson confirmed that the Lacey Act requires end-users of endangered wood, like Gibson, to verify the legality of their supply chain.

{"pred": "Recent studies have shed new light on the water history of Mars, revealing a massive ancient ocean that once covered a significant portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. This ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, was comparable to the Atlantic Ocean on Earth and persisted for millions of years, providing a potentially habitable environment. The ocean's existence is inferred from maps of atmospheric water vapor, which show a high concentration of deuterium, indicating extensive water loss over time. Mars' early climate allowed for the formation of large bodies of water, including lakes, deltas, and possibly even seas, supporting the idea that the planet was more conducive to life than previously believed.\n\nThe ocean, which reached depths of up to a mile, was initially formed by the immense amount of water that Mars had, with a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. This water loss, primarily due to the thinning Martian atmosphere, led to the retention of deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen, resulting in a higher D/H ratio compared to Earth's oceans. The presence of this heavy water suggests Mars had a substantial water inventory in its past.\n\nThe discovery challenges earlier assumptions about the sporadic nature of water on Mars, favoring a more continuous and widespread presence. Astronomers, using powerful telescopes, have confirmed that the planet's polar ice caps are enriched in deuterium, indicating a vast amount of water loss. This water loss corresponds to an ocean that covered about 20% of the planet's surface, with the majority likely concentrated in the northern lowlands.\n\nThe findings support the possibility of habitability on Mars, although the exact extent of water and its role in supporting life remain speculative. The presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere, though not necessarily indicative of current life, adds to the intrigue. As the search for life on Mars intensifies, future missions, such as the Exomars rover, will continue to explore the planet's potential for past or present habitability.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Despite the film's glossy appearance and the undeniable chemistry between Smith and Robbie, the plot falls flat due to its absurdity, particularly in scenes involving extravagant heists and implausible resolutions.\n\nSmith's performance, while showcasing his charm, is limited by a lackluster script that prevents him from delivering a memorable romantic role. The film's supporting cast, such as B.D. Wong and Adrian Martinez, contribute some entertaining moments, but overall, \"Focus\" is a disappointing endeavor that relies on its stars' charisma without offering substantial substance or depth.\n\nThe original concept of the movie seemed to aim for a sophisticated, old-school con man story, reminiscent of classic films like \"The Sting\" or \"To Catch a Thief.\" However, the final product devolves into a predictable and unsatisfying tale, with a convoluted plot that struggles to maintain credibility.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic image of the T. rex's roar, suggesting that the dinosaur likely didn't sound like the fierce, high-pitched creature portrayed in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" Scientists argue that the T. rex, along with other dinosaurs, may have produced sounds more akin to today's birds, such as cooing or a low, throaty mumble. These closed-mouth vocalizations, which involve air sacs and esophageal pouches, are believed to have evolved 16 times within the archosaur lineage, including birds and crocodiles. The study, published in the journal Evolution, points to the possibility that dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies, might have communicated using sounds similar to cooing ostriches or doves.\n\nIn the realm of dinosaur sound design, the 1993 film \"Jurassic Park\" employed a mix of real animal sounds to create the fictional dinos. Velociraptors' calls were influenced by mating tortoises, while the T. rex's roar was a composite of baby elephant, tiger, and alligator noises. The study also reveals that the iconic T. rex sound, famously created by blending various animal sounds, may not reflect reality.\n\nThe research underscores the mystery surrounding dinosaur vocalizations, as most of their vocal organs would have been soft tissues that did not fossilize. However, the study suggests that dinosaurs might have had air sacs and possibly a bird-like syrinx, enabling them to produce low-frequency vocalizations like coos or hoots, especially in large-bodied dinosaurs.\n\nThe Jurassic World franchise, including the velociraptors, relied on real-life animal sounds for inspiration, with the raptors' communication involving a tortoise's mating call and a goose's aggressive hiss. The T. rex's menacing growl, though, was a creative mix of various animal noises.\n\nThe discovery of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and the likelihood of their dinosaur ancestors having similar abilities adds a new layer to our understanding of prehistoric life. While the exact dinosaur sounds remain a mystery, the study paves the way for future research combining paleontology, comparative biology, and sound design to piece together a more accurate picture of dinosaur vocalizations.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The report highlights a concern expressed by State Department officials during the attack that Marines' uniforms might hinder diplomacy, leading to discussions about the possibility of them wearing civilian clothing. The committee disputes the administration's initial narrative, stating that the attack was not caused by an anti-Islam video but rather by a well-planned terrorist operation linked to al-Qaeda affiliates. The report also accuses the Obama administration of providing false statements to the public, with top officials, including Secretary Clinton, initially suggesting the violence was due to a protest over an internet video, despite knowing it was a terrorist attack.\n\nThe report includes a timeline contrasting public and private statements, showing discrepancies in the administration's official narrative. It reveals that Clinton's initial statement conflated the attack with a protest, while private communications acknowledged the involvement of al-Qaeda-affiliated groups and the lack of a protest-related cause. The report questions the administration's handling of intelligence and the role of the video in shaping public discourse, with some officials attempting to downplay its significance.\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, criticized the committee's chairman, Trey Gowdy, for hindering transparency and preventing the release of certain information. Cummings argues that the report does not fundamentally change the public's understanding of the attack, but adds granularity to the facts, confirming no stand-down order, no attempt to politicize the situation, and no evidence of gun trading.\n\nThe report concludes with a focus on the administration's misrepresentation of events, particularly in blaming the violence on the video, which was later determined to be a cover for a premeditated terrorist attack.

How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

The elections, which took place amidst ongoing trials of former President Hosni Mubarak, saw Mubarak's trial resume with prosecutors accusing him of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression. The military-controlled government faces opposition from protesters demanding an end to military rule and an accelerated transition to civilian leadership.\n\nThe Brotherhood aims to form a coalition or unity government, while also attempting to balance their influence with secular parties. Economic challenges persist, with Egypt experiencing a decline in foreign currency reserves and a struggling stock market. The outcome of the elections could impact the power dynamics between the military, Brotherhood, and other political factions.\n\nIn Mubarak's trial, the prosecution presented a strong case against him, branding him a tyrant and implicating him in the deaths of protesters. The court adjourned to consider the prosecution's argument, which could lead to a harsh penalty. Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa, also face corruption charges.\n\nThe military's role in governance remains contentious, with the new Parliament expected to challenge the military's authority, particularly over the selection of a new president by June.

A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party.

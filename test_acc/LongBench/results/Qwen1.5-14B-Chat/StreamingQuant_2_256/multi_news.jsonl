{"pred": "Recent research has revealed a concerning connection between cigarette smoke and the persistence and virulence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke increases MRSA's resistance to antibiotics and impairs the effectiveness of the immune system in combating the bacteria. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes more adept at repelling reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it harder to kill. The bacteria can adhere better to human cells, facilitating their invasion. A similar effect was observed with e-cigarette smoke, but the resistance increase was more pronounced in MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke acts as an alarm for MRSA, activating its defense mechanisms, thereby enhancing its survival and virulence.

The study's authors, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, emphasize the need for further understanding of this phenomenon to inform public health strategies and discourage smoking, particularly in healthcare settings where MRSA infections are prevalent.

As of August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed 32 cases across the country, a sharp rise from the previous year's count by that time. The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a viral illness, such as enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), though the exact cause remains uncertain.\n\nIn 2014, a surge of AFM cases, also linked to EV-D68, left 120 children paralyzed, with only a minority fully recovering. This year, the CDC is observing a steady increase in reports, with some experts suggesting a possible recurrence of the 2014 outbreak. While no specific treatment has shown marked improvement, cases have been reported in at least 17 states, with California, Kansas, and Colorado experiencing a surge in EV-D68 infections.\n\nThe lack of a definitive cure or preventive measure highlights the urgency for more research. Some doctors have experimented with treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and Prozac, but the long-term prognosis remains uncertain. Parents and healthcare professionals are concerned about the potential for a repeat of the 2014 outbreak, with no clear explanation for the sudden rise in cases.\n\nIn addition to EV-D68, other enteroviruses have been implicated, but the connection is not conclusive. The rarity of the condition, with only a few hundred cases annually, makes it challenging to track and understand. The 2014 outbreak led to increased surveillance, but the cause remains a medical mystery.\n\nParents, like Robin Roberts and Angie Andersen, whose children were affected, are frustrated by the lack of information and the need for more research. The condition has left some children paralyzed, highlighting the need for better understanding and potential prevention strategies.

However, the military's failure to fight back against the rebels has accelerated the situation. The coup leaders claim they aim to address Mali's security issues, but their actions have worsened the situation.\n\nThe international community, including the United Nations, has yet to fully engage, emphasizing the urgency of outside support to prevent the collapse of Mali's state. The crisis has also affected the tourism-dependent city of Timbuktu, with UNESCO warning that the fighting could damage the UNESCO World Heritage site, including its unique mud and wood architecture.\n\nFuel shortages and economic sanctions imposed by regional neighbors have led to fuel queues in Bamako, with the junta's inability to defend the country exacerbating the crisis. The rebels' advances have prompted fears of a divided Mali, with the junta's promise of a transition to democratic elections seen as uncertain.\n\nNegotiations between the junta and the MNLA are ongoing, but the rebels' desire for independence or strict Islamic governance complicates the situation. The international community's response is crucial, as the crisis threatens not only Mali but also neighboring countries and the broader Sahel region.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the Malian military faces a critical task in regaining control and preventing further territorial losses.

The organization highlights the devastating effects of institutional care on children's development, with increased risks of abuse, neglect, and lifelong consequences.\n\nLumos' work focuses on advocating for family-based care, such as fostering, adoption, and support for families, as the preferred alternative to institutions.

Rowling's #Letstalklumos campaign aims to keep the conversation going and raise funds to support the organization's mission.

The dossier's political funding and the FBI's failure to disclose its political origins, as well as Steele's termination due to unauthorized media contacts, are highlighted as issues of concern.

{"pred": "In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have found a new dinosaur species, Caihong juji, a crow-sized, bird-like creature with iridescent feathers from the Jurassic period in northeastern China. Named after the Mandarin words for \"rainbow\" and \"big crest,\" the dinosaur had vibrant feathers, particularly on its head, neck, and chest, which displayed colors similar to those of hummingbirds. The feathers, analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, revealed melanosomes, the pigment-producing structures, suggesting a rainbow-like appearance. Caihong had a theropod body with a Velociraptor-like skull and crested head, but its feathers indicate a possible connection to early birds, with asymmetrical feathers suggesting a role in aerodynamics.\n\nThe dinosaur's feathers were not only colorful but also diverse, ranging from linear and pennaceous to sinuous and sinuous barbs. Its relatively short, robust dentary and the presence of iridescent feathers on its head and neck suggest a combination of display and possibly even flight capabilities, though the latter is debated. The dinosaur's small size and proportionally short limbs indicate it may have been a ground dweller, with a probable function for its feathers in attracting mates or displaying during courtship.\n\nCaihong's fossil discovery provides insights into the evolution of feather diversity and coloration in paravians, with its feathers occupying a unique position in the morphospace of fossil melanosomes. The presence of iridescent feathers in a dinosaur predating the origin of birds challenges our understanding of dinosaur displays and raises questions about the function of such vibrant plumage.\n\nThe dinosaur's skeleton, including its relatively short tail and asymmetrical feathers, hints at the early development of aerodynamic adaptations in feathers. While it cannot be definitively concluded whether Caihong could fly, its discovery emphasizes the complexity and diversity of feathered dinosaurs, pushing back the timeline of colorful and potentially flight-related feathers in the Jurassic.\n\nOverall, the Caihong juji fossil represents a rare glimpse into the colorful world of prehistoric life, offering new perspectives on the evolution of feather diversity and the potential roles of feathers in dinosaur behavior and biology.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

However, the tax faced significant opposition due to its regressive nature, with critics arguing that it led to price hikes, loss of revenue, and migration of customers to neighboring areas. Retail giants like Costco adjusted their pricing, with some products seeing drastic increases, causing a public backlash. The tax exempted beverages with milk as the primary ingredient, prompting Starbucks to refuse the tax. Seattle's tax also fueled debates about its fairness and potential unintended consequences.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar tax was repealed within two months due to public uproar, with businesses experiencing a decline in sales and customers leaving the affected areas. The tax's opponents, including Bernie Sanders, libertarians, labor unions, and businesses, argued that it was a job-killing measure that united them against it.\n\nSeattle's tax also faced criticism for not applying consistently, as it excluded certain beverages like those sold at Starbucks. The tax's effectiveness in improving public health was questioned, with opponents suggesting that better education and addressing the root causes of health issues would be more effective.\n\nIn other news, the tax led to a spike in prices at Costco, with some products doubling in cost. The backlash prompted the retailer to inform customers about cheaper alternatives outside the city.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear.

Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer, made headlines when he appeared on CNN, where he questioned the credibility of polls indicating a decline in Trump's popularity compared to Hillary Clinton. During an interview, Cohen repeatedly asked, \"Says who?\" in response to claims about Trump's low poll numbers, expressing skepticism and demanding evidence.\n\nThe interview took place amidst a shake-up in Trump's campaign team, with the addition of Breitbart News' CEO Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager. Cohen defended the changes, stating that the campaign was not ready for Conway's appointment earlier but believed she was a valuable asset. Despite the shake-up, Cohen's response to the polls fueled a humorous meme on social media, with users jokingly repeating \"Says who?\" in response to his queries.\n\nThe CNN segment highlighted the tension between Cohen and the media, as he challenged the narrative that Trump was trailing in the polls.

House Speaker John Boehner faces pressure from conservative Republicans to push for a fight over the health law, but a shutdown could result if a compromise is not reached.\n\nDemocrats are using Reid's strategy, which involves refusing to budge on the ACA, believing that the political fallout from a shutdown would disproportionately harm Republicans. Senate Democrats are expected to reject the House's bill, and President Obama's administration is not expected to engage in direct negotiations with House Republicans over the weekend, as suggested by Reid.

{"pred": "A recent analysis of colorectal cancer data from the University of Michigan has revealed a concerning trend: one in every seven colorectal cancer cases now affects individuals under the age of 50, challenging the conventional belief that the disease predominantly affects older adults. This shift, evident in a study examining over 258,000 patients between 1998 and 2011, highlights the need for reevaluating screening guidelines, as younger patients tend to present with more advanced disease and require different treatment approaches. Younger patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer were found to have a higher likelihood of surgery and radiation therapy, and they experienced slightly longer survival without recurrence compared to older patients, despite having more aggressive disease at diagnosis.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of being vigilant for colorectal cancer symptoms in younger adults, as they may be less aware of the \"silent\" signs, such as anemia, unusual bowel movements, and dark blood in stool. Researchers suggest that doctors should consider family history and individual risk factors when deciding on screening, potentially starting earlier than age 50 for high-risk individuals.\n\nWhile the exact reasons for the rising incidence in younger patients remain unclear, factors like environmental influences, lifestyle choices like smoking, obesity, and poor diet may contribute. Some experts argue that guidelines may need to be revised, but the cost-benefit ratio of earlier screening for younger adults is uncertain.\n\nThe findings stress the need for the medical community to adapt to the growing number of young colorectal cancer survivors, who will require long-term support for both physical and emotional well-being.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

Astrophysicist Dan Hooper's paper, based on Nikolai Kardashev's three-stage model, suggests that civilizations aiming to expand and secure energy resources would eventually move from harvesting their own planet's resources (Type I) to nearby stars (Type II) to combat the expanding universe's isolation. To achieve this, they would potentially construct massive Dyson spheres or swarms of solar-powered satellites, like Stapledon's \"star makers,\" to capture and harness star energy.\n\nHooper proposes that advanced civilizations would prioritize capturing stars before they become inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of the universe caused by dark energy. This would involve constructing Dyson spheres or statite-like structures, which could be detected through unusual light signatures in the form of infrared radiation or specific wavelengths in the galaxy's energy output.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres and other advanced engineering feats, such as those described by Olaf Stapledon and Freeman Dyson, have been discussed in science fiction and now gain traction in scientific speculation. While humanity is currently at a relatively early stage of technological advancement, the possibility of encountering older, more advanced civilizations harvesting stars suggests a race against time to secure energy sources before the effects of dark energy render them unreachable.\n\nAs scientists continue to explore the cosmos, the search for these extraterrestrial constructs could provide valuable insights into the capabilities and ambitions of potential alien life forms.

Initially, Oakleigh, born premature at 3 pounds, fought her way to recovery and appeared healthy until she developed a fever and was diagnosed with stage 3 kidney reflux, a condition where bacteria can enter the kidneys, causing infections. The bacteria found in her case is a dangerous, antibiotic-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has led to a series of hospitalizations.\n\nPseudomonas infections are common in hospitals and can affect individuals with weakened immune systems. Oakleigh's case highlights the challenge of treating infections with this superbug, as it resists multiple antibiotics. She has also been found to have moderate aortic septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary stenosis, adding complexity to her care.\n\nDespite the recent diagnosis of a critical E. coli infection, which is particularly concerning due to its resistance to antibiotics, Oakleigh's family remains hopeful. She is scheduled for surgery to address her kidney issue, aiming to prevent future infections.

Researchers, using data from three papers published in Science, suggest that dramatic shifts in East African climate around 320,000 years ago may have catalyzed toolmaking advancements and trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. The excavated Middle Stone Age tools, the oldest of their kind, indicate a gradual transition from simpler handheld tools to more specialized, long-distance traded obsidian-based implements, possibly signaling increased social networking and resource acquisition strategies.\n\nThese findings push back the timeline for the emergence of Middle Stone Age tools to around 320,000 years ago, earlier than previously estimated. The tools, with their smaller size and specialized designs, suggest a shift towards more complex thinking and problem-solving abilities. The presence of obsidian from distant locations hints at long-distance trade and cooperation among hominid populations.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, where these discoveries were made, experienced frequent environmental changes, which forced early humans to adapt by expanding their foraging territories and developing more efficient tools. The study also reveals evidence of pigment use, possibly indicating symbolic expression and social identity.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether the makers of these tools were exclusively Homo sapiens, the findings align with genetic evidence placing the origin of Homo sapiens in Africa around 300,000 years ago. The researchers argue that climate fluctuations, particularly in East Africa, played a significant role in shaping the cognitive and behavioral advancements of early humans.\n\nThe study also highlights the potential for social networking and resource-sharing among hominids during times of environmental stress, echoing modern human responses to crises. However, other factors like population dynamics and technological innovations may have contributed to these changes as well.\n\nThe Olorgesailie discoveries prompt a reevaluation of the \"human revolution,\" suggesting that key aspects of modern human behavior, such as tool-making, trade, and cultural expression, emerged much earlier than previously thought, possibly even before the rise of Homo sapiens.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

This unprecedented move treats the chimpanzees as legal persons, potentially granting them the right to a fair hearing to determine their continued captivity. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP), which filed the lawsuit, argues that the chimps' cognitive and emotional complexity merits their release from the laboratory and transfer to a sanctuary.\n\nThe ruling comes amidst a broader debate about the erosion of habeas corpus, a fundamental legal principle that ensures individuals are not held indefinitely without just cause. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 temporarily revoked habeas corpus rights for certain individuals labeled \"enemy combatants,\" including legal residents and non-citizens at Guantanamo Bay. The Supreme Court will soon review cases involving Guantanamo detainees, potentially reasserting the importance of habeas corpus in protecting individual liberties.\n\nThe case of the chimpanzees highlights the growing recognition of animal rights, particularly for highly intelligent species like chimpanzees, elephants, and cetaceans. NhRP aims to expand this argument, seeking to secure legal personhood and the right to bodily liberty for other captive animals, including research subjects, arguing that they possess autonomy and cognitive abilities similar to humans.\n\nWhile the Stony Brook case is a milestone, it is not without challenges.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Federal marshals seized wood during a raid at the company's facilities in Tennessee, targeting both the 2009 seizure of ebony from Madagascar and the enforcement of the Lacey Act, which extends protection to endangered plants like ebony and rosewood. The law requires end-users, including Gibson, to verify the legality of their supply chain, with the government alleging that the company took steps to maintain links to potentially illegal timber harvests.\n\nGibson denies these claims, stating that they have purchased legally sourced wood and stopped imports from Madagascar after a coup there. However, the company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, laments the impact on their business, with no formal charges despite the government's assertion that they are preparing to prosecute. The case has raised concerns among the guitar industry, with some, like Chris Martin of the C.F. Martin Guitar Company, supporting the Lacey Act as a means to combat illegal logging, while others criticize its retroactivity and potential effects on vintage instrument collectors.\n\nAttorney Ronald Bienstock warns that the law could affect the provenance of older guitars, and the issue has led to delays and uncertainties for collectors. The Environmental Investigation Agency's Andrea Johnson defends the act, emphasizing the need to ensure responsible sourcing and reduce illegal logging, even if it causes temporary inconvenience for businesses like Gibson, who are awaiting a resolution to clarify their compliance.

{"pred": "Recent studies have shed new light on the water history of Mars, revealing a massive ancient ocean that once covered a significant portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. Four billion years ago, Mars had a global ocean that was at least 20 million cubic kilometers in size, comparable to the Arctic Ocean on Earth, and reached depths of up to a mile. This extensive water body, which was primarily located in the low-lying areas, suggests a warmer and wetter Mars during its early days, supporting the idea that the planet had conditions conducive to the potential existence of life.\n\nThe research, conducted by NASA scientists using powerful infrared telescopes, has found that the planet lost a significant amount of water, equivalent to a global ocean covering nearly half of Mars. The maps of atmospheric water and its deuterium content indicate that Mars had a substantial water loss, with the polar reservoirs having an enriched D/H ratio, suggesting a global water layer at least 137 meters deep. This contrasts with earlier beliefs about the sporadic presence of water on Mars.\n\nThe presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere, detected by NASA's Curiosity rover, adds to the intrigue, although its origin remains uncertain. Some scientists speculate that it could be a sign of past or present microbial life, while others attribute it to geological processes.\n\nAs Mars lost its water due to atmospheric escape, the oceanic body shrank, leaving behind a thick ice layer in the polar regions. The discovery of a large ancient ocean on Mars strengthens the case for the possibility of habitable conditions and raises the likelihood of past habitability, although definitive evidence of life remains elusive.\n\nIn conclusion, recent findings have significantly revised our understanding of Mars' past climate and water availability, providing a more favorable environment for the search for past or extant life on the Red Planet. Future missions, such as the Exomars rover, will continue to explore these tantalizing hints of past habitability and the potential for life beyond Earth.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The movie's central con is revealed to be a shallow facade, with the film's reliance on Smith's charisma being its only redeeming factor.\n\nWhile the chemistry between Smith and Robbie is entertaining, particularly in a scene at a football game, the plot inconsistencies and exaggerated elements make the film seem absurd. The movie's extravagant setup, involving a large warehouse operation and a series of elaborate cons, fails to convince viewers of a realistic portrayal of the underground world it claims to depict.\n\nDespite the initial buzz surrounding potential casting choices like Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and various A-list actresses, Smith's performance as Nicky is praised for showcasing his natural charm and ability to exude confidence. However, the film's romantic subplot between Smith and Robbie is criticized for lacking emotional impact due to Smith's limited range as a leading man.\n\nWhile \"Focus\" has its moments of humor and visual appeal, it ultimately relies on its star power and a few well-choreographed scenes to entertain, rather than offering a substantial story or insight into the world of con artists.

Nestlé had been attempting to trademark the four-fingered wafer shape since 2002, arguing that it was distinctive enough to be protected. However, the court ruled that a previous decision to annul the trademark was correct, effectively ending Nestlé's protected status for the shape in the EU. This decision affects not only Kit Kat but also competitors like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which has been producing a similar snack since 1937. The ruling states that a trademark must demonstrate distinctiveness across all EU member states, not just a significant part, making it challenging for Nestlé to reapply with stronger evidence.\n\nThe Kit Kat case highlights the ongoing battle between Nestlé and Mondelez, with the latter contesting the trademark on various grounds. The ECJ's decision emphasizes the need for a product to be recognizable in every EU country for a trademark to be valid. The outcome has implications for other brands, such as Toblerone, whose shape is also trademarked, and could lead to increased competition in the chocolate market.\n\nIn related legal disputes, the case has been compared to other trademark battles, including Cadbury's attempt to trademark the purple color of its Dairy Milk chocolate and a previous gold-wrapped Easter bunny trademark dispute between Lindt and Riegelein. These cases further illustrate the complexities of protecting brand identities and shapes within the EU, with potential consequences for businesses operating across the single market.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic T. rex roar from popular culture, suggesting that the dinosaur likely didn't sound like the fierce, high-pitched creature portrayed in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" Scientists argue that the T. rex, if vocalizing, might have produced sounds more akin to those of birds, such as cooing or a low, throaty mumble. The study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzes the vocalizations of birds and crocodiles, revealing that closed-mouth sounds, like coos from birds with large esophageal pouches, could have been present in some dinosaur species. The researchers propose that these sounds, which are less frequency-intensive than open-mouthed chirping, might have been used for mating displays or territorial defense.\n\nThe study also highlights the possibility that some dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies, may have had the ability to produce bird-like vocalizations, with examples like ostriches and cassowaries. The team, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, aims to understand the evolution of bird vocalizations, which could shed light on dinosaur vocalizations as well. While the exact sounds of dinosaurs remain speculative due to lack of fossil evidence, the study suggests that dinosaurs might have had a diverse range of vocal abilities, including closed-mouth sounds that evolved independently in different lineages, including birds.\n\nIn the realm of Jurassic Park, the iconic film's sound design involved creative combinations of real-life animal sounds. Velociraptors' calls were influenced by mating tortoises, while the T. rex's roar was a mix of baby elephant, tiger, and alligator sounds, slowed down to create a more intimidating effect. The Dilophosaurus, known for its cute appearance, had a swan-like trill in the film, while the T. rex's roar was based on baby elephants.\n\nThe discovery of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds and the suggestion that dinosaurs might have possessed similar abilities adds a new layer of complexity to our understanding of prehistoric life.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The report highlights a concern expressed by State Department officials during the attack that Marines' uniforms might hinder diplomacy, leading to discussions about the possibility of them wearing civilian clothing. The committee disputes the administration's initial narrative, stating that the attack was not solely due to a protest over an anti-Islam video, as initially claimed. Instead, it suggests the attack was a well-planned act by terrorists, with some officials aware of this from the start.\n\nThe report also exposes discrepancies between the public statements made by top administration officials, particularly Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and their private communications. Clinton's statements initially attributed the violence to a protest over an anti-Muslim video, while private conversations revealed a more accurate understanding of the situation, with some officials linking the attack to al-Qaeda-affiliated groups.\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, criticized the committee's chairman, Trey Gowdy, for attempting to prevent accountability and transparency. Cummings argues that the report does not significantly alter the public's understanding of the events, maintaining that there was no stand-down order, no attempt to politicize the situation, and no evidence of gun trading or a video being the sole cause of the violence.\n\nThe report includes new criticisms of Clinton, stating that she and her team did not adequately address the rising extremism in Libya and intentionally misled the public about the Benghazi attack.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

A source tells UK magazine Look the actor sent Holmes an \"emotional letter\" looking to, at the very least, be friends again, Australia's News Network reports. \"It's like he's finally recognized that Katie will always be the love of his life,\" the source says. Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one.

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country held its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to lead, followed by the more conservative Nour party. The elections, held amidst ongoing unrest and a slowdown in economic growth, are a crucial step in the post-Hosni Mubarak era. Mubarak's trial continued, with prosecutors accusing him of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression, aiming for his conviction. The court heard that Mubarak sought to install his son Gamal in power, and the ex-president faces charges of corruption and conspiracy to kill protesters.\n\nThe military council remains in control, with elections planned to culminate in presidential polls by June. The outcome of the parliamentary vote could determine the balance of power, with the Brotherhood aiming for a majority to counterbalance the military and conservative forces. Economic challenges persist, with foreign currency reserves declining and the stock market experiencing significant losses.\n\nIn the Mubarak trial, the prosecution intensified its case, asking for a harsh penalty for the former president. The trial highlighted the struggle for power and accountability, with Mubarak's son Gamal's role in the regime coming under scrutiny. The military's control over the transition remains a point of contention, with protests and political maneuvering set to continue in the coming months.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes.

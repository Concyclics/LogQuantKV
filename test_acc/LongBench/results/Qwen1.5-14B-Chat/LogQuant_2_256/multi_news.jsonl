Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke increases the resistance of MRSA to antibiotics and impairs the effectiveness of the immune system in combating the bacteria. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes more adept at repelling reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it harder to kill. The enhanced resistance persists even after the bacteria have stopped being exposed to smoke, suggesting a lasting impact on their survival.\n\nIn a separate study, e-cigarette vapor was also found to affect MRSA's cell wall structure, though the extent of resistance was less than that caused by cigarette smoke. These findings imply that smoking, whether traditional or vaping, can make superbugs like MRSA more aggressive and pose a greater threat to public health. Cigarette smokers are already known to be at higher risk for infections, and this new evidence adds another layer of complexity, as smoke exposure not only weakens the immune system of the smoker but also strengthens the bacteria they harbor.\n\nThese discoveries highlight the need for further understanding of the interplay between environmental factors and bacterial resistance, emphasizing the importance of quitting smoking to reduce the risk of infections and the spread of antibiotic-resistant diseases.

The condition primarily affects children, with an average age of 7, and often follows a viral illness, such as enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), though the exact cause remains uncertain.\n\nIn 2014, there was a surge in AFM cases, with 120 confirmed in the US, leading to concerns about a potential repeat of the 2014 outbreak. While EV-D68 was initially suspected, no definitive link has been established. This year, no widespread EV-D68 outbreak has been reported, but some doctors suspect a correlation between AFM and enterovirus infections.\n\nThe condition presents with symptoms like fever, respiratory issues, and rapidly progressing paralysis, often affecting limbs and sometimes requiring respiratory support. Treatment options are limited, with physical therapy and experimental treatments like intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and possibly Prozac being discussed. Recovery rates for children vary, with only a minority fully recovering.\n\nParents and healthcare professionals are concerned about the rising number of cases, particularly among children, with at least four states reporting multiple cases, including California, Massachusetts, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia. The CDC is urging vigilance and monitoring of the situation, as the condition is predominantly seen in children, but can also affect adults.\n\nThe rarity of AFM, with only a few hundred cases reported since the CDC began tracking in 2014, highlights the need for more research into its causes and effective treatments. Some promising developments include studies on mice with EV-D68 suggesting a potential link, and Dr. Max Wiznitzer's research on using IVIG as a potential therapy.\n\nAffected families, like the Roberts and Andersen households, share their stories of sudden illness and the devastating impact on their children's lives.

Researchers, led by Matteo Borrini from Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences, analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth using live subjects and a mannequin. Their Bloodstain Pattern Analysis revealed inconsistencies with the traditional crucifixion scenario, suggesting that the stains do not match the expected patterns of a crucified or hanging individual. The study found that the bloodstains on the Shroud are not consistent with a single position, pointing to a standing model being used to create the imprints, rather than a crucified or dead body. The researchers observed discrepancies in angles and flow directions, particularly in the hand, forearm, and spear wound patterns, which do not align with the standard crucifixion scenario.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin, housed in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, has long been a subject of debate due to its age, radiocarbon dating placing it between 1260 and 1390 CE, and the image of a crucified man. While the shroud's authenticity remains uncertain, the forensic analysis adds to the ongoing discussion about its origins and the possibility that it may be a medieval creation, possibly intended as a didactic or artistic representation.\n\nDespite the findings, the investigation does not definitively prove the shroud's inauthenticity, and further scientific inquiry is needed to fully understand the techniques used to create the image.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

The first passage highlights the challenges people face in obtaining traditional loans and introduces '1 hour 2 hours no credit money' as a solution for those in need of fast cash, often for urgent expenses like electricity bills, medical emergencies, and car-related issues. These loans, however, come with interest rates and fees, emphasizing the importance of planning and understanding the costs involved.\n\nThe second type of loan mentioned, 'paperless payday loans no credit check,' provides a convenient option for individuals with poor credit history, as they are approved quickly without credit checks. These loans can cover various expenses but should be repaid within a specified period to minimize fees. Installment payday loans offer longer repayment terms with monthly installments, making them suitable for larger expenses.\n\nApplying for these loans requires basic eligibility criteria, such as being a permanent UK resident, employed, and having a stable income. Credit checks are not mandatory for some lenders, making them accessible to a wider range of borrowers.\n\nLastly, the passage briefly mentions the convenience of applying for loans online, where applicants can quickly fill out forms and receive approval without leaving their homes. This digital process streamlines the loan application and verification process.\n\nIn summary, the news focuses on alternative lending options, including fast cash loans with varying terms and requirements, catering to individuals with different financial needs and credit situations.

Dudley's pay hike came amidst a $5.2 billion loss for the company, which led to job cuts and cost savings in response to the plummeting oil prices.\n\nWhile Dudley's performance, including safety improvements and financial management, was acknowledged, critics pointed to pay cuts at rival companies and the challenging industry conditions. Despite the criticism, Dudley's pay was considered competitive with industry peers, with his base salary remaining relatively flat and the bulk of the increase tied to his pension and deferred bonus shares.\n\nBP's board, however, is under pressure to reconsider its pay policies following the strong shareholder backlash.

Named after the Mandarin words for \"rainbow\" and \"big crest,\" the dinosaur had vibrant feathers, particularly on its head, neck, and chest, which shone like a hummingbird's. The feathers, analyzed using microscopes, revealed melanosomes, the pigment-producing structures, suggesting a rainbow of colors. Caihong had a theropod body with a Velociraptor-like skull and crested appearance, but its feathers indicate a possible connection to the evolution of flight, with asymmetrical feathers found on its tail, a trait later seen in birds.\n\nThe dinosaur's feathers were not only colorful but also diverse, ranging from linear and pennaceous to sinuous and down-like. The presence of feathers on the head, neck, and chest suggests they may have served social or sexual display purposes, similar to modern birds. Caihong's feathers were also found to be preserved in a way that indicates they might have been used for aerodynamic purposes, supporting the theory that feathers evolved for both display and flight.\n\nThe dinosaur's small size and relatively short bony tail suggest it was not capable of powered flight, but its feathers hint at the possibility of gliding or using its plumage for courtship displays. The discovery pushes the understanding of dinosaur coloration and the diversity of feather types during the Jurassic period.\n\nCaihong's anatomy, including its relatively short limbs and bird-like forelimbs, places it within the Paraves group, with similarities to both basal troodontids and dromaeosaurids. The presence of feathers on the dinosaur's tail, which is a synapomorphy of the Avialae clade, suggests a link to the origins of birds.\n\nThe study also highlights the potential for coloration and feather diversity in non-avian dinosaurs, with Caihong's feathers occupying a unique position in the fossil record. The discovery of iridescent nanostructures in the dinosaur's feathers, resembling those of modern birds, provides insights into the complexity of dinosaur plumage and the possibility of vibrant colors in the past.\n\nOverall, the find of Caihong juji represents a significant step in understanding the evolution of coloration and feather function in dinosaurs, offering a glimpse into a more colorful and potentially more avian-like world during the Jurassic era.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones?

Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

This shift, evident in a study examining over 258,000 patients between 1998 and 2011, highlights the need for reevaluating screening guidelines, as younger patients tend to present with more advanced disease and require different treatment approaches. Younger patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer were found to have a higher likelihood of surgery, radiation therapy, and slightly longer survival rates despite having more aggressive disease at diagnosis.\n\nThe study suggests that by 2030, rectal cancer will be diagnosed in nearly one in four patients under 50, and one in 10 colon cancers will affect those younger than 50. This shift calls for increased awareness among healthcare providers to recognize the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients, as early detection is crucial. However, the study's limitations include a lack of family history data and the possibility of selection bias in treatment decisions.\n\nWhile the exact reasons for the rising incidence in younger adults are not fully understood, factors like smoking, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle may contribute. Some experts argue that screening guidelines may need to be reconsidered for high-risk individuals, but the cost-benefit of universal age reduction is uncertain.\n\nThe findings emphasize the importance of vigilance in recognizing symptoms like anemia, unexplained blood in stool, and changes in bowel habits, particularly for those with a family history of the disease.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The site, found accidentally by a colleague's need for a toilet break, holds significant implications for understanding human settlement in the region. The shelter contains sophisticated tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon optatum, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, suggesting early colonization and hunting practices. The presence of artefacts and fireplaces pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the area, potentially challenging the conventional belief that the first Australians arrived around 50,000 years ago.\n\nExcavations at the site, led by archaeologist Giles Hamm and involving meticulous techniques, revealed a rich cache of 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments. The discovery includes the oldest-known use of ochre in Australia, pushing back the timeline for technological advancements like bone tools, stone axes, and the development of hafted axes. The site also provides evidence of human-megafauna interaction, with bone fragments from Diprotodon and a megabird, supporting the theory that humans may have coexisted with and possibly contributed to the extinction of megafauna.\n\nThe find, dated through optical dating and radiocarbon analysis, suggests a rapid expansion of human presence in the arid interior, contradicting the notion of a delayed colonization. The discovery, which has been validated by independent methods, has significant implications for our understanding of the adaptability and innovation of the first Australians, challenging Eurocentric views on their material culture.\n\nThe site, located in the Flinders Ranges, is not only historically important but also resonates with local Indigenous knowledge, as Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard's ancestors had stories of similar locations.

{"pred": "This summary highlights the concept of galactic-scale energy acquisition and the search for advanced civilizations in the universe, as outlined in recent scientific papers and popular science discussions. Astrophysicist Dan Hooper's paper, based on Nikolai Kardashev's three-stage model, suggests that civilizations aiming to expand and secure energy resources would eventually move from harvesting their own planet's resources (Type I) to nearby stars (Type II) to combat the expanding universe's isolation. To achieve this, they would potentially employ massive structures like Dyson spheres, which consist of solar-powered satellites forming a shell around a star to capture and transmit energy.\n\nHooper proposes that civilizations at the Type II stage would be aware of the need to harness energy from distant stars before they become inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of the universe driven by dark energy. This could lead to observable signs, such as stars being accelerated by energy extraction or unusual light signatures in galaxies where stars have been harvested.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres and other advanced energy-harvesting structures, like Stapledon's \"star makers\" and Dyson's original proposal, have been discussed in science fiction and now gain scientific traction. While humanity is currently in the early stages of technological advancement, the possibility of encountering older, more advanced civilizations is considered. These civilizations would likely be engaged in securing energy from stars, potentially leading to distinctive patterns in the light spectra of galaxies, which could serve as indicators of their presence.\n\nThe quest to understand and locate extraterrestrial life involves monitoring for unusual light signatures, star acceleration, and the disappearance of stars from their parent galaxies, as these could suggest the activity of an expanding civilization.

Researchers, using data from three papers published in Science, suggest that dramatic climate shifts in East Africa around 320,000 years ago may have catalyzed toolmaking advancements and trading networks among Homo sapiens or their relatives. The excavated Middle Stone Age tools, the oldest of their kind, indicate a shift towards smaller, more specialized instruments, possibly signaling increased mobility and trade due to unpredictable food sources caused by climate fluctuations.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya reveals a progression from simple stone tools to the Middle Stone Age tools, some of which were made from obsidian sourced from afar, suggesting long-distance connections and trade. The presence of obsidian and pigment表明人类可能 formed trading networks to access resources, a key factor in the success of early Homo sapiens.\n\nThe research also connects these changes to the emergence of Homo sapiens, coinciding with shifts in climate patterns. However, it is uncertain whether the observed toolmaking was solely due to H. sapiens or a related species, as no definitive fossils have been found at the site. Climate fluctuations, possibly tied to Homo sapiens' adaptation to variable environments, are posited to have influenced tool design and social interactions.\n\nWhile the \"human revolution\" was once thought to have occurred around 40,000 years ago, recent discoveries push the timeline back to at least 320,000 years ago. Archaeological evidence from the Olorgesailie Basin shows technological innovations like standardized stone tools, obsidian procurement, and pigment use, suggesting the presence of complex behaviors and potentially early forms of social networking.\n\nThe Olorgesailie findings, along with genetic evidence, imply that the Middle Stone Age tools and cultural developments may have predated the rise of Homo sapiens, challenging the traditional narrative of a single \"revolutionary\" event. Instead, gradual cultural changes and adaptations to environmental pressures appear to have shaped the cognitive abilities and social structures of early humans, possibly including Homo sapiens and their ancestors.\n\nAs researchers continue to uncover more data, the picture of human evolution becomes clearer, revealing a continuous process of adaptation and innovation rather than a sudden \"revolution.\" The study of these ancient tool-making cultures helps us understand the roots of human ingenuity and the complex behaviors that emerged in response to environmental changes, setting the stage for the development of modern humans.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Gibson denies these claims, stating that all purchases from Madagascar were legal and that they stopped importing from the country after a coup.

A massive ancient ocean, estimated to be around five times the size of the Atlantic Ocean, covered nearly half of Mars' northern hemisphere 4 billion years ago, according to NASA scientists. This ancient ocean, up to a mile deep, was formed by an enormous amount of water, enough to create a global ocean reaching 137 meters in depth. The water contained a significant amount of heavy water, indicating substantial water loss over time.\n\nThe research, conducted by NASA and international partners, involved studying variations in the Martian atmosphere's water molecules, particularly the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen. The findings suggest that Mars had a warmer and wetter climate than previously believed, with long-lasting lakes, river deltas, and possibly seas. This oceanic period persisted for millions of years, providing a more conducive environment for potential habitability.\n\nThe presence of a large ancient ocean implies that Mars had enough water to cover the entire planet to a depth of about 137 meters, with the majority of it concentrated in the northern lowlands. This discovery challenges earlier assumptions about the sporadic nature of water on Mars and strengthens the case for the possibility of past habitability.\n\nWhile the Curiosity rover has already confirmed the existence of standing water for 1.5 billion years, these new findings extend the timeline of wetness on Mars. The presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere, although not necessarily implying life, adds to the intrigue about the planet's past habitability.\n\nAs research continues, the search for signs of life on Mars intensifies, with the upcoming Exomars rover mission set to explore further.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "In a recent legal development, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) dismissed appeals by Nestlé, the maker of Kit Kat, and Mondelez (Cadbury's parent company) regarding the shape of the iconic four-fingered chocolate bar. Nestlé had been attempting to trademark the shape of its Kit Kat since 2002, arguing that it was distinctive enough to be protected. However, the court ruled that the shape alone was not enough to warrant trademark protection, requiring evidence of distinctiveness across all EU member states, not just a significant part. This decision affects not only Kit Kat but also rival products like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which can now potentially use the four-fingered shape without infringing on Nestlé's trademark. The case highlights the need for a strong case of distinctiveness in all EU markets for a product to maintain trademark status.\n\nThe Kit Kat shape saga dates back to 2002 when Nestlé applied for a shape trademark, leading to a lengthy legal battle. In 2012, the EU trademark office initially upheld Nestlé's claim, but Mondelez challenged it. The ECJ's recent ruling requires Nestlé to provide evidence of distinctiveness across the entire EU, not just certain markets, making it difficult for the company to reapply with the same argument. The outcome could lead to the eventual removal of Kit Kat's EU trademark for its shape.\n\nMeanwhile, the case has broader implications for trademark law, with other companies, like Lindt and Toblerone, facing similar battles over their product shapes. The ruling could prompt a reassessment of existing trademarks and shape-related protections in the chocolate industry.\n\nIn the UK, the Kit Kat shape case has been a point of contention, with some suggesting Brexit could impact the future of the brand if EU courts were seen as limiting its protection. The ruling may also affect Mondelez's attempts to trademark the purple color used by Cadbury's Dairy Milk bars, another ongoing legal dispute.\n\nOverall, the Kit Kat shape case serves as a reminder of the complexities of trademark law and the high standards required for a product's design to be protected, emphasizing the need for clear evidence of distinctiveness across the entire EU market.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

These closed-mouth vocalizations, which are common in birds with large esophageal pouches, could have been used for mating displays or territorial defense. The study, published in the journal Evolution, reveals that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved independently in birds and dinosaurs, hinting that dinosaurs might have communicated similarly to ostriches or cassowaries, with their throats puffing up to emit low-frequency sounds.\n\nThe creation of dinosaur sounds in movies like \"Jurassic Park\" relied heavily on animal recordings, with Velociraptors' calls modeled after a tortoise mating sound and the T. rex's roar a combination of elephant, tiger, and alligator noises. The study also notes that the iconic T. rex roar in the film was a cinematic invention, not based on fossil evidence.\n\nThe research also highlights the rarity of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds, with only a quarter of bird species producing such sounds, typically in large-bodied birds like doves and ostriches. The study suggests that this trait evolved independently in birds and dinosaurs, potentially indicating that some dinosaurs, particularly those with large bodies, could have had bird-like vocal abilities.\n\nWhile the exact sounds of dinosaurs remain largely speculative due to lack of fossil evidence, the study paves the way for future research combining paleontology, comparative biology, and sound modeling to better understand the vocal capabilities of these ancient creatures.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The report highlights a concern expressed by State Department officials during the attack that Marines' uniforms might hinder diplomacy, leading to discussions about the possibility of them wearing civilian clothing. The committee found that the Obama administration initially blamed the attack on an anti-Islam video, which was later contradicted by evidence suggesting it was a well-planned terrorist act, possibly linked to al-Qaeda affiliates.\n\nThe report exposes discrepancies between the public statements made by top officials, particularly Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and private communications where the true nature of the attack was acknowledged to be a terrorist event, not a protest or a response to a video. The administration's narrative shifted over time, with Clinton initially linking the attack to the video and later acknowledging its connection to terrorism.\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, criticized the committee's chairman, Trey Gowdy, for what he perceives as a lack of transparency and attempts to prevent accountability. Cummings argues that the report does not significantly alter the public's understanding of the attack, stating that key facts remain the same: there was no stand-down order, no attempt to politicize the situation, and no evidence of gun trading.\n\nThe report includes new criticism of Hillary Clinton, with the committee concluding that she and other officials did not adequately address the growing extremism in Libya and falsely attributed the violence to the video, despite knowing it was a terrorist attack. The report's release comes amid a contentious investigation, with both parties accusing each other of partisanship and suppressing information.\n\nIn conclusion, the Benghazi Select Committee's final report reveals a discrepancy between the public statements and private communications of key officials, focusing on the administration's handling of the attack, including the role of the video and the military's readiness.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked.

A source tells UK magazine Look the actor sent Holmes an \"emotional letter\" looking to, at the very least, be friends again, Australia's News Network reports. \"It's like he's finally recognized that Katie will always be the love of his life,\" the source says. Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one.

{"pred": "Billionaire couple Barry and Honey Sherman, founders of the Canadian pharmaceutical company Apotex, were found dead in their Toronto mansion under suspicious circumstances. The police initially classified the deaths as \"suspicious\" but not a homicide, though later investigations led to the homicide squad taking over the case. The cause of death was determined to be ligature neck compression, suggesting strangulation. The couple's recent email correspondence indicated they were planning a trip to Florida, with Honey's message expressing excitement for their annual vacation. Friends and family denied the initial report of a murder-suicide, stating the couple's personalities and commitment to their family were inconsistent with such a theory. The Shermans had no recent financial issues, and Barry was reportedly passionate about his work at Apotex, while Honey was a prominent philanthropist involved in various charitable organizations. The police investigation remains ongoing, with theories ranging from murder-suicide to foul play, but the family disputes these claims.

Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists.

{"pred": "In Egypt, the country held its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to lead, followed by the more conservative Nour party. The elections, held amidst ongoing trials of former President Hosni Mubarak, who was accused of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression, have raised concerns about the balance of power between the military, the Brotherhood, and other political factions. The military rulers face opposition from protesters demanding an end to their rule before the June presidential elections. Economic challenges, including a decline in foreign currency reserves and a struggling stock market, loom as the new parliament's formation remains uncertain.\n\nThe Brotherhood aims to form a coalition or unity government, while also attempting to reassure both liberals and international stakeholders. However, their potential clear majority could lead to increased influence and potentially limit the power of rival parties like the Salafi Nour party. The military's role in governance is also in question, with the new parliament expected to challenge the military's authority, particularly over the appointment of a prime minister.\n\nMubarak's trial continued, with the prosecution accusing him of corruption and ordering violence against protesters, seeking the \"harshest penalty.\" The outcome of the elections and Mubarak's trial reflect the political landscape in Egypt, with the possibility of a new era of alliances and power dynamics as the country navigates its post-Mubarak transition.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes.

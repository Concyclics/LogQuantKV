Studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have demonstrated that exposure to cigarette smoke increases MRSA's resistance to antibiotics and impairs the effectiveness of the immune system in combating the bacteria. When MRSA is exposed to smoke, it becomes more adherent to human cells and develops a higher tolerance to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, making it harder to kill.\n\nIn one study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, macrophages, which are responsible for fighting off infections, had difficulty killing MRSA exposed to smoke. The bacteria's cell walls were altered, allowing it to resist the immune system's defenses. A similar effect was observed with e-cigarette smoke, although the resistance was more pronounced in MRSA exposed to traditional cigarette smoke.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke not only poses health risks to smokers but also acts as a catalyst for the growth and persistence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The enhanced resistance of MRSA to immune responses could contribute to increased infections in smokers and complicate treatment. The researchers emphasize the need for further understanding of this phenomenon to develop strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and promote public health.\n\nThe studies highlight the importance of quitting smoking, as it not only protects the smoker but also reduces the likelihood of spreading antibiotic-resistant bacteria to others.

No specific treatment has been proven to significantly improve outcomes, with recovery rates varying; 85% of children partially recovered in 2014, but only three fully recovered.\n\nThe condition is concerning because of its rapid onset, with patients losing control of their limbs and respiratory function.

Researchers from Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Pavia, led by Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, have analyzed the bloodstain patterns on the cloth using a combination of live subject tests and simulations. Their study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggests that the stains do not match the expected patterns for a crucifixion scenario, such as a 90-degree angle between the wrist and elbow or a consistent flow from a spear wound. Instead, the researchers found inconsistencies, like the hand and forearm angles being at odds with each other and the lack of a replicated blood belt in the lower back, pointing to a standing model being used to create the image, rather than a crucified or dead body.\n\nThe shroud, which is believed by some to date back to the 13th or 14th century, has long been a subject of scientific scrutiny. Radiocarbon dating places it within that timeframe, but the recent forensic analysis questions the possibility of the bloodstains accurately representing a crucifixion event. The shroud's image, which shows a man seemingly crucified, has intrigued scientists and believers alike, with the Vatican considering it more of a symbol than a historical artifact.\n\nWhile the investigation does not definitively prove the shroud's inauthenticity, it adds weight to previous claims and raises questions about its authenticity.

Quick cash loans, such as 1 hour and 2 hours no credit loans, are highlighted as a solution for those in need of immediate funds for emergencies like electricity bills, medical expenses, and car repairs. These loans often have high-interest rates and fees, emphasizing the importance of understanding the costs involved.\n\nPaperless payday loans without credit checks are mentioned as a convenient option for individuals with poor credit history, but they come with the understanding that longer-term installment loans, like payday loans, require monthly payments and can be repaid over time. The interest rates on these loans are typically higher for the ease of access.\n\nApplying for loans with lenders requires basic eligibility criteria, including being a permanent resident of the UK, aged 18 or older, employed with a minimum income, and having a recent bank account. Credit checks may not be mandatory for some loans, making them accessible to those with a poor credit history.\n\nThe appeal of these loans lies in their flexibility, catering to short-term needs, but borrowers should be cautious about the potential for high fees and the long-term impact on their finances. Online applications make the process faster, with applicants filling out simple forms for instant approval.\n\nIn summary, the news passages emphasize the availability of quick cash loans for emergencies, the importance of considering the costs and terms, and the varying requirements for approval, particularly for those with less-than-perfect credit.

Named after the Mandarin words for \"rainbow\" and \"big crest,\" the dinosaur had vibrant feathers, particularly on its head, neck, and chest, which shone like a hummingbird's. The feathers, analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, revealed melanosomes similar to those in modern birds, suggesting a range of vivid colors, possibly including rainbow hues.\n\nCaihong had a mix of dinosaur and bird-like features, with a Velociraptor-like skull, crested head, and sharp teeth, but it lacked the ability to fly, as its feathers were more likely for display purposes. Its small size and relatively short tail indicated a ground-dwelling lifestyle, while its plumage, including extensive feathering on the head, neck, and tail, suggests it may have had a colorful display for attracting mates or social signaling.\n\nThe dinosaur's feathers provide insights into the evolution of coloration, with its unique nanostructures resembling iridescent melanosomes found in hummingbird feathers. This suggests that the dinosaur's feathers could have displayed a range of vivid colors, possibly including rainbow shades. The presence of asymmetrical feathers on the tail, reminiscent of the frond-shaped tails seen in some early birds, indicates a possible connection to the origin of flight.\n\nWhile Caihong's feathers were similar to those of other paravians, its combination of bird-like features and dinosauric characteristics makes it a crucial link in understanding the evolution of feathered dinosaurs. The discovery pushes back the timeline of colorful and potentially flight-related adaptations in dinosaurs, challenging our understanding of dinosaurian display behaviors and the origins of avian traits.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation.

Rescuers found the 53-year-old librarian's body at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff with a fractured skull. At a hearing Friday, Jane's was ruled an accidental death due, in part, to using an app instead of a map. \"Apart from potential difficulties caused by poor detail on an electronic map, batteries on mobile phones have a nasty habit of running out just when you need them most,\" the Telegraph quotes a spokesperson for Mountain Rescue England and Wales as saying. A detective says the app map \"would have been small and not as detailed\" and took the couple on a route that was not the safest.

Pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen, particularly for reducing fever, had a higher likelihood of their children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related conditions. The researchers, using data from a Danish study involving 64,000 children, found that maternal acetaminophen use was associated with a 29% increased risk of ADHD and a 37% increased risk of hyperkinetic syndrome. However, the study does not establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, and experts caution against drawing definitive conclusions without further research.\n\nWhile the study suggests that acetaminophen may interfere with fetal brain development, it does not imply that taking the drug during pregnancy is entirely unsafe. Pregnant women are often advised to take acetaminophen for mild pain relief, but the findings prompt recommendations to avoid frequent or long-term use, especially when treating infections like flu, which can already impact brain development. The study does not compare acetaminophen to other pain relievers like ibuprofen, as they were less commonly used by pregnant women.\n\nThe report highlights the complexity of the issue, with possible influences from hormonal changes during pregnancy, genetics, and unmeasured factors.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Target's breach, which occurred during the holiday season, saw the theft of credit and debit card data from 40 million customers, along with potentially 70 million additional individuals whose personal information was also stolen. The breach at Neiman Marcus, while not disclosing the scale of the data theft, did not involve collecting PINs.\n\nBoth breaches were attributed to sophisticated malware, with Target's attack using a type of software that infiltrated point-of-sale systems, stealing credit card data in the authorization process.

This study, based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data from 1998 to 2011, found that younger patients were more likely to have advanced-stage cancer, requiring more aggressive treatment. While younger patients had a higher survival rate due to earlier detection and treatment, they faced a greater risk of advanced disease upon diagnosis.\n\nThe study highlights the need for earlier screening, as younger patients were more inclined to receive surgery and radiation therapy compared to older patients. However, the lack of family history data and the possibility of selection bias in the study call for further investigation. The traditional recommendation to start colorectal cancer screenings at age 50 is being reconsidered, with some experts suggesting that younger patients with risk factors should be screened sooner.\n\nIn addition to colorectal cancer, the prevalence of the disease in both men and women under 50 is rising, prompting a wake-up call for the medical community to be vigilant for signs in younger patients. Symptoms like anemia, unexplained bowel changes, and dark blood in stool should not be overlooked, even in younger individuals.\n\nWhile the study's implications are significant, more research is needed to determine if earlier screening guidelines should be revised.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The site, found by chance when a colleague needed a toilet break, holds significant implications for understanding the early settlement of Australia. The shelter contains sophisticated tools, bone fragments from the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, suggesting a lifestyle that predates the previously accepted timeframe of 50,000 years ago. The presence of artefacts, burnt remains, and the oldest known use of ochre in Australia challenge the notion of a slow migration pattern and indicate a quicker colonization than previously believed.\n\nThe excavation, led by archaeologist Giles Hamm and involving 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments, revealed a complex history with stratified deposits and potential evidence of human settlement and interaction with extinct megafauna. Excavation methods were meticulous, with hand excavation, grid systems, and careful documentation of findings. Optical dating techniques, including single-grain OSL and TT-OSL, were employed to date the site, providing a more precise timeline.\n\nThe discovery pushes back the timeline of human settlement in the arid interior, challenging the notion that the first Australians arrived later than previously thought. The presence of bone and stone tools, as well as the coexistence with megafauna, suggests a more complex and earlier relationship with the environment than previously acknowledged. This finding supports the theory that humans could have reached Australia earlier than 50,000 years ago, possibly as early as 55,000 to 60,000 years ago.\n\nThe study, published in Nature, contributes to a reevaluation of the narrative around the arrival and adaptation of early humans in Australia, highlighting their rapid spread and technological advancements, including the development of stone and bone tools, and the use of ochre. The discovery also prompts a reconsideration of the role of humans in the extinction of megafauna, as evidenced by the presence of bones from extinct species like Diprotodon and a giant bird.\n\nThe site, which includes the Adnyamathanha people's cultural heritage, is expected to be deposited in museums and open to the public after a 6-12 month period, pending permissions.

Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev's three-step model of technological advancement, known as the Kardashev Scale, suggests that civilizations progress from Type I (planet-bound), through Type II (star-bound), to Type III (galaxy-bound) by harnessing increasing amounts of energy. A recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, proposes that as civilizations advance, they would inevitably attempt to capture energy from distant stars to counteract the expanding universe's isolation. This could involve constructing Dyson spheres or other mega-structures, such as solar-powered satellites, to capture and redirect starlight.\n\nHooper's work connects the search for alien life with the need for energy security, as civilizations would strive to secure stars before they become inaccessible due to the accelerating expansion of the universe caused by dark energy. Advanced civilizations, like those described in science fiction, might employ techniques like forming Dyson spheres or statites (solar-powered satellites) to maintain access to energy resources. These structures would enable civilizations to expand their reach and potentially be detected by unusual light signatures, like increased infrared radiation or specific wavelengths in the spectrum of a galaxy with harvested stars.\n\nWhile humans are currently at a relatively early stage on the Kardashev Scale, with estimates suggesting we might reach Type II within millennia, the possibility of encountering alien civilizations with much older and more advanced technologies is raised. The presence of Dyson spheres or other massive energy-harvesting structures could serve as telltale signs of such civilizations, providing a potential avenue for future astronomical observations and the search for extraterrestrial life.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Initially, the show started as a continuation of the Kilborn-era format but Stewart's arrival marked a shift in tone and direction. He clashed with the existing writers, who were resistant to change, leading to a period of tension and power struggles. Key hires, such as Ben Karlin and Stephen Colbert, played significant roles in shaping the show's success. Karlin brought a focus on hypocrisy and political relevance, while Colbert's on-air presence as a straight-faced correspondent complemented Stewart's style.\n\nColbert's addition, along with correspondent Steve Carell, helped elevate the show's profile. The team began targeting politicians and media, distinguishing themselves from competitors like Craig Kilborn's Daily Show. Stewart's debut was marked by a clash with the staff's established norms, but he eventually gained control and steered the show towards a more pointed, purposeful satire. The Daily Show's coverage of the 2000 presidential campaign, particularly Jon Stewart's questioning of Senator John McCain during a field piece, marked a turning point, pushing the show into the national spotlight and gaining critical acclaim.\n\nThe show's success was fueled by its ability to deconstruct news and media conventions, often using it as a platform to critique politics. The format evolved, with Stewart's team focusing on politicians and the media's hypocrisies, setting it apart from traditional news programs. The bookend moments of the Kilborn era, like the \"fuck-you meeting,\" highlight the internal conflicts that ultimately led to a stronger, more assertive Stewart-led show.\n\nNotable correspondents, like Colbert and Carell, brought a fresh dynamic to the screen, with Carell's character often playing the role of a clueless but entertaining reporter. The show's rise coincided with the rise of cable news and the internet, positioning The Daily Show as a voice for a younger, disillusioned audience.\n\nIn conclusion, Jon Stewart's tenure as host of The Daily Show transformed the show from a niche comedy program to a political satire powerhouse, influencing the way audiences consumed news and commentary.

{"pred": "A series of groundbreaking discoveries in the field of paleoanthropology challenge our understanding of human evolution and the development of complex behaviors. Researchers, using data from three papers published in Science, suggest that dramatic shifts in East African climate around 320,000 years ago may have catalyzed toolmaking advancements and trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. The excavated Middle Stone Age tools, the oldest of their kind, indicate a gradual transition from simpler handheld cutting tools to more specialized, smaller stone implements like obsidian-based spearpoints. These changes suggest increased mobility, foraging over larger areas, and possibly long-distance trade.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya reveals a timeline of climate-driven behavioral changes, with evidence of tool innovations possibly linked to Homo sapiens or a related species. The tools, made from obsidian sourced from afar, imply the existence of trading networks. Climate fluctuations, marked by frequent shifts, forced hominids to adapt and expand their resource acquisition strategies.\n\nThe Middle Stone Age tools, dating back to around 300,000 years ago, are seen as a result of the need to cope with unpredictable food sources due to shifting landscapes. While it's uncertain who exactly made these tools, the Olorgesailie findings align with the emergence of Homo sapiens and their ancestors' ability to adapt to changing environments.\n\nPotts and his colleagues argue that climate variability, not necessarily a sudden event, played a significant role in shaping early humans' cognitive abilities and social networks. The discovery of obsidian tools and pigment use suggests the possibility of complex communication and symbolic expression, hinting at the roots of modern human behaviors.\n\nThe Olorgesailie research also challenges the traditional view of a \"human revolution\" around 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence points to a gradual transformation that began much earlier, possibly involving multiple hominid species. The study of tool forms, raw materials, and cultural expressions like pigment use indicates a progression of complex behaviors and social interactions that predate the arrival of Homo sapiens in Africa.\n\nAs researchers continue to unravel the complexities of the Middle Stone Age, they emphasize the importance of considering climate change, technological innovation, and social connections in shaping the development of our species. The Olorgesailie findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that questions the strict distinction between early and modern humans, suggesting a more gradual and interconnected history of human evolution.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Previously, Kieran had partial hearing due to a hearing aid, and he expressed a desire for larger ears since the age of six. The surgery, a major milestone, took six hours and involved harvesting rib cartilage for the ear frameworks, which were then grafted onto his head.

This is the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been granted such a right, potentially signaling a shift in how courts view the legal status of non-human entities. The Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP), which filed the case, argues that the chimps' cognitive complexity merits their release from captivity and relocation to a sanctuary. The initial lawsuit sought to free the animals from what NhRP claims are inhumane conditions, claiming they are entitled to liberty based on their cognitive abilities.\n\nThe Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006, which revoked habeas corpus rights for certain individuals labeled \"enemy combatants,\" remains a concern, as it allows for the suspension of fundamental legal protections.

{"pred": "Recent studies have shed new light on the water history of Mars, revealing a massive ancient ocean that once covered a significant portion of the planet's northern hemisphere. This ancient ocean, estimated to be around 20 million cubic kilometers in size, was comparable to the Atlantic Ocean on Earth and persisted for millions of years, providing a potentially habitable environment. The ocean's existence is inferred from the detection of high levels of deuterium, a heavier form of hydrogen, in the Martian atmosphere. This enrichment suggests a substantial amount of water loss, with the planet having had a global water layer at least 137 meters deep.\n\nThe ocean, which was up to a mile deep in some areas, was a key factor in shaping Mars' climate and geology. It supported the formation of river systems, deltas, and possibly even long-lasting lakes, providing a more stable and wetter environment than previously believed. Mars' water loss, primarily due to atmospheric escape, led to the formation of a thick ice layer on the poles, with the remaining water equivalent to about 13% of the original ocean.\n\nThe presence of this ancient ocean raises the possibility of past habitability on Mars, as the conditions were conducive to the evolution of life. However, the exact extent of the water and its role in supporting life remain speculative. Notably, the Curiosity rover has already discovered evidence of liquid water on Mars lasting for over 1.5 billion years, further supporting the likelihood of past habitability.\n\nIn addition to the ancient ocean, recent methane detections on Mars have sparked interest in the potential for life, although it is unclear whether the methane is biological or geological in origin. The search for signs of life on Mars, including the upcoming Exomars mission, will continue to focus on the search for chemical signatures and potential habitats.\n\nOverall, these findings significantly expand our understanding of Mars' watery past and its potential for supporting life, making the red planet an even more intriguing target for astrobiological research.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Despite the charismatic performances by Smith and Robbie, the movie is criticized for its lack of depth and truthfulness, with its absurd plot points and reliance on Will Smith's charm rather than substance.\n\nSmith's portrayal of Nicky is highlighted as a blend of suave manipulation and a certain cool detachment, reminiscent of his earlier roles. The film's climax involves a series of high-stakes cons, including a scene at a football game, but the implausibility of these sequences detracts from the narrative. The relationship between Nicky and Jess is not convincing due to Smith's limited range as a leading man, despite Robbie's strong performance as the ambitious and adaptable Jess.\n\nThe casting process for the film was itself a story, with numerous A-list actors reportedly attached to the project before Will Smith and Margot Robbie secured the roles.

{"pred": "In a recent legal battle between Nestlé, the maker of Kit Kat, and Mondelez, which owns brands like Cadbury, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has dismissed Nestlé's appeals to maintain the trademark on the shape of the Kit Kat four-fingered wafer. The court ruled that Nestlé failed to prove the shape was distinctive enough across all EU member states, requiring evidence of recognition in every country, not just a significant part. This decision affects the protected status of Kit Kat's shape, potentially opening the door for competitors like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj and allowing for generic four-fingered chocolate snacks in supermarkets.\n\nThe case, which started in 2002, saw Nestlé attempting to trademark the shape as early as 2004, with Mondelez, owner of Cadbury, opposing it. The ECJ's ruling states that a trademark must demonstrate distinctiveness across the entire EU, not just certain regions. The Kit Kat shape, while iconic, does not meet this requirement based on the current evidence.\n\nThis ruling has implications beyond Kit Kat, as it sets a precedent for evaluating the distinctiveness of other trademarked products' shapes. For instance, while Nestlé's attempt to trademark Toblerone's shape was successful, the case highlights the need for clear evidence of distinctiveness across all EU markets.\n\nThe Kit Kat shape losing its EU trademark could lead to more generic-looking chocolate treats entering the market, potentially impacting Nestlé's position and opening up opportunities for rival brands. However, Nestlé is not giving up, stating that it will continue to pursue the matter with the EU Intellectual Property Office, potentially reapplying with stronger evidence of distinctiveness.\n\nIn parallel, the case has also been compared to other disputes, such as Cadbury's failed attempt to trademark the purple color of its Dairy Milk bars and a similar shape battle involving Lindt's gold Easter bunnies. These cases further emphasize the importance of national and EU-level trademark laws for global chocolate giants.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

{"pred": "New research challenges the iconic image of the T. rex's roar, suggesting that the dinosaur likely didn't sound like the fierce, high-pitched creature portrayed in films like \"Jurassic Park.\" Scientists argue that the T. rex, along with other dinosaurs, may have produced sounds more akin to today's birds, such as cooing or a low, throaty mumble. These closed-mouth vocalizations, facilitated by an esophageal pouch, are believed to have evolved multiple times in different lineages, including birds and crocodiles, and could have been present in some dinosaur species. The study, published in the journal Evolution, relies on vocal data from living birds and crocodiles to infer the sounds of their extinct relatives.\n\nIn the realm of Jurassic Park, sound designers employed unconventional methods to create the dinosaurs' vocalizations. For instance, the T. rex's roar was a composite of various animal sounds, including a baby elephant's cry, a tiger's growl, and an alligator's gurgle, resulting in a cinematic effect rather than a scientifically accurate representation. Velociraptors, on the other hand, had sounds influenced by goose vocalizations, with hissing noises resembling a goose's angry hiss.\n\nThe movie's creators also drew upon real-life animal sounds for other dinosaurs, like the Gallimimus's flock resembling a horse gallop and the T. rex's roar using a baby elephant's sound slowed down. The Dilophosaurus, known for its iconic \"trill\" in the film, was based on a swan's hoot, while the Triceratops's distinctive calls involved a cardboard tube and a reverb effect.\n\nWhile the exact dinosaur vocalizations remain largely speculative due to lack of fossil evidence, the study suggests that dinosaurs might have communicated in ways similar to birds, with some species possibly using closed-mouth vocalizations for mating displays or territorial defense. The discovery of closed-mouth vocalizations in multiple dinosaur lineages indicates that this trait could have evolved independently in different groups, including dinosaurs.\n\nAs dinosaurs are often associated with roars, the fact that some may have sounded like ostriches or cassowaries adds a new layer of complexity to our understanding of prehistoric life.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

It's a method called \"spearphishing,\" according to the New York Times. \"It was very convincing,\" Mike Murray of the cybersecurity firm Lookout tells CNN, adding that it would be tough to tell the real page from the fake one, even if they were side-by-side. The fake login page was ultimately removed by the cloud hosting company DigitalOcean. The company's chief security officer says the threat was identified before the attack was launched. \"We see no evidence that any sensitive data was stolen,\" he says. A DNC official tells the Times that it is not clear who the hackers were in this case. But, the paper recalls, a 2016 hack of the DNC was ultimately traced to Russia. This latest attempt, DNC Chief Security Officer Bob Lord tells the Times, \"is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks.\" Earlier this week, Microsoft reported that it had uncovered new Russian hacking attempts targeting conservative organizations in the US."], "all_classes": null, "length": 716}

The study, which analyzed 188 countries, found that obesity rates are rising worldwide, affecting men, women, and children across income levels. Developed countries like the US have higher obesity rates, while obesity is also prevalent in developing nations, with some countries reaching extraordinary levels such as 50%+ in men in Kuwait and Samoa, and 65%+ in women in Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe obesity epidemic is accompanied by hunger in many areas, highlighting the interconnectedness of these health issues. Factors contributing to obesity include increased caloric intake, changes in diet, reduced physical activity, and shifts in gut bacteria.

In wealthy countries, obesity growth has slowed, but in developing nations, it continues to accelerate.\n\nThe Lancet report calls for urgent action to address this growing health crisis, as obesity is linked to numerous chronic diseases.

The military-controlled government faces criticism for its handling of the election and Mubarak's trial, with protests planned for the anniversary of Mubarak's ousting.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood aims to maintain its lead in the new parliament, potentially securing a majority, while also seeking to balance their influence with a desire for a more liberal presence. Economic challenges persist, with Egypt experiencing a decline in tourism and foreign currency reserves due to political instability. The outcome of the elections could impact the power dynamics between the military, Brotherhood, and other political factions.\n\nIn Mubarak's trial, the prosecution presented a strong case against him, describing him as a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence against protesters. The court adjourned until the next day, with the possibility of a harsh penalty.
